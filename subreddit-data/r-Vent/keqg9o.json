    "postText": "I say white men because that is literally the demographic I SEE. They come to these impoverished countries, don\u2019t wear condoms when they have sex with prostitutes(majority who are just trying to survive) and get to go back to their comfortable homes in first world countries while their children starve, don\u2019t get an education , and ultimately are cycles into being a prostitute. They are left with identity crises and with no father figure. This is modern day colonization. And let\u2019s not talk about the fact that a majority also have sex with underage children, nasty pedophiles. I watched a documentary where these child r*pe victims (it\u2019s not sex work, it\u2019s rape what they do these kids) were being rehabilitated and as part of therapy, they were put in a cushony room where they could hit the wall and yell. These poor girls were traumatized from being sold to make money. \n\nThese men fucking repulse me and then you see them flirting with these young, pretty women LIKE YOU ARE BALD, RED, AND HAVE A BEER BELLY holy shit the delusion to think they\u2019re actually into you. It\u2019s like these men try to feel young once again because women in their countries don\u2019t find grandpas attractive and won\u2019t feed into their delusions.",

You're exploiting people's need for money - you're not helping, it's exploitation\n2. Usually it targets younger girls who will at best earn money, at worst catch something from you, have a child, need therapy\n2.1 Children being targeted is rape, no other point needed.\n2.2 Though adults may be targeted if you go to a country that has a lot of poverty chances are sex workers never had the opportunity to attend school and thus develop critical thinking skills on a level that's considered normal in wealthy countries [they're not stupid, they're only struggling to survive the only way they know how]\n3.

You are suggesting that they don't possess the capacity to make decisions for themselves and that money is more important than their likes and dislikes. You are suggesting that they are automatically gold diggers. That is pretty disrespectful to devalue their mental fortitude. It seems to mirror the same mindset that these sexual tourists believe... That their opinions don't matter and that money can buy anything, even another person's body or morals.",

            "comment": "Okay first i wanna say that your feeling about those men is your own thing and i do not want to discuss that at all. \nThe point where i think your post is inaccurate is that you mix up several facettes of prostitution. \n\n1. child prostitution is simply disgusting and we do not need to talk about that at all. People that do that have to get punished.\n\n2. victims of human trafficking are poor souls and need evwry help they can get. By the way this happens all over the world. This is not an exclusive 3rd world issue. Often those women and sometimes even men get into these situations because of drug addiction or other personal issues that brought them into this situation so they have a bit of responsibility. Not all of them but some for sure. Do not get me wrong i am not defending tbose pimp assholes who rob them literally and abuse them mentally and physically. Those bastards need to be put down.\n\n3. a lot of women are fully aware of their doing and chose that way. They see that as a business and do it for a living. So whats wrong with that? I mean those women will have good clients and bad and i am sorry for those bad experiences but on the other hand they have chosen a dangerous 'profession'. A roofer also knows that he can fall of a big house and hurt himself badly. I wanna say those bad clients should burn in hell for their actions which are off the charts. Also these women have other choices in life. They could work unqualified jobs that brings them enough for a living but they chose to sell their bodies. \n\n4. there are surely cases of women that have no other choice than sell themselves. I am talking of those who went to for example Manila from rural phillipines hoping to find a job there but when they arrive they find out that there are not enough jobs for the people that live in Manila. In this case these women have in my opinion a high responsibility for their situation because when you look at the situation in the phillipines you know that you only can have a chance when you have a higher education and even then it is not guaranteed. Also they can go back home. usually families in south east asia take care of their members not like here. \n\n 5. the women that get pregnant during prostitution are making a big mistake by not buying contraceptives. I mean the pill does exist and it has a high reliability in preventing them from getting pregnant. Also there are other options than the pill and condoms and if they are in this situation it is just something they should invest in as when they get pregnant their situation surely will not get any better. None of their clients will be there for her or the kid and that is obvious all from the start. So they should act according to that situation to prevent more harm.",

    "postText": "I just really don't know if I'm maybe the problem and need an objective view. To note, I'm a minor and would prefer not to disclose my age.  \n\nWhen I was younger, my dad and I were pretty close. Like, we'd hang out everyday and take photos. I was practically the favorite child for him. However, when I grew up a bit (10-12), he irritated me so much. I became more distant, but isn't that like every teenager? For pretty much all my life besides when I was a toddler, I've been quite severely underweight. This wasn't due to any particular reasoning; even though I ate large portions I just could never really put on weight that easily. However my father didn't make the image of my body any better, especially during the stages of puberty where I'd nitpick all of my insecurities out. All the time around that age I was always told by my siblings and my parents that I should eat more, even though I do, but I'm still underweight. My father would sing lullabies OUT LOUD EVERY SINGLE TIME HE SAW ME about how when I was younger, I was so chubby and cute, but now I'm like a stick. He complains about why I changed so much. Those lullabies hurt so much, because I've tried gaining weight. He'd push food onto my plate with the excuse of helping me gain weight. I remember one Thanksgiving he pushed a bunch of turkey skin onto my bowl and it made me feel like vomiting. Then later on he'd go on a rant about eating healthy, while he's the one making me eat all this. To note, this extra food didn't help at all. My siblings didn't make it any better. They'd sing this one song that went along the lines of, \"My little pony, so skinny and bony. Went for a walk in the park. Sat on a wire, and fell in the fire, my little pony is dead.\" They sang it because of the skinny and bony part. My dad would even remind me of the song every once in a while. \n\nMy dad would constantly scream if anybody did something he didn't like, even over the pettiest things. My grandmother occasionally lives with us every few weeks, and once they had an argument because my grandma didn't know how to update her phone. He ended up calling her a wh\\*re and a b\\*tch at the dinner table. Then a few days later he'd complain about how we have to respect our parents, and learn to be good role models for our future children. He'd guilt trip me and siblings by telling us about stories, like one where when he was younger he dreamed of having children who were super good at STEM (when he was yelling at me for not understanding a math problem), and how he's so disappointed about how his children don't even listen to him. I just don't even want to talk to him at all anymore, cause every conversation ends with an argument. And if you even try to stand your ground, he'd just tell you to shut up and respect your elders. \n\nOnce I even had to beg him for 2 days straight to grow out my hair longer because he thought if I did it would be too 'mature'. When I eventually grew my hair out, he told me to put it in pig tails so I'd look more youthful. Once he even showed a picture of us together when I was younger, asking me who owned the little girl in the photo. I was so pissed, and replied that no one did. However, he told me to say that he owned the little girl, and wouldn't leave my room until I said it. It was so creepy, saying you 'own' your daughter like she's an object? Every time there's a conversation with him, it always ends up with an argument no doubt. I even started avoiding my dad, because he kept comparing me to when I was younger, saying I looked so much cuter back then. It really hurt, and when I told him to stop, he just said he was trying to remember the past. After 5th grade, I started being relieved every time I didn't see his car in the driveway after being picked up from school, which meant he wouldn't be home until the end of the day. Every time I saw him at home, I'd leave the room. I just wish he'd disappear. Every time he sees me, and keeps asking the question, \"Why'd you change so much?\" I'm not joking, every single time. I don't respond to him. I don't get why he can't just let me grow up. When I don't respond, he says, \"Why aren't you responding? Do you think you're a little woman now?\" It makes me feel so inferior, and he makes it seem like I should look like a 5 year old with the maturity of a grown adult. And I know, technically I'm still a kid, but I just wish he'd let me grow up, just a little bit. I don't even know the amount of tears I've shed for him, like how I'm crying typing this out right now. I feel like a horrible person complaining cause I know other people have it worse. But I feel like I'm in the wrong because I know I've changed a lot, but he has too. I get him sometimes, because I still see the old dad in him that didn't yell at me or argue with my siblings and mom.\n\nActually the old dad did some times I'll never forget. I remember when I was like 3, I shared a bedroom with just my mom, because my dad was a really loud snorer. I'll never forget the time when he decided to have sex with my mom in the middle of the night. Silently creeping into our bedroom, and he pushed pillows to cover my face. I ended up crying and running out of the room to my older sister's room. Didn't stop even when I got older. Our bathroom is right outside my father's room, as well as my bedroom. I remember even during school days, I'd usually wake up earlier before my alarm and go on my phone. My mother wakes up very early and do household chores, while my dad tends to stay in his room despite being awake. My mother would use the bathroom, and while she's in the bathroom I'd hear the door of his bedroom creak. This was my signal to put on headphones and hide under the covers. I don't wanna consider this r\\*pe, but it really sounds like it, even if they're married. My dad would pounce on my mother and carry her to his bed, even though I'd hear her complaining and telling him not to. She'd try to stop him, but it rarely worked. Then I'd hear him kissing her and her sounds of resistance. It made me cry. I don't even know why, but it made me cry, every single time.  I gonna be honest I learned what sex was from a really young age because of this. What'd scar me even more is going on my mother's phone to take a photo, and looking at her photos (she and my dad share the same account for photos), and seeing a sex video of them, all nude. Pretty sure he took it, as well as some p\\*rn I saw downloaded on her photos. He disgusts me, even though I know that's how I and all my siblings were created.  \n\n\nI just feel a pit in the bottom of my stomach. This was my rant, and I'd like to hear if I should just be more accepting of my dad.",

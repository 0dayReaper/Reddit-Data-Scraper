    "postText": "I already made a post about it but I\u2019ve been crying the past two days bc it hurts so much. I never thought losing a pet could hurt this bad, but they really are like a little human. They\u2019re family and i feel like this is my first time truly grieving someone. I didn\u2019t know losing him would affect me like this but now that he\u2019s gone i can\u2019t help but cry every time i think about him. I was so used to seeing him every day for the past 3 years. Every time i use the bathroom or am getting ready he would come in there and just sit with me. He\u2019d be waiting near the door for me when i got home. He\u2019d wake me up several times during the week at like 3am trying to break down the gate to his room. And every day when i got up for work I\u2019d see him snuggled up asleep in the spare bedroom in the corner bc i guess he preferred the carpet. Which now it pains me to look at not only for that reason but bc i found him there, lifeless. I had just checked on him a couple hours prior and he looked normal, just sitting there. But after a couple trips to the kitchen and noticing he hadn\u2019t been following me around like he usually does, i decided to check on him again and noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing and he was cold. I just broke down. I wish i knew that something was wrong with him or maybe i should\u2019ve taken care of him just a little better. I hate he couldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong. And it hurts me knowing that i wasn\u2019t there beside him when he passed away. He was all alone in there. I don\u2019t even know how long it had been when i initially found him :( He has helped me thru so much throughout the years; more than i even realized until now. He really was like my child lol. When i felt alone he cheered me up. He even moved to this new place with me, an hour away from home. It just sucks not having him here. Today we buried him alongside a creek near our apartment and planted some white flowers over top, i made sure to include his favorite treats and his plush bunny to keep him company. It hurts. i keep thinking about how alone and cold it is under ground and i wish i could hold him one more time. Anyways, I love you so much Mimzi. You were the coolest sweetest little bunny and I\u2019ll never ever forget about you. You truly gave me a purpose and I hope i could make your life as good as you made mine. I\u2019ll see you again one day mimzi poo. \ud83d\udc94",

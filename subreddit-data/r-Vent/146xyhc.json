I feel like there is just always something wrong with my body- i am always in pain, i am never at peace with my body and i just don't know what to\ndo anymore. i am so exhausted from constantly battling myself &amp; trying to suck it up to just get through the day. i am tired of feeling hopeless and useless.",

As in you become a person you don't recognize type of thing.\n\nAdditionally, I commend you for pushing through. Every time you go through something like that and endure the pain, you're strengthening your tolerance to the BS that life brings. I respect you for your resilience and hope you keep holding on because at the end although I don't guarantee any perfect end result, you will be a stronger person for it.",

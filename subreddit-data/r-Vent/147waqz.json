    "postText": "My spouse and I are separated at the moment. We\u2019re trying to make it work, but as it stands right now we\u2019re glorified roommates. Sleeping separately, minimal to no contact, we don\u2019t really talk or even hang out much anymore. I miss being able to hold her, rub her legs and back, playing with her hair, all of that. I would honestly give years off my life to be able to hold her hand again. I\u2019m trying to be respectful of her boundaries in regards to the separation while we try to get ourselves together, but it\u2019s really fucking me up. It\u2019s been almost a year since we separated and with my love language being physical touch and quality time my mental has begun to take a nosedive. I just feel so alone and unloved and want to cry all the fucking time. All while battling with my brain to stop trying to fuck things up with intrusive thoughts so that we can get back to normal. \n\nMy well is running dry and with no way to replenish it I fear it\u2019s gonna become more and more difficult for us to reconcile and it scares the shit out of me. I\u2019m just so fucking tired, man.",

I\u2019ve been trying to work on everything she had issues with but it even when things are going okay she still keeps her distance and makes me feel like no matter what I do it\u2019s going to be like this forever and everything is pointless.",

I wish we had the time to do marriage counseling cause I can only imagine it would do wonders at best, give us something to work towards with obtainable goals at a minimum. It absolutely does wreck me. It\u2019s so hard being around her and her having what feels like indifference towards me. I just want my best friend back. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear that though, I can\u2019t imagine how hard that was on you.",

I never fully dove in because my husband flipped shortly after stringing me. But maybe worth looking at something like that? I mean...I guess I was desperate and these programs prey on that but I thought anything was worth it.",

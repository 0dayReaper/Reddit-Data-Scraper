    "postText": "While I still struggle on what to say and am awkward, I still feel more welcomed and opened to conversations bc the folks were just nice, willing to speak with me and we had some things in common. I had 5 minute conversation with a mother and daughter cosplaying. Granted, while was talking to people at the event,  I found it hard to ask for their socials but I eventually got a few.\n\nWhereas at work, we're doing a mandatory Field Trip as the manager put it  \"You'll be forced to have fun!\ud83d\ude42\" and I'm dreading wasting time around them. Cohort of 60+ people who meet up every so often for the past year and I still don't feel comfortable talking with them. It's even harder now as most have groups going on. \n\nWhen I walk in and instantly feel self conscious bc I hear them make comments on my face, and my mannerism. I overheard someone say they hate me bc I \"ruin the vibe\" as I walked out the room that stuck with me throughout the day. As someone who really hates gossip,  backbiting and nitpicking at people I don't understand how someone can say that about a person they don't know.\n\nI want to continue exploring more hobbies and getting to meet ppl who my interests. Does anyone else feel this way?",

    "postText": "Since march I\u2019ve been dealing with obsessive stalking and harassment from one neighbor. Tried getting a restraining order, they favored it in hers because her rich ass mummy lied her ass off in court and won. Ok whatever, don\u2019t care as long as the druggie leaves me the hell alone! Fast forward to now with continued stalking and harassment, I\u2019ve finally met a couple of friends who have clout too. They\u2019ve given me loads of information such as; her mummy sleeps with the mayor of our county. Go figure! Not only if she a major liar and super rich, she\u2019s also a sl{}t\u2026.apparently, my friends and I bail my apartment for a day (for my sanity!). Well apparently I get a text today from my other neighbor, basically threatening if my friends don\u2019t leave, our landlord manager will be getting a call. I tell her to stop threatening me, and that she\u2019s just mad because she didn\u2019t bother to ask my friends if they could move out from in front of her door. She says it wouldn\u2019t be her making the call, itd be druggies mummy doing. Ok whatever. Well we get to a store because I need to use the restroom! I guess as we pulled in to the store they were loading druggie neighbor up in an ambulance. Cop stops us and asked if we knew she would be there. I told the officer no we didn\u2019t know she would be here we just stopped because I needed to use the bathroom really badly!!! She comes out of the ambulance as the cop says we can go in and ACCUSES ME OF BREAKING INTO HER UPSTAIRS APARTMENT (IM IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HAVE BEEN THE LAST TWO YEARS!!!!) I blow my lid at this!!! I said back \u201cNO I HAVENT BROKEN INTO YOUR F&amp;)$ING HOME YOU CRAZY ASS PSYCHOTIC BITCH!!!!\u201d The cops shouted at me to go inside. Fast forward, we are all piling into the car. Cop stops us again. Says my friends vehicle was spotted at the apartment complex and supposedly isn\u2019t allowed to be there! I tell the cop I am in the process of adding them to my lease. He lets us go. Fast forward to when we get back to the apartment. They go upstairs to druggie lunatic place because they were getting gas money from someone. They come down and inform me that lunatic has been starving an old man. I gather some food and have them tAke to the old man. My next door neighbor started accusing me of doing drugs!!! I flip out again, we have a scream match. She\u2019s threatening to call the head executive of the housing authority and drug enforcement officers on me and my apartment, I told her fine crazy old bitch do it!!! None of us are on drugs!!! She threatens her son knows a judge and I\u2019m upsetting her, I said so? What\u2019s the judge going to do? Arrest me for being a neighbor with friends!!??? Like are you f@)&amp;)&amp; serious?!?! I\u2019m like your upsetting me!!! I told her to delete my number and to never text me again! I blocked her number. She told me to stay far away from them, all I ever done was try and help them!!!! I even gave them a whole unopened gallon of milk!!!! Well the control freak called the cops. They didn\u2019t say anything to me or even knock on my door\u2026. Shit is a f$&amp;)fest of drama all the time anymore because my neighbors can\u2019t stay out of my business!!!! They do not pay any of my rent!!!! They need to keep to themselves and stay the hell out of my business!!!!! Ffs \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i hate it here, and I absolutely hate my neighbors!!!! I want to move, so badly, I just can\u2019t afford it.",

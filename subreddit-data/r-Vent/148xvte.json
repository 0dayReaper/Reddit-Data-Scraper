    "postText": "tw for homophobia, internalized homophobia, all the shit that comes w/ that\n\nI'm honestly so annoyed and upset right now- I doubt I'm gonna make sense and I'll probably delete this later.  \n\nMy older brother (23M) and I (21F) were playing a game online together with his boyfriend (23M?) and our sister. We were using the typing chat so there was no indication of tone or whatever. \n\nNow this part is gonna sound bad, but this is just his sense of humor and isn't what pissed him off. It's just kinda a lead up to the event? Basically he made a joke like \"well i do really like balls\", yknow- gay joke lol. I private message him and I say \"bro i wish i could call you a slur right about now\", and he replies \"do it you coward\" WHICH DISCLAIMER I DIDNT DO IT- again this is an unfortunate lead up and has absolutely nothing to do w the pissed off part other than context skskdmn\n\nSo then he says something like \"really? during PRIDE MONTH? isn't that sacrilege?\" and then I forget to put on the private messaging and say \"I DONT WANNA HEAR IT EX- (insert famous conservative homophobic person) STAN.\" which once I send it, I'm like \"awe shit. oh well, whatever.\" and I get back a message like \"SHUTTHREFUCKUPDND\" .....anddddd instead of shutting the fuck up I thought \"lol\" and said \"get off private messaging coward\" as like a parallel to what he said earlier. \n\nAnywho we keep playing and eventually I go offline to play something else, and while I'm changing games I check my phone (which is on silent because it's like 10pm) and I have THREE texts in a row \"SHUT THE FUCK UP\" \"I AM FUCKING SERIOUS\" \"That shit wasn\u2019t funny, it wasn\u2019t cute, and if you ever do something like that again I will NEVER forgive you\" which immediately makes my stomach sink but also pisses me off??\n\nFor backstory (probably should've led with this part honestly but I don't want to rewrite/reformat) my brother was a shitty person growing up. ESPECIALLY when I was in middle school. Im still not all the way convinced that he isn't faking his whole personality now? I genuinely thought he was a sociopath. That's a topic for another vent though, the main part is- he used to be MEGA SUPER homophobic and transphobic, he would say slurs openly and was a fan of multiple conservatives and would cite them often to like argue with me- who was a middle schooler at the time. \n\nI've been questioning my whole identity since around that time, and BECAUSE OF HIM I still don't feel safe to explore any of it despite knowing he's fine with it now, and that the rest of my family has always been pretty cool with it. Because of his attitude I'm still afraid to be myself in real life or even come out as being mildly interested in the same sex. I know older brothers are always mean to their younger sisters, but growing up it felt like he found the one thing that would affect me for the rest of my life and just like.... really went with it. \n\nIt was an accident that I revealed that he was a fan of this one REALLY specific person that his boyfriend may not even recognize the name of, but still- it's not like I was digging up his far distant childhood past trying to get his boyfriend to be pissed at him. He was still like this up until like... two years ago maybe? \n\nI KNOW I should've been more careful and it could mess with their relationship or whatever, but a part of me is pissed that he's mad about me revealing his OWN past behavior??\n\nI think Im also resentful over the fact he just... got to stop being shitty and get a boyfriend and be all happy and whatever, while I still have to deal with all the things he put in my head when I was just 12 or 13. I didn't mean to bring it up in front of his boyfriend, but I didn't think it would be a big deal after the fact because it WAS him- it's not like I lied, and it WAS in the past. But his immediate reaction of saying \"it wasn't funny and it wasn't cute\" just REALLY pisses me off. Especially the cute part, since it's so infantilizing.\n\nI don't know why Im so angry over this, I want to feel bad or like apologize, but knowing his past actions it's so hard to feel bad for him. Again there's so much background information missing from this, I don't know if I could ever explain it all since this was years of experiences. \n\nI might be coming off as a total asshole who can't move on and be happy for people. And I probably do just need to get over myself, but Im just... ugh. Why can't things just be simple?\n\nAlso throwing this on at the end, this kind of boundary was never set either. I didnt know it would be such a big reaction from him, I thought he was gonna be like \"shut up we don't talk about that lol\" but he was actually SO angry about it- which feels left field from him",

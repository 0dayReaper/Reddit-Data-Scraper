    "postText": "(although, in high school you can fight and return in a few weeks).\n\nI reported a coworker to HR for the way she approached me last week. She was loud, pointing her finger and standing over me. The office feels like the cafeteria in high school where everyone has something to say and wants to know more. Someone said something along the line of \u201cI wish it didn\u2019t go as far as HR\u201d. Another said I should have told my supervisor what I needed. Even though my supervisor knew about every negative interaction with this coworker. \n\nWtf was I supposed to do?? I know I did the right thing. But it feels like I \u201csnitched\u201d to HR and I was wrong to do so. I\u2019m already struggling with my work load but now I have to be uncomfortable because the coworker did that AND face judgement for reporting it. My supervisor asked me to understand her better and not take it personally etc etc. Her choice and behavior is inexcusable idc!!! \n\nI\u2019m so fucking irritated with it all!! I don\u2019t even want to go to work and I feel so embarrassed for feeling that way.",

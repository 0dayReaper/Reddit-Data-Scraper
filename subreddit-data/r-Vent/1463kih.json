    "postText": "I genuinely can't stop myself from feeling worthless simply due to people that have seriously hurt me in the past being successful or retaining any level of friendship when I struggle with even beating the trauma that they caused.  I feel like I'm such a bitter and jaded person now simply because i can't stop obsessing over the thought that people who have done bad things to me are able to succeed and maintain large social circles in ways that I can't. It's not even like I don't have friends, I have a really strong circle of close friends that really value me and its not that I'm unable to see that because I appreciate them more than any other people I've met, which is why I find it so hard to deal with obsessing over things like Instagram followers and feeling like people are actively choosing them over me even though I know that people don't work in binary like that. \n\nIdk, sometimes the trauma just feels inescapable and ican't imagine a life in which I'm not feeling so worthless based on insignificant things that if I were to stop thinking about wouldn't even affect me",

But comparing our lives to theirs won't help you at all. And honestly, do you really know where they are in life based on social media? Most people play up their lives there.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m gonna preface this by coming out; im trans, FtM. My grandparents are conservative, far right, christian, homophobes, transphobes, and have forced me to go to church since I was a child. They are encouraging my smaller cousins, both male, 4 and 6, in r@pe culture. They allow them to touch women without consent, even encourage it. I fucking hate it. My grandpa, who I used to think of as a damn hero, plays FOX news on high volume, despite my asking him to at least turn it down (I have very sensitive hearing and can hear everything that they are saying on it, it\u2019s fucking disgusting.) My grandma pressures me to let others touch me, and makes me feel extremely unsafe. Neither of them support my wanting to become a therapist in the future. Hell, my grandma said my favourite colour couldn\u2019t be red because she didn\u2019t like it. Whenever I tell them things, they blow it out of proportion. \n\nMy friends, on the other hand, are fucking amazing. They accept me. Damn, the fact that that\u2019s a thing that could even be debated shows how fucked up society is. They agree with me. We all have problems, but we help each other to solve them or comfort each other through them. One has BPD, so friendships are iffy, but we fucking accommodate it. None of our parents/guardians give a flying shit. We respect boundaries, we support each other, we respect everyone, they\u2019re both the best friends I could ask for. Sadly, we haven\u2019t had any contact over summer VC so far, but I still think about them a lot, now being with my family far too much for my liking. But my grandparents just fucking hate them. They refuse to use eithers preferred names (I came up with an excuse, no outing people duh).   \nI think my grandparents have a hunch that im lgbtq. but damn, I just want out. I just wanna get the fuck out of this house. I don\u2019t want to keep being dragged to church. I want to take my friends and we can all run away together and get an apartment and maybe a fish. We\u2018ll go to Canada and get out. We can finally be happy. I\u2019ll study psychology and give both of them free therapy. Spended will start a twitch channel and get a viewing. Axel will start a YouTube channel and get paid. We will make it. But none of us are old enough yet. We need to grow faster. We need to all get out. We don\u2019t feel safe where we are, and that\u2019s not fucking normal nor alright. We can be okay! But not here. Not here we can\u2019t be. Spencer will recover. Axel will recover. I will recover. We will heal. Maybe not together, but we WILL heal. We will exist in peace, finally. Once we get away from here, we will be safe. Gods, I hope we\u2019re all safe. Axel will hug someone, maybe. Spencer will find a good boyfriend to live with after we all go our separate ways. I\u2019ll settle in and find a job, possibly even get a cat. BUT WE NEED TO GET OUT FIRST. \n\nwe aren\u2019t in immediate danger. We could be, if we stay here too long. None of us are safe at our homes, at school, anywhere, just because we are in the lgbt+ community. That\u2019s fucked up. But we can make it. If we just manage to make it through middle school, then high school, all together, if we can manage to not lose too much of ourselves or more than we already have, we can exist nicely. Just. Exist. In peace. That\u2019s all we want. What I don\u2019t want is to be here.   \n\\-Max",

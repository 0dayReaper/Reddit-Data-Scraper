    "postText": "I have some pretty bad self deprecation issues. Way back in middle school when people would tease me and make fun of me (which wasn\u2019t even that happen) I coped by joining in and also making fun of myself, and that made them like me I guess? Anyways I feel like since then I\u2019ve had a bad relationship with self deprecation and I still struggle with it this day. Throughout the day I\u2019ll think back to social situations and whenever I think of something that I deemed as cringe that I did I beat myself up over it. I get pretty angry myself and think things like \u201cI hate myself\u201d or even things like \u201cjust fucking kill me\u201d and variations of that. I\u2019ve been thinking of getting some therapy this summer, I probably will because this is annoying. Also by beating myself up I\u2019m being pathetic (which is ironic because that statement is also beating myself up). I don\u2019t want to feel like a victim all the time because I bully myself. Idk lol. It\u2019s really late but I just needed to get this out.",

    "postText": "There is this person I used to work with that always got everything I wanted. \nFrom getting the promotion I worked hard to try and get on her first week when she wasn't even qualified to the next 3 promotions. She brought her own house. And now with her loving partner she is having a baby. \n\nSomething I nearly had but lost. \nI don't want to compare myself to that person's life. But it's hard when everything I've ever wanted seems to have come so much easier for her.",

Point being, good things happen when you least expect it. I went through a terrible break up, lost everything i had planned with her, a year went by; I ended up moving and meeting the love of my life. Keep hold of the positives and more will come. I\u2019m sorry you are having a hard time currently. Sending good vibes",

            "comment": "life is long.  concentrate on yourself and work hard and you will slowly move towards your goals.  be smart, put yourself in places that value your contribution and make you feel a bit more fulfilled.  dont assume the superficial image of somebodies life says anything about how they are fulfilled and what their private life is.  if you spend your life looking at what he next person has, or their luck, then you will be miserable.  most people live this miserable life, including me at times.  if thats what you want, then continue.  If you want to live a full, hard, but inspiring life - then stop worrying about her.  she ahs the job, the house, the man, the kids.  everything right?  ok, so just concentrate on fulfilling those dreams for you.  she isn't the only one that has it, but she is the only one that you are focusing on.",

I am 18m who\u2019s finally going to college lol\n\n\n2am thoughts got the worst of me so here I am making this. \n\n\nI was always considering taking the easy way out a few years ago. I don\u2019t know what or how I came out of that hole but I did. and now that i\u2019ve graduated and am finally realizing my whole life is about to change I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t.  \n\nI get the whole cliche thing of life will get better everyone has their bad days but man it sure doesn\u2019t seem like it. I do like to think I am mentally in a better space than before. but I feel i\u2019ve matured just a wee bit since those years have gone by but I still can\u2019t wrap around why I wanted to do it so bad and why I couldn\u2019t. I guess maybe it was the I have my whole life ahead of me or people will miss you. \n\nnow, since i\u2019ve last had serious thoughts about taking the easy way out, I haven\u2019t had a serious thought ab it since. and it\u2019s also been a while since i\u2019ve had these deep deep deep thoughts about all of this. so i\u2019m scrambling here realizing that what i\u2019ve done till this point in my life is completely pointless and would rather be dead. I\u2019m going to a college I do not want to go to and am going to have to do something I seriously do not want to do for another four years. \n\nlast thing that j think will explain a lot of this is that back in middle school so 6th-8th grade I think I was majorly depressed which continued all the way to my junior year of high school. I can\u2019t even explain it all it made no sense to me.  \n\nif I could just get some input or just thoughts on why, it\u2019ll be fantastic",

Your life is about to completely change, sure, but why is that a bad thing? You have every possible choice at the palm of your hands, it just takes action and planning. Dont hold your head so low, enjoy the summer and look forward. If you need to talk about anything i volunteer, i know its lonely. I know regret crushes your soul but you must remember that pain is an inevitability, and it can be a choice whether to suffer, or not.",

But the best moments ive had in my life in the past 3 years have been beautiful, and the best part is that all of those experiences were things i chose to do, and worked towards, if something ever goes wrong, then its just a set back. But as many bad things that\u2019ll happen to you because of your choices, the same amount of good things can come from them if you just react appropriately, and keep some composure. Its not easy, it probably never will be, but there are many many moments that make all of it worth while",

            "comment": "This is gonna be long, soz - TLDR my life has been crappy but here I am!\n\nI tried and failed to take my own life at 16. At 19 I had a series of surgeries that went catastrophically wrong and left me disabled by 20. By 21 I decided that what was the point? I couldn't live a normal life now.\n\nI was in university studying because I couldn't work and my options from my parents were go back to education or be homeless. I went back to education.\n\nI had the chance to volunteer abroad for a month in the job I thought I wanted to work in. I fucking hated it. I planned on finishing my month, coming home and being done. Then after a week it all changed. I still hated being where I was but the people I worked with were so nice. They made in a year what would be an average monthly paycheck here, but on my birthday they bought me 3 cakes cause they didn't know which flavour I liked, sang me happy birthday in 3 different languages! They did more for my birthday than my parents had ever done.\n\nAnd I thought fuck man, I've been so busy wallowing in my self pity that I'm missing all the good in life! It didn't get immediately better but I did make the conscious decision to try to see the good in things.\n\n21-23 I had a boyfriend who abused the knowledge I was just coming to terms with being disabled. He financially, emotionally and sexually abused me for 2 years. I left that relationship and decided that yeah, I was still gonna see the good in life but I wasn't gonna keep taking shit.\n\nAt 24 I met A, he was ruthlessly honest, funny and kind. I got a diagnosis for my condition, got offered a place on a specialist treatment course. I left my crappy job and started an entirely new career making more money than I ever had.\n\nI'm now 28. Me and A are engaged, we bought a house 2 years ago and in December last year we had our first baby! Still disabled, still struggle with my mental health, life's not perfect by any stretch but I'm happier than I've ever been.\n\nI didn't believe my life would get better at 21, I didn't stay on the promise of a happier future. I stayed because 3 men who didn't know me, who asked nothing of me, pooled their wages to make sure I had the best birthday. I thought if I can do that for someone else one day then it's all been worth something.\n\nIf you have other options, don't go to the college, don't do the course you don't want to. Even if you take a year working so that you can have a think about what you do want. I regret studying what I did, I haven't pursued a career even remotely similar and I wish I could study again now I know what I want to do with my life but I can't afford it. Don't force yourself to do something you're already regretting",

I wake up feeling depressed thinking it\u2019ll be easier to just not wake up again.\n\nBut then I think there are still some joys in life - the park, my cats, my close friends. If I don\u2019t wake up I won\u2019t get the chance to see them again.\n\nNot sure about your situation, but thinking about the tomorrow and future scares me or makes me nervous. I don\u2019t want to do this meeting. I don\u2019t want to work. But doing the meeting/work isn\u2019t actually that bad. It\u2019s the assumption and overthinking that is. I recommend meditating or focusing on the present.\n\nAlso I read something that stayed with me. Taking the easy way out doesn\u2019t meant you won\u2019t face any problems, it means you won\u2019t get any opportunity to do better.\n\nYou have oppportunities, take your time and find what you like. You have nothing to lose",

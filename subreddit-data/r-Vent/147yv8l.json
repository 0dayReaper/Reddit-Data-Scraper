    "postText": "so i get a huge amount of anxiety when it comes to getting on buses. i\u2019m from the UK and i\u2019m a 17F, and i don\u2019t know why. the whole process stresses me out, paying, what to say, getting off. i managed it the other day with a couple of mates heading to our friend\u2019s for the weekend and now he\u2019s like \u201cwe can go on buses together now\u201d but he\u2019s really experienced at it. it makes me feel like shit because now i\u2019ve done it once i feel like he no longer understands how terrifying it is. he was very very understanding before and he still is, it just now feels as though he thinks it\u2019s suddenly very easy. it\u2019s really stressing me out and it makes me feel like crap that i can\u2019t get on a bus because they\u2019re so simple. any tips?",

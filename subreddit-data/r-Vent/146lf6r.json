    "postText": "i\u2019m 15 and my brother is 17. he recently graduated from high school and i wasn\u2019t able to attend his grad ceremony. \n\nfor context i recently had spinal fusion surgery, which was a very difficult procedure for me. there were times i was barely able to move, and i got to points of passing out due to the pain. it was a lot for me to go through and the whole process was extremely difficult and traumatic. i struggled to eat, sleep, move, and even stand after the surgery. \n\nmy brothers ceremony was 2 weeks after my surgery when i was still recovering and wasn\u2019t able to attend school yet. i decided to not go to the ceremony because my parents and agreed it would be very hard for me to sit through the entire ceremony, as i hadn\u2019t really gone more than 30 minutes without having to lay down. they recorded him walking the stage for me so i could still watch from home. \n\nnow i am doing a lot better but i can\u2019t stop feeling so much guilt for missing such an important part of his life. i just wish i had sucked it up and supported him at his ceremony. last year i graduated 9th grade (the end of middle school in canada), and he came to that and supported me. i won this small award for art and he was so happy for me and i just wish i was there to cheer for him like he did for me. \n\nlast night i went to this little get together to celebrate my brother and his friends graduating, and i overheard him talking to one of his friends about how i didn\u2019t go to his ceremony and that i wasn\u2019t even busy on the evening. \n\ni completely broke down when i got home, i honestly feel like such an asshole and i don\u2019t know what to say to him or how i can ever make up for this. i feel overwhelmingly guilty and if anyone has any advice on what i should say to him please let me know",

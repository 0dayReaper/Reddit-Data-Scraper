    "postText": "\nI don\u2019t know, I just want a break. This school year was really hard for me, and I almost killed myself because of it. So, I figured I\u2019d take the summer off to just relax since my life has been pretty hectic for the past couple years. My mum wants me to do this Khan Academy stuff for at least 1-2 hours a day for the entire summer, I know that\u2019s not that bad but like, I was excited to just have a big break to let my mental health get better. I also feel like this wouldn\u2019t help a lot to be honest, I have a lot of trouble with remembering stuff I\u2019ve learned (especially math which is what my mum wants me to study.). I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll give it a shot but I\u2019m gonna wait until maybe the end or middle of July to let myself rest. Also maybe my ADHD would probably get easily overwhelmed by this.\n\nBut also another problem with this is that I really wanted to get a kitten since unfortunately my cat that\u2019s been with me since day 1 passed away and I wanted something to help cope with that, and also I just felt it would be important for my mental health. A kitten would help a lot, but my mother is using my past grades and the fact I\u2019m not immediately starting this school shit as an excuse to not get me one. She also says that if my grades next year aren\u2019t good then she wont get me a cat (if we don\u2019t adopt a cat by then.) and I just feel that\u2019s kinda, stupid? Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m just being desperate or impatient but refusing to get your child something they could definitely take care of and would help them a lot just because of some letters is rather shitty to me.",

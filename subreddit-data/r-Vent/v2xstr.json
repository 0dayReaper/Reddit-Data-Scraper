    "postText": "Look.. I\u2019m a gun toting red-white-and blue bleeding conservative. I believe in smaller government, less government over-reach, teaching people self governance and less taxes. I am a veteran of oif and oef and believe in the idea that the constitution set I stone for our country. \n\nMy nephew came out as transgender and wants to be referred to as a female, she is biologically male. I broke down. And not because I\u2019m against it.. I broke down because I believe in the idea of freedom. To live your life the way you see fit as long as you don\u2019t do damage to anyone else.\n\nI\u2019ve never put too much thought into it. I might even not agree with it. But does that matter? If you believe in freedom, your beliefs fall to the wayside. I completely support my nephew. It\u2019s going to be a hard life for her. But I would gladly and willingly pick up my rifle in defense of her. Fuck your religion or your pre-conceived ideas. Let her live the way she wants to, or deal with me. \n\nThat\u2019s my vent, thanks for listening.",

I personally think that if she was comfortable enough to come out to you despite your politics then you must be doing something right. For future reference though you can call her your 'niece' lol.",

I generally hate democrats outside a couple as I am a socialist, but I can respect the genuinely principled libertarians, especially since they oppose the worst parts of the far right, I\u2019ve also seen some conservatives say blue dog democrats are better than libertarians, and that libertarians cost them the election lol. Which is exactly what Hilary supporters said about \u201cBernie bros\u201d for voting third party. \n\nMakes you wonder what the political landscape in the US would be like if we had a proper electoral system that didn\u2019t make it impossible to have multiple parties, our current one just leads to a weird hyper partisan and messy system, in most countries you wouldn\u2019t have Bernie and Biden in the same party, or Justin Amash as a republican (albeit he did eventually leave the party, it was the end of his career by doing so) \n\nMost people just check an R or D, something I like about local races near me is you have to better research candidates to know where they land, and I do vote third party where viable. So I do understand some of the libertarians, although GOP is getting pretty extreme while Dems aren\u2019t even where they were under FDR, they\u2019re still the Bill Clinton Reagan hybrid type that lacks a spine and are whores for corporations, outside a handful",

They'd still be my friends.\" We need more people like that, at the very least",

You may not feel the same way about all of us in the community, and that is okay.

Of course there's opinion on the internet, but not ***everything*** is opinion on here. There's fact, you just need to look for it. I've spent 30 years fighting and educating, and I'm tired of it.

To educate you on all the obstacles we've had to claw ourselves over? Especially when, as I said, Google is free. \n\nClaiming you live with two gay people in order to make yourself seem like an ally is deflective, and tells me you don't really care. You shouldn't get to hide behind the fact that you live with two gay people. That's extremely problematic.\n\nWhat makes me feel unequal is the fact that I've had the right to marry for less than seven years. And I have to worry about that right being taken away if Roe v. Wade is repealed. Same-sex marriage and RvW were both passed citing the 14th amendment. If one goes, the other is soon to follow. To this day, it's still legal in some states for landlords and people who are selling their homes to deny me housing, just for being gay. There are still no explicit state-wide laws protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment in 28 US states. This is only a very small portion of why I feel so slighted, so unequal, as a gay man in America. If I were to type all my thoughts, we'd end up with a 6-book series.\n\nThe inclusion of your gender and saying there's no way you'd understand because you're a woman was completely unnecessary. I'm sure you wouldn't be able to understand as a man, either.\n\nThe penis size insult is a bit old and dated, much like your musty, dusty attitude. It got old, quick.

Don't let people convince you you need to be hateful to be conservative. Also don't let people reduce the world to two binary sets of ideas, political parties aren't everything and they're actually not as homogeneous as some people like to believe. There are different leftists and different conservatives, because everybody's values and priorities vary in subtle ways, even though they'll end up agreeing more with one or the other party for very different reasons.\n\nYou don't need to be \"better\" since you haven't been hateful...? Of course, always try to be better because that's what we should all do to be the best version of ourselves, but fr I see nothing wrong with your pov, with the way you treat your niece, or with you simultaneously identifying as conservative.

That is the right thing to do regardless of politics or culture. But I am almost just as serious that the fact you got to that point only because of your niece is a character flaw and I will not pull punches with you or anyone on things like this.  \n  \nI would want to point out something that I think you need to consider: you and I can have a civil conversation and be polite and act cordial while we discuss these issues as if we're at a tea party. But in the end, if enough people are anti-trans, they basically get to choose for people, like your niece, how she will live her life.  \n  \nCivility is a political luxury that the non-oppressed have because they are not endanger of being dehumanized, losing their rights, or in the case of a lot of trans people like your niece, outright murdered.  It's like with non-violence and civil rights. The oppressed, even when acting non-violent and civilly, are risking their lives for things you take for granted. Thus, why I will not, for your niece's sake or my own, pull punches for anyone, you included.  \n  \nThe fact that a stranger on the internet who doesn't know your niece was already in her corner before you had your personal trip to Damascus is something you need to reflect on, and yes, be ashamed. Not as as political issue, but a moral one. Even a conservative should be able to \"love their neighbor as themselves\" let alone a flesh and blood niece. Do better.",

Stop and ask if what you believe is making a world a better place. The answer is clearly no.",

America is a first past the post system which means with near mathematical certainty that OP is stuck with a two party political system.\n\nWhile I agree that human beings are nuanced and different and amazing unique moral snowflakes, the political reality is this: in any policy decision making position that matters, 9 times out of 10, you're either going to have a D or an R next to your name. Those are not broad strokes. Those are simply facts. One can dislike those facts and want them to change, but that is where we are.\n\nThat's the reality of the political system we are discussing. Not saying I like it, not saying there shouldn't be more successful parties to reflect the broad spectrum of opinions. I personally hate both parties as I am far far \"left\" of the Dems. But that is just the truth. His choices, for better or worse, are the party that wants to regulate trans-people and the one that doesn't. Up until his niece came out to him, he was, and who knows maybe still is, on the wrong side of the issue/history. \n\nJust like Dick Cheney and his daughter, OP's morality and politics shifted a bit the minute it impacted his family. But why does OP need a relative to empathize? It's ridiculous. But yes, let's reward every conservative who decides to do the bare minimum that one human being can do for another and empathize. It's silly.\n\nAlso, I have no problem being compared to the Clintons if the alternative is the likes of, I don't know, David Duke and Richard Spencer. One is a corrupt set of politicians (but aren't they all?) while the others are actual Nazis and Klansmen. It's just not the same level of moral culpability and giving OP credit for doing the bare minimum is why we have a problem with right wing extremism in the first place.",

We should start blaming violent shows(Hollywood has been glorifying violence since its inception), video games(I\u2019m a gamer btw), social media, the internet, and music. \n\nYou wont solve anything by banning everything even guns. Those that want to cause harm will do so with or without guns. \n\nPoliticians know this and they also know how\nto minimize it yet banning guns sells a lot more than actually fixing the problem because it creates controversy and fear, politicians thrive on controversy and fear. \n\nWhy not make it easier for people to get mental health treatment, why not universal healthcare, or fix up the communities and create more jobs and free or affordable higher education? Hell throw UBI in there and make more laws that protect the employee as well as raise the minimum wage across the country because even $15 an hour isn\u2019t enough anymore or fix our work culture thats become a lot more pro corporation. \n\nPeople always compare the US and its right to bear arms to other countries equivalent of the Second Amendment (mainly European countries) and they think its because of the laws that are in place. \n\nbut no it doesn\u2019t have to do anything with their laws but the fact that they have a better quality of life and thats something they don\u2019t talk about even the media.\n\nNow notice how I mentioned that politicians know how to minimize it, even with the solutions I just mentioned it wont end mass shootings. The only way to fix this problem is for parents to start being involved with their children, to actually love them and to teach them about respect. All of the mass shooters have had abusive and shitty parents. A kid wont commit horrible atrocities for being too loved. A lot of people today shouldnt be parents in the first place, we have parents that neglect their children for tiktok. The real effort to combating mass shootings can only come from\nthe parents. \n\nStop being a sheep and quit parroting none sense because its hip and trendy to do so.",

That\u2019s pretty cool you told me\u201d, and unfolded into me hugging this beautiful child and me in tears. I\u2019m fearful for her because I know what the suicide statistics are.

It's wilful ignorance.\n\nNot to rub it in or anything but I'm glad you're seeing the light.\n\nThink about it for a moment, people believe in freedoms, but only when they are your freedoms. It's hypocrisy.\n\nThe laws and rules you're voting on don't even have anything to do with your problems directly. You're voting about problems that other people have. You're trying to make decisions for other people, outbof fear maybe it will have some indirect effect on you. \n\nWe have the whole republican base worried about what some kid in Florida does with their genitals and its some outrage. Those people probably don't even have one gay friend, let alone know jack shit about what's going on nor have any business deciding what freedoms that kid has. \n\nConservatives are folks who have a bubble around them and if anyone infringes on that bubble, it's a problem. But it's not a problem when their bubble infringes on others.\n\nThis is called a privilege, to have so few problems your biggest political points are what OTHER PEOPLE do or do not do.\n\nThis post is just a gripe in general, but I think if more of them had nephews like yours, they would see their beliefs don't actually hold water in the real world, only the world they are trying to create.",

    "postText": "I came from a very sheltered household but then I moved out for university and I had these great experiences and made memories. For the first time in my life I could say that I was actually happy, in every sense of the word. I had a strong party and academic balance and people loved me, I felt loved for the first time too. \nI met a lot of horrible people at university too tho. One of my guy friends physically assaulted me and got away with it, none of the professors helped me press charges infact some of them actually took his side. They said I must have provoked him. That left a scar on me emotionally.\nMy issues with trusting men got worse.\n\nThen I met this one guy with the kindest eyes and the sweetest heart. Let\u2019s call him Adam. He strung me along for months, I wrote poems about him and then he said he wasn\u2019t ready. I understood, then he stated to talk shit about me to everyone we were mutual friends with.\nIt shouldn\u2019t hurt this much, I\u2019ve been through so much worse but for some reason this is impacting me. \nI met horrible people at uni and I feel like im loosing the happiness that I finally felt. \nIm loosing all the good traits of myself that Adam pretended to once love. \nI don\u2019t wanna do that.",

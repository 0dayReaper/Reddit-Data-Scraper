    "postText": "I knew it was coming when I woke up this morning. I saw all the signs. I couldn't find her, and my parents were awake and talking, my mom looked completely distraught. \nI heard them say, \"How do we break the news?\", and then I went to summer school. \nI knew it was coming, when I got home and into my room and my dad opened the door. I asked, \" Was it Izzy?\", and then I knew for sure.\n\nShe's gone. Her loud annoying barks are gone. Her adorable little face is gone. Her little hops are gone. I will never be able to see her walk around with her dingle berries hanging by a single hair again. \n\nShe's been in my life since I was one years old, I have been with her, she has been with me for so long. A whole 15/16 years. \n\nShe passed peacefully in her sleep. And she can now be a dingle berry up in doggy heaven, barking with every other dog to have existed. I didn't get to say goodbye, and that's what hurts most. \n\nIzzy, if you are out there, I hope you somehow manage to read english, and read this comment. I love you with all my heart, and while I knew this day was coming, I wish I was able to hold you one more time and give you a big Mac. I will always miss your little mustache face, your goofy little walk, and your prehistoricness.\n\nI love you, Izzy. \n6/13/23",

My best friend. She passed away in 2016 but I still miss her and think about her all the time. I\u2019ll tell you though..oh my worst days when I\u2019m just upset about anything I find her hair on me. And she did not shed. Ever. I moved out of my house 4 years ago, got new clothes\u2026and I\u2019ll look down and her hair will be right where I can see it. And it\u2019s her distinct hair. They are never too far away \ud83d\udc9c",

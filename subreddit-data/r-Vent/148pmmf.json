    "postText": "I\u2019m trying so hard to get my life together. I have been struggling for awhile. Both mentally, emotionally, and at my job. \n\nI will have completed my masters degree at the end of the fall semester, this year. I am reapplying for another bachelors, and starting those classes in the fall too.\n\nBut I finally got another interview for the job I went to school for. Finally! After five years! And the interviewer kept doing things like literally cleaning his ears out, on camera. Telling me to think like Winnie the Pooh, \u201creal hard.\u201d Or \u201csmile more\u201d.  Or pushing me to answer in ways that didn\u2019t feel right. They wanted me to have open availability. Even on call at nights. (Which is fine. But, at what point does a job take presidency over your down time?)\n\nRight now, I work for Amazon, in the warehouse. And although they are paying for my second bachelors in the fall; the pay and job is stressful. I\u2019m familiar to working. I completed 60+ credits while working 40-100 hour workweeks. But for once, I thought I would have a chance. At least something livable. (I know I am not owed anything, or promised tomorrow.) But I want to help my parents be able to retire, and go on vacations. \n\n\nI just feel so defeated.",

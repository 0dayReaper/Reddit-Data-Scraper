I thought she liked me back like she texted me everyday and tries to call me all the time and jokes about us having sex. I admitted my feelings and she doesn't like me. I've liked nobody at all besides her this entire year. I've compared every girl I've ever met to her and not once has someone been better than her she's just perfect. I ve walked her home from school we've called all night texted all night and she doesn't like me. what do I actually do I cannot get over her she's literally amazing. I have no idea what to with my life anymore she was my motivation to actually take care of myself and get up in the morning. She was the best part of my day and now it means literally nothing. surely if you do all this with someone from the opposite gender you like them or have I just been led on??? I don't know. All I know is that I don't want to wake up in the morning",

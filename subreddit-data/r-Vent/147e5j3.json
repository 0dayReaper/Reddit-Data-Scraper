    "postText": "I graduated in 2018 with a bachelors in international business, but towards the end of my college courses, I felt that this degree would be useless. It turned out that I was correct, and I could not land a corporate job. fast forward to today and I am attempting summer classes to get prerequisites for dental or nursing school and it is difficult. I\u2019m taking anatomy and physics right now and I feel like an idiot. I do not know what I\u2019m doing with my life and I am 28 years old. Never had a girlfriend, i\u2019ve only had my job for the past 2.5 years because it was my family business, and I\u2019m unsatisfied with not being an expert in a field. I\u2019m scared of the future.",

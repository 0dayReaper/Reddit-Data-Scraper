If a child is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at school that is reprehensible. Be grateful he got flagged at all for feeling unwell and that someone took notice. Now the school is aware of his situation and he has an extra set of eyes on him, and hopefully access to counseling, which he needs on a professional level regardless. However, anyone \n\u2018tore\u2019 into him needs to be mindful of their personal lives, even if he was high, that\u2019s no way to treat a human being, let alone a child. I get how teachers and staff can let their emotions and outdated stances get the better of them, but I hope this gave them a wake-up call about what\u2019s truly important, mental health.",

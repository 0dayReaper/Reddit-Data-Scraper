I know why I feel like shit. \n\nI don't think I'm supposed to feel body pain. Not yet, anyways. I just turned seventeen, and my joints and mainly my legs just. ache. More like burn? But it's managable, I just need to find a way to manage it better. But I guess pain travels because I can feel it in my right arm, back, and neck for some reason. Usually when I'm feeling leg pain I pace but honestly I feel to sick and dizzy to even do that. \n\nIt's just stress. I know it's stress. Y'know living with ADHD can be hell. I can't stop procrastinating, which is causing stress, which is probably causing pain. Hell, if I stand to pace now my legs might give out on me. Jesus. ",

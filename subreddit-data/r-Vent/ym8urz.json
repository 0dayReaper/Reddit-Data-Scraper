Including the people that have their life together and seems like they'd *NEVER* touch drugs. Then they show up on the news and it's a shock to everyone",

They can have seizures and heart attacks and many other aliments if they go through a withdrawal. That\u2019s why quiting cold turkey on certain drugs is dangerous. Weed is medicinal. Opioids are dangerous and alcohol is way worse the weed lol. \n\nWeaning someone off meth opioids or any form of hard chemical substance drugs is a very long process. \n\nSo honestly you could be saving them from a bad withdrawal that could kill them especially if they are living on the streets and going through a withdrawal. \n\nYou can do some more research if you\u2019d like. \n\nBut yeah I give money to anyone in need. Or I have bottles of water in my car or I will go get them food. \n\nSomething is better then nothing. \n\nI used to save my old purses and fill them with  essentials for women\u2019s needs. Tissues, sanitizer, menstrual products, Qtips, travel size toothpaste and tooth brush etc. and if I saw someone I would pull over and give them a purse. \n\nYou can do this with old backpacks. If you really don\u2019t want to give homeless spare change maybe slowly build up bags or purses for them  to hand them instead \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJust think outside the box.\n\nOr help by donating to local shelters and work at one. Then maybe see what homeless really do with there time and money. Not all homeless people have substance abuse issues. \ud83d\ude44",

So I am willing to accept your advice until you are proven wrong (if you are). Likewise, I know how to take a homeless, broken spirited and finincially ruined person and lift them up so the can help themselves. So they can regain thier independance, dignity and financial stabilty. \n\nSo I stand by my original statement that \"blindly giving, more often than not, does more harm than good\".",

My bad on that.\n\nMy point is i think that just giving people money is very shallow and people use it as a way to be able to pat themselves on the back as if they actually contributed to their lives at all.\n\nAlso many of these people that beg for money arent homeless. Some places are different though. So someone from Philly might not understand that the homeless there are MUCH different to the \"homeless\" where i'm from. Some are geuinely homeless but people around here are known to scam people by begging.",

It really is cheap and I bet that we're not the only one who got begged by them so they have the right amount to buy it. So I prefer giving food and drinks than to give money.",

Who knows if more people took upon an act of giving it forward, we all would be in receiving mode.. and to blame government as I can see and yeah not a fan of in aspects lol, government is upheld by people too.

Getting an apartment for yourself only with normal conditions is expensive for someone who earns a minimum considering essential needs, therefore, you can get a 1 room apartment that is shared with another person or many. It's better than being homeless at least. Almost all governments have a money support program that you can sign up for and receive about 200-1000 bucks depending on your living conditions. You will suffer for a year or more but at least not for your whole life. If you want to help a homeless person, then give them food and donate to homeless facilities instead of handing your money to them directly. At least it would be much more effective in actually addressing the problem instead of digging their grave deeper and building a community that can support them.",

I asked what food he would buy, he said a Pizza Sub, and a 2 litre Pepsi. \n\nI went in and bought him exactly what he said. When I came outside, I handed him the bag of food and drink. He took the pizza sub and throw it at the back of head, saying he wanted money \u201cto buy it himself\u201d. \n\nAfter that, I don\u2019t really help the homeless as much.

We get a call that 3 kids were trying to steal something from a Bar that\u2019s attached to a certain part of campus. \n\nWell, they managed to steal a fully sealed, brand new bottle of vodka. They ran off to the local university gym, and each drank a 3rd. They were ten year old kids. \n\nOne got so fucked up he started smashing his head into the concrete walls, one, I don\u2019t know if she had seizures, or just blacked out, or what, but she was not in good shape, and the last one, kept punching himself in the face saying \u201cthis is all my fault, I killed her, I killed her\u201d. By the time police got there, his face was swollen and bleeding nonstop. \n\nUnfortunately, I have no idea what happened to those kids, if they survived or anything.

Management let him do that because people rarely used the outdoor tables. Even if it was raining cats and dogs he would stay outside because he didn\u2019t \u201cknew customers wouldn\u2019t like it\u201d if he was inside where it was dry or cool. We had plenty of nice fellows who would buy him some food. But we also had several others who came in just to complain that his presence was unsightly or that they weren\u2019t going to eat here because he might attack them. Hell one time he came in to use the restroom and a couple of teenage girls walked by and stole money he had hidden under a rock for safety (our one nice manager chased after them but he was overweight with bad knees so money was lost) yet despite it all overwhelming ngl majority of folks I worked with on my shifts were so weird about showing this guy basic kindness like if I gave him a few bucks they basically said if thrown that money in a trash can since it\u2019d be burned on beer. If I bought him food when I finished my shift and chatted with him for a few minutes before I headed home they\u2019re would be a few who\u2019d go around acting like he was my boyfriend or something. \n\nLike dudes, it\u2019s called showing someone basic respect and kindness. Is it that hard for you to comprehend?\n\nIdk what happened to him, summer ended I went back to college. Came back for winter and he was gone.",

We never asked people for money but that didn't stop them from judging us. We had the cops called on us just for parking the car to try to get some sleep. We parked in the driveway of a home my family owns and there's an awful neighbor. She did a lot of hurtful things but the worst was making fun of the way my partner, who was recovering from a stroke, walked and talked. She would scream \"Maybe if you had a job when you were younger you wouldn't be like this now!\" He's a 20-year navy veteran, but she assumed he was a drunk or drug addicted deadbeat because we were homeless. We were homeless because we got kicked out of our apartment for being unable to pay the rising cost of rent. Now we are still homeless but he had to go back in the hospital because of other health issues and I'm staying with that same family living next door to that bitch. We're waiting on a VA housing voucher to help us pay rent so we can have an apartment again. Don't assume everyone who is homeless is there because they are a druggie or a drunk. We are people too, deserving of the same courtesy and respect you would give another person who wasn't homeless.",

            "comment": "Until you see addiction, you won\u2019t get why giving them money hurts \u2014 not helps. I use to work in a neighborhood that was very populated with addicts due to many public rehab centers being stationed on the same block. Addiction is a very nasty beast. I\u2019ve seen so many addicts steal and sell things that retail for like $20 for like a $1-$5. Why? Because the money adds up. \n\n\nIf you ever pay a visit to NYC, visit Harlem specifically W125th &amp; Lenox.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add \u2014 it\u2019s not expected that you pay their rehab fees. You can always recommend them to public rehab centers or call a nearby one and ask how you can navigate directing someone to a rehab center. If you can spots the signs of addiction, give people food or  toiletries or blankets. Not every homeless person is automatically an addict but I never could tell until I worked in that particular neighborhood. If you can see the signs, don\u2019t give them money \u2014 give them toiletries, blankets, food, and directions to the nearest PUBLIC city/state run rehab center. That\u2019s just my opinion \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I\u2019m not gonna make a person experiencing homelessness tell me what else I can give them other than cash just to avoid encouraging an unproven addiction. And as for panhandlers who are fakes, they\u2019ll get theirs, but I\u2019d rather give a little to a fake or an addict than right off an entire population because \u201cit encourages bad behavior\u201d. If you\u2019re so against giving those experiencing homelessness money, then don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t care about your half involved arguments unless you are boots on the ground actively homing, counseling, or actively involved with this community. Otherwise get out of here with your poverty porn ideas of a hair cut and one hot meal in a day.",

As a citizen of the US you should be focused on contributing to your society\u2019s progression, not it\u2019s demise.

It makes you a poor example of what \u201cgood\u201d actually is. I wouldn\u2019t want my children to model themselves after you. Pretty sad that you need to put poison in your body and make yourself stupid and numb in order to deal with every day life.

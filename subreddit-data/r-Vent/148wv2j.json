    "postText": "I feel embarrassed. I asked a guy I was talking to if driving thirty min. every time to see me was too much, since he works 11 hour days constantly. I wasn't sure if it would be a deal breaker for him. Now I just feel embarrassed because I'm worried that he thinks I'm stupid for thinking that. I think it's relationship anxiety from the past when I had a boyfriend that made me feel stupid for every little thing I did. I really like him too, which makes me feel even more nervous. I think I'm having a panic attack tbh.",

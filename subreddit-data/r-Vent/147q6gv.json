    "postText": "For a year I had trouble swallowing didn\u2019t have the means to get an endoscopy done until a month ago and for the first time I was able to eat with ease after I had my esophagus dilated. (an endoscopy is when a gastroenterologist puts a camera down your throat and in your stomach to see if there\u2019s anything wrong) \n\nThen I was put on a medication called omeprazole which is supposed to limit the amount stomach acid your stomach can produce. \n\nHowever, I think I had a severe allergic reaction to it because my throat started to burn 24/7. Didn\u2019t matter what I ate. (And I\u2019ve severely limited my diet through this month to 80% vegetables and fruits) \n\nThis past week I\u2019ve had difficulty swallowing again! I stopped taking omeprazole because the burning throat was just one of the many horrible things happening to my body while on it. \n\nMy body is feeling better but the only thing that is still happening is the difficulty swallowing. \n\nIt\u2019s been getting worse since I stopped. I haven\u2019t had solid food in 3 days. \n\nI\u2019m seeing a new GI because my current gastro just ignored my horrible symptoms and tried to up my dose\u2026 I refused. I think that upping my dose would\u2019ve killed me. \n\n\nI\u2019m past my limits. I\u2019m so hungry too. My mental health has been in the trash for a while. \nI\u2019m just scared of what\u2019s happening to me.",

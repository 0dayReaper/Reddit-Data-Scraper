    "postText": "Living in america is exhausting and draining. You hear about assistance programs and people receiving miracle help, but what do you do when you don't qualify for anything, and are told theres no help for you, or that you'd get more assistance if you got pregnant. I'm still fighting for disability after 8 years of being told I'm too young or not disabled enough for Social Security. I am not even functioning mentally or physically anymore, I've lost all my hobbies and interests due to physical inability or being mentally incapable, and the career I worked so hard for and went into so much stupid school debt for is just flushed down the drain. It all means nothing for me. My partner works his butt off full time without vacation or pto just for his check to disappear into bills, the mortgage and the car payment. We don't go out, we don't spend money on things aside from bills and cheap basic household necessities. We can't even afford to get an oil change or maintenance for the car to make sure it stays functioning for at least as long as the loan is. I can't remember the last time either of us were able to get something we just wanted or enjoyed and not absolutely needed. I'm tired and traumatized by the messed up systems that exist in our Healthcare and goverment. Partner is tired and can't even see a doctor to get mental health assistance and gets treated like a pos deadbeat paycheck by his ex who still makes it a point to verbally a*use him any chance she gets after she stole from him and took off to the other side of the country with their kid. We don't even have the money to sort his taxes out or work with child support. Especially with just one income for two people, sure let us just pull it out of our butts while we're at it. \n\nThere's no help or lifelines and we are just so exhausted. This world sucks.",

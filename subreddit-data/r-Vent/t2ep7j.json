    "postText": "You will bully me, you will downvote me, you will report me ,but I just basically don't give a single shit at this point. I may be emotional and say a lot of stupid things right now, but here it goes. \n\nLet me just say I'm absolutely 100% against the war, I'm on the side of people, it's a magor tragedy and I still can't believe it's happening. I don't support Putin, frankly, I don't support any country in this conflict, because it's every country's fault. \n\n(This text is not addressed to all redditors. You'll know if it's addressed to you or not. It will find it's receiver.) \nBut that's not why I'm here. I'm here because I'm fucking sick of you. I'm sick of your fucking games, I'm sick of your speech, I'm sick of your comments \"Fuck Russia\" \"Finally Ukrainians killed another Russian soldier\". I'm sick of your trust in news. You basically believe anything that's anti-russian at this point, you don't double check. You know why? Because it's anti-russian! Why would they need to desinform me? But they do. And they do it a lot. But if some pro-russian news pop up, it's propaganda and you need the source, or double-triple check (Russia desinforms too, my point is you double check only those, whose opinion you don't like) . But most of all I'm sick of your peacekeeper games, \"StOP thE WaR! ItS inHUmAne\". I'm not saying that's a bad position, no. It's a good position, and I support you. BUT WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU ALL THESE EIGHT LONG YEARS? WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU ALL WHEN PEOPLE GOT SNIPED AND KILLED ON MAIDAN? WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU WHEN ARMED SOLDIERS STOPPED BUSSES WITH FLEEING REFUGEES AND BEAT THEM UP HUH? WHERE THE FUCK WAS YOUR ANTI WAR SPIRIT WHEN PEOPLE GOT KILLED IN DONBAS FOR EIGHT YEARS? WHERE THE FUCK WAS YOUR HELP WHEN PRESIDENT POROSHENKO SAID: \"We will have a job - they do not. We will have pensions - they don't. We will have support for people - children and pensioners - but they don't. Our children will go to schools and kindergartens, and they will sit in their basements. Because they can't do anything! This is how, this is how we will win this war.\" ABOUT DONBAS AND IT'S PEOPLE?!?! \n\nImagine if Putin said that. Just imagine what would happen to your minds. You'd be screaming and screeching. Every little fucking snail will have an opinion about this. \nBut why didn't you screech then? Answer me. Why? I know why. Because now, politics is a trend for you. You do it because it's a trend, it's like a sort of a game to you all. You didn't dig into this topic then, that's why your knowledge consists of mainly things, they told you now. That's why to you this war started because Putin is a power hungry maniac, not because of a complex and multilayered geopolitical situation between eastern and western blocks. \nThat's why to you, Zelensky is a white angel with golden wings, who bravely goes to the frontlines to his soldiers and asks evil Putin to stop the war, not a president who not only ignored all Russias offers to stop the war in Donbas, but mocked Russian government for even suggesting such a thing. \nI'm not writing a fairy tale here, these are all facts.\n \nYou are all fucking hypocrites, you care, when it's a trend to care, not when people are in need of care. Because they were, they were in need of care for eight fucking years. You were silent. You were busy doing things that matter to YOU. \nYou know who actually cares? The fucking sides. US(not United States). Ukrainians and Russians. When YOU people claim Russians as war criminals, Putins dogs, maniacs, barbarians, when you cheer for burned corpses of my people, how do you think we feel? We feel relieved and good, that finally we got what we deserved?(they got what they deserved if Ukrainians) Ritorical question. NO WE FUCKING DON'T. WE SUFFER, EVERY DAY AND NIGHT WE CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU ARE JUST SPILL GAS ALL OVER THIS FIRE. \nLet me tell you a secret. Half of what you believe is happening is a lie. Because you don't do anything to double check or research something on your own. Because you started to receive information at the peak of the information war.\nPlease, I'm begging you, start thinking for yourselves, research, observe, analyze. \nIf you don't want to do that, just don't do politics, you are just causing more pain and misinformation\n\nPeace\n\nEdit: Please don't make this about me, think of people I am talking about and people who are truly suffering.",

I've been around long enough to know there's always two sides, and I've been eager to hear some real talk from a Russian.\n\nI agree with you: people follow trends.\n\nCan I ask: If this was really about freeing Donbas, why go for the capital and attempt a siege from 3 sides? Why Snake Island? You do see how this appears to be an overreaction even when we take everything you said as truth, right?",

                            "comment": "If you do not happen to be aware, the Russian government relies very heavily on natural gas sales to Europe. Something alone the lines of 1/3rd of the government's revenue is from natural gas.\n\nBefore Crimea was annexed, prospectors discovered massive natural gas deposits across what used to be Ukraine's exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea. This puts Russia's revenue at huge risk. That's why Putin wanted Crimea. The only problem is that Ukraine, justifiably unhappy with Russia's agression, decided to cut off Crimea from the freshwater supply on the mainland. This is causing the island (which technically isn't an island) to become dryer and dryer as the years go on. In order to solve this problem, Russia has to take more territory from Ukraine.\n\nAnother reason for invading is geography and how geography has given Russia a poor hand when it comes to its own security. From Eastern Germany to the Ural Mountains, there is only flat, hard to defend plains. This makes it very easy to invade Russia, provided the invading army is properly prepared for winter and/or can capitulate the government before winter comes. To combat this, Russia has to take over as much of these plains as possible and shrink the amount of land Russia has to defend from NATO, who most state officials believe are enemies to the country.",

I can differentiate between you and the leaders, but this doesn't change the facts that my grandfather and my relatives could die, they are now with very little fuel and can't even drive around. And food is starting to become scarce. \n\nI wanted to send money to them but they said that banks would not let them get it anyway. The anti-war protests are cool and all, but facts are facts. Russia invaded Ukraine. There is no way around it. \n\nAnd i understand your rage. I too am booking with hatred and rage, seeing an already struggling country being destroyed by fucking Russians. And whatever happens, you know how much time it will take to rebuild everything? And how much money? Ukraine was already in a shitty position economically speaking, so much that I had to emigrate to find work elsewhere and support my family that stayed there. Now everything is getting destroyed, and it will be even worse. We will need a lot of aid from other countries to rebuild the state, this assuming that we will actually hold.\n\nBut at the same time I am proud of my brothers. Ukraine has been filled with fascists and all kind of scum since a long time, but even normal people are showing a kind of bravery and pride that I would have never expected. Not a single men that I know fleed the country. Right now they are making molotovs in my uncle appartment. \n\nSo yeah, I guess we are all victims. But right now Russians are destroying my homeland, whatever is the reason. Funny thing, my grandfather is way more logical on this, saying that he understands that these Russians soldiers do not want to be there. \n\nAnd yet I can't stop boiling with rage. I am now in a safe EU country, but if I was in Ukraine, I would fight 100%. Perhaps I would just die from a random bullet, but I would try to wound the Russians as much as possible",

NATO is a global superpower and they are expanding to the east, to the borders of Russia. If you see it on the map, belarus is already surrounded by NATO, if Ukraine joined NATO, it would be a disaster. Because we couldn't defend such a long front. That's why he had to ensure that Ukraine doesn't join NATO (which they wanted to do for a long time now.) \nThe event catalyst I believe is Zelensky expressing total disagreement with Minsk agreements,  bombardment of Donbas, even though Russia officaly  recognized as legitimate states and expressing his desire to abandon the treaty on the destruction of Ukraine's nuclear weapons which was signed in 1990's\nThat's what I think, there a many more theories for example Putin wants Ukrainian gas",

I also get that people should have spoken up earlier.\nHOWEVER, they should have spoken up in favour of Ukraine when Russia annexed a part of their country. They should have spoken up against Russian propaganda fomenting sedition in Luhansk and Donetsk and using it to prop up a completely made up genocide when the last genocide that occurred on Ukrainian soil was the Holodomor, and remember who that was perpetrated against? Yeah, so does the Ukrainian people. Sure, Ukraine is not blameless, but the regime (incidentally, pro-Russian regime) that attacked its own people in Ukraine has been gone for a good long while now, this country has stood free for close to a decade. Well, the part that was not invaded by Russia anyway.\nSo yes, we should have spoken out long ago, and I'm not gonna say \"Fuck Russia\" because no, Russia is not at fault here, but I am gonna say \"Fuck Putin\" who, as an ageing dictator, has decided it was time to accelerate his efforts to rebuild the USSR and under the pretence of rooting out nazis and stopping a genocide (which, according to him, was taking place in the east of Ukraine) is gonna annex a whole fucking country while hiding it from his own people.

Putin is the one in control, Russian residents are suffering his decisions as well. It is apparent that many russian residents are outside protesting against the war and being taken under arrest because of it.  \n\nDonbas situation is one where Ukranian people got hurt as well. No matter who the aggressor was, it was the Ukranians who got the bitter end of it. \n\nYou also said that the West is bringing attention to it, which is true, however, it is not abnormal to do so after many Ukranian people have lost their HOMES, their PEACE, their JOBS, their REGULAR, MUNDANE, OH SO SWEET DAILY ROUTINES, and most importantly, their LIVES and their FAMILY AND FRIENDS. \n\nAt the end of the day, whoever at fault is, the war is happening in Ukraine. not in Russia, not in the USA, not in the countries from which we write these comments and prayers, but Ukraine. \n\nPolitics is never 100% right and most of the times, politicians do things and decide what benefits them, however, Ukranian people are the casualties of a war that has nothing to do with them. \n\nI am writing this from Croatia. We were at war with Serbia some 25-30 years ago where we wanted our freedom and our own functioning country... Many people (including myself) lost family members to that war. When the whole world realized what had been happening and how certain wrong information had been put out to mask the true meaning of the war, the war was pretty much over and we created the basis for our country nowadays. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that in every war, regular, everyday people are casualties and there is nothing we can do to change that, but let's not act like this war is something mild and peaceful. \n\nI do not pray for Ukranian people because I hate Russia, I pray for them because I understand what they are going through and I would not want that to happen to my worst enemy. \n\nPeople, stay safe out there, it is a wild world...",

His strategy of brutal crackdowns only works if the protests don\u2019t grow out of control, and the conditions for such a critical mass are better now than ever. Once the fear-based control structure starts to crack, there is no going back for Putin, especially with massive pressure from a failing military campaign and economic isolation. Remember, the current consequences for protesting will only hold as long as Putin maintains his total control of the police and military, and if the protests do succeed in toppling him, all the jailed protestors will soon be freed from whatever inhumane mental torture prison they\u2019d been carted off to. And yes, some people will die, but that will be the price of lasting progress.",

You\u2019re a moron if you think the West has not cared about Putin\u2019s long list of crimes before now. You are clearly totally ignorant about the nuances of geopolitical posturing and appeasement, and the context of the political policies and decisions from various Western countries leading up to this. Just because you\u2019ve only been exposed to significant news coverage of the U.S. election interference and some netflix documentaries, it doesn\u2019t mean that Putin\u2019s imperialism and consolidation of power have not been very alarming to us for many years. The fact that you also deny that Putin is a tyrant and that his regime is a police state exposes how woefully uninformed you are about what has been going down in Russia for over a decade. You have zero place telling me to educate myself when you sound like a mouth-breathing dunce who gets all their news from Tucker Carlson. Also, what is this fallacious nonsense argument that Putin is somehow not a tyrant because he \u201cis not Stalin\u201d? You ought to feel ashamed for downplaying tyranny in such a manner, and I urge you to pull your head out of ass and read a wikipedia article or two for a change.",

Honestly i hate americans more than russians :D (no hard feelings).

They learned nothing from the treaty of Versailles and Germany. \nIf you look at a map at where nato is and where Russian border is Ukraine is right there in the middle. Putin was right, if Ukraine joins nato it will end in nuclear war. \nI do not support Russia govt in this because they are wrong, however the only solution was to move nato troops back. It\u2019s that simple, we\u2019re they going to do it, no. Should they have? Idk. Once you move that close as an aggressor you can\u2019t give up an inch. Putin would\u2019ve taken it just as a precaution. \n\nHowever, Putin did make the case that he took it because he thought Lenin giving it up in the first place was wrong for the empire. That is taking that agreement out of context. \n\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with you, they are all hypocrites.\n\nChina made the only good point frankly, when it\u2019s israel it\u2019s peach keeping, US democracy, Russia invasion. Ukrainian President wants this brought up in the international justice court and they should. And if all of the countries have the right mind they will point out all of the wars the US has been apart of because how can you possibly keep international treaties and law going if you aren\u2019t consistent. \n\nI\u2019ve heard conflicting reports about how hard they have attacked the city. I personally believe that if Russia really wanted Ukraine this would\u2019ve been over before Ukraine could\u2019ve even gotten help. \n\nWorst case scenario we go to nuclear war, middle ground Putin is ousted and Russia is divided up and China gets a piece of it which would be bad geopolitically, having only two super powers is bad. Cold War proved it. \n\nBest case scenario, we get a huge reset on foreign policy and a true resolution in the Middle East from this and Israel is called out on their bs. Same with China they did it in Hong Kong, Tibet and are eyeing Taiwan as we speak.\n\nI hope Ukrainians and Russians are well. This was unnecessary blood shed. But if greatest heads prevail we can all avert nuclear war and we can finally fix the US imperialism. Because if US goes full on fascist tomorrow there is no coming back. We are going to be looking at Russia to help save us all.",

Sadly, back then, I was too young to understand what went on between Russia and the Ukraine regarding the Donbas region - I was around nine or ten years old or so (I believe, I don't know in which year this whole conflict started). Now that I'm older, I did some research and I came to find out for myself - everyone is at fault. There's no good guy. There's only bad guys. NATO promised Russia *in writing* that they wouldn't expand any more after accepting Germany - my country - and yet they did it anyway. There's now Bulgaria as well, or Romania for example. They broke their promise. Russia is defending itself now, because if NATO would've accepted the Ukraine as well, there'd be weapons directed at you all from all kinds of directions. You'd basically be screwed. Yet the way Putin is handling this is a bit too much in my eyes as well, to be honest. This war could've been avoided if only he would've approached the situation differently. Though who am I to think this would ever happen? I heard that he reelected himself as president and rigged it so that he'll stay until 2036 or so.\n\nWe humans really don't do the world a favor by existing. Honestly, it's about time all of humanity kicks the bucket.",

Aber im Moment superm\u00fcde. \n\nAlso wie ich das damals mitbekommen habe war der jugoslavienkrig so ne Sache wo sich NATO und Russland opportunistisch eingemischt hat. Aber der Umgang ist eher dass Russland teile erobert und dass die Nato ein B\u00fcndnisse ist in das L\u00e4nder freiwillig eintreten. Wichtiger find ich auch eher die Tatsache dass sich unter russischer Regierung die menschenrechtlichen zustande verschlechtern und das ist so ein Ding wo ich mir denk naja. Man kann schon behaupten, dass das Auftreten der NATO im Kosovo-Krieg Putins Paranoia gesch\u00fcrt hat aber,das ganzen Unternehmungen Gebiete zu destabilisieren, sich in w\u00e4hlen anderer L\u00e4nder einzumischen, die Allgemeinbev\u00f6lkerung zu infiltrieren. Das ist mehr als Verteidigung. \n\nEs ist jetzt auch nicht das erste Mal dass jemand einen Eroberungskrieg als Verteidigungskrieg darstellt(llww). Das ist halt auch meistens die Rethorik. Ablesen kann man das am ehesten find ich in dem man sieht in welchem Land der Krieg gerade stattfindet. Die Anexxierung von der Krim war ja auch angeblich von den Separatisten gewollt aber die Kultur die Russland damit ausgel\u00f6scht hat it's in ops post auch nicht so wichtig. (Das war ein der Maidenkrieg n\u00e4mlich geendet hat.)\n\nIch kenn mich auch nicht super aus aber einen Teil wei\u00df ich noch von damals als eben jugoslavien zerfallen ist (da war ich 9)",

The people, us, are the puppets which our masters pull our strings. Does anyone remember the panama papers? That should be a very huge indication of what our world leaders are up to and what all of this is really about. Sorry to make it simple stupid and anti climatic but its literally just a war of asshole rich leaders using us as their armies to make themselves bigger. We give these leaders power. So im tired of seeing people complain when they do nothing to get these insane world leaders out of power. And when i say world leaders, i mean both sides. Ukranian president is on the panana papers too. Usa leaders are just as corrupt as putin. There are no good sides. The real war which people have been ignoring  is the class war. Its always been the rich elite vs the working poor. If these amazing world leaders were so great and good. Slavery still wouldnt exist everywhere and every single one of us, funding slavery. Every phone and computer and tv is made of components that came from slavery... the chocolote we eat is made from slavery. \n\nhttps://www.thenoproject.org/slavery/cocoa-slavery/\n\n The info is out there and you cant really say you werent aware at this point. Many are but still nothing is done. So you all get angry because people treat war like a trend? How are you suprised when no one cared that children are being trafficked all around the world? Which we also found out that there are world leaders involved in human trafficking. Thats why nothing is really being done to stop it. To stop any of it. Its simple... they dont care about us. They will continue to use us for their war games and we die gladly for it. They will continue to traffick us and we all keep quiet about it. Until everyone realizes just how badly things are and really want to change it, things will never get better. Every single one of our countries leaders are manipulating and gaslighting us so we continue to fight amongst ourselves as well as each other. There is so much horror in the world. We need to be upset at all of it, our leaders, and rise against them. If there ever was a time. Its now.",

The first step to us fixing all these issues is to recognize this and realize it for what it is. If you truly want to help ukraine and your country and the rest of the world. This is how you do it.

Putin is the one to blame, not the entirety of Russia.\n\nI don't hate the Russian citizens, I don't cheer for the death of soldiers or people on either side. I wish people wouldn't make jokes about this shit. Its not funny. People are dying and this is a serious issue. The news isn't reliable, Russian citizens aren't the enemy and shouldn't be treated as if they're all evil.\n\nI'm sorry, but the US shouldn't be sticking their nose in and potentially making things worse like the US likes to do.\n\nI know what's happening is awful. I know everyone wants to help Ukraine because of what's in the news. But the US getting involved never seems to really help anything and I'm tired of the US sending its people to die when they don't need to.\n\nNews in the US is biased because the government wants the citizens to demand we help out Ukraine, but what happens if Putin decides to escalate the situation and attack the US too? Not only would that fuel the anti-Russian bs, but the US would escalate things even more at that point. It would get so much worse. And people can say \"Putin won't attack the US!\" But no one knows that for sure. \n\nPeople should be thinking about this more. People should be researching further than their local news source. You can't rely on the news in the US to be telling you the entire truth.\n\n(These are just my thoughts, I don't really care to argue about them so please don't bother trying to.)",

But what I hope and what I want doesn't matter, realistically. \n\nI can hope the US won't make things worse by sending troops to help, but I also can't rule out the possibility of it making things worse for everyone involved.

Look it up, read about it, ask Russians, it was horrible. We were sold to the West for McDonald's and bubble gum. West wants Russia not to protect people, but for our resources, which we have a lot.",

            "comment": "A few things to consider : \n\n1) there is always geopolitical conflict all over the world \n\n2) when there is emerging war it will obtain much more attention \n\n3) when conflict effects a nations interest it becomes much more prevalent to that nation \n\n4) if a nation is undergoing conflicts of its own it is foolish to think the masses will focus on conflict elsewhere. \n\n\nI think your anger is misdirected. How can you blame the masses for not being political gurus. How can you blame people for not focusing on conflict between distant nations when they have their own conflicts as well as daily struggles. You are greatly overestimating the human capacity. Your resentment should remain with the media machine and how they present information. ON BOTH ENDS. Your resentment should remain with ongoing geopolitical conflict everywhere. Your resentment should remain with yourself for contributing to the bullshit. If you want change you need to bring attention to the facts, educate people, shed meaningful insight and let them make decisions for themselves. You act like people are obligated to give a shit about your fucked up country. People love a good underdog story. And the fact is this is an underdog story. All of this attention is a good opportunity to bring up important argument points. Help educate people instead of expecting them to care about your views. You just sound like a dick. Most people aren\u2019t poly sci experts nor are they historians and many trust the media unfortunately. You have unrealistic expectations of the general public. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the Ukraine. I\u2019m sorry for the general Russian populous. But your behavior doesn\u2019t help anything. Stop complaining and be proactive if you want change. \n\nThe reality is this could spiral and effect the entire global population and people are scared. If they don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s happening they will pick a side because it\u2019s comforting. \n\nBeing proactive is much more meaningful and effective than complaining. This applies to all avenues of life.",

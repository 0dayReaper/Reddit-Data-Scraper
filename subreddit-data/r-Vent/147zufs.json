I can't find any job that makes me happy or at least content and I'm so fucking miserable and done. I just wanna cry my eyes out right now I'm so tired of having to work and do things I don't want to do but I can't quit because then I'll have to suffer more until my two weeks is up and my parents will be pissed at me and I won't have another job to go to and I'm literally just so fucking done I don't wanna go in tomorrow",

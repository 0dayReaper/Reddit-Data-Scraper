    "postText": "Just feeling extra lonely lately. I'm very antisocial and anxious so I have a real hard time making friends irl and sometimes even online. I feel like I'm bothering them when I message them, especially when they don't reply so I usually end up waiting until they talk to me. I know that's not great and I will hype myself up to send the first text but it's very disheartening when I get no response lol. I have 2 irl friends and they both live hours away from me with busy schedules. We don't even talk much anymore. It's very hard to make friends at work since the environment is more of, \"Just do your work and don't talk to anyone.\" Everyone is nice, but also, I'm the youngest person there by at least 15 years or more. So that makes it worse. And I live in a super small town and there's not really any place to meet people aside from maybe like, a bar and bars aren't really my scene. \n\nThe only person I have is my spouse who I love very much and I'm very greatful for them but sometimes... I just wanna have more friends too. I'm jealous of him that he gets on discord and plays games with his friends every night for hours. And yea, I can tell him I'd like to spend time with him and he would gladly turn it all off and spend time with me, but I don't wanna ask that of him. I know what it's like to not be able to have fun with all your friends when they're all having a great time. \n\nIdk not really a big deal I guess. I hate to be that person but it's been like this for a long time and I guess I'm used to it but it still sucks",

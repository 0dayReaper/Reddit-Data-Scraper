    "postText": "But im just do tired of the sex jokes. My bf and I don't sleep together. I made rules and conditions that have to be met before we do(im still a virgin). But everytime we meet its always a sex joke. Hes great every other way. Doesn't rly pressure me to have sex but the sex jokes are just constant. I love him alot but the sex jokes just make me think of my ex who cheated on me because I told him up front I would have sex with him. I just want one day where hes not trying to grab my boob or something. Like cant we watch a movie without that. I just wanna watch scream without u putting. A hand in my shirt or something like that. Ik im probably just over reacting ro this stuff with my depression acting up for dumb shit but I rly just wanna watch the damn movie",

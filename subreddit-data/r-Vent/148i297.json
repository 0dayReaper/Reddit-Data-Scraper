    "postText": "TW- SA? I think it counts?\n\nSince primary school I've never been able to maintain a friendship with someone, I was astronomically disliked. No one ever gave me a reason why, told my why they disliked me they just made it clear they didnt. I had two friends in primary school, one left at the end of a year and the other went to a different highschool and I've never seen her again. \n\nHighschool wasn't that much better, I managed to make a few friends but after a while I realised they weren't actually my friends. (TW- SA??) I was sat next to my best friend and this older boy who wouldn't leave me alone in the theatre on a school trip kept touching me and I begged for her help or for her to get a teacher and she ignored me completely and got mad at me afterwards. My other friends would message me about having sleep overs together then a few days later they'd send pictures together at a sleepover, without me and did this with other situations as well. \n\nI'm in college now and I've managed to make a friend who is the complete opposite to me, I do like her but sometimes I don't understand her. She complains to me that she has no friends other than me but when we are sitting or walking there are many many people who walk past her and know her, she gets the bus with a group of her friends every morning as well. Recently we were sat in the corridor and two people striked up a conversation, she hadnt said two words to them, yet when we were in class those two people had messaged her and were walking past and waving at her, I got completely ignored. \n\nWhile walking out for break she saw this guy (we'll call him T) and said she doesn't want him to tag along with us yet slowed down to make eye contact with him and smile at him so he came over and tagged along, she hardly said anything to this boy but he was showing such interest in her, she was ignoring him so much to the point that me and T started talking about sharks... After he left she complained about him being there as well.\n\nMy friend likes to insult people, she'll make jokes about how they look and stuff and I'll go along with it which I know is mean. One of the people who we met in the corridor sent her a picture of himself and she laughed and turned to show me, I made a comment about him and she snapped at me saying \"what? Am I not allowed to have friends?\". She went to the bathroom so I got my things and left the lesson because idk it's just upsetting that everyone we meet wants to be her friend but she ignores them all when I try so hard and Im the one that gets ignored. I don't know what to do. I have her and my partner and that's it",

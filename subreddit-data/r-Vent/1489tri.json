    "postText": "It started in 4th grade, (I'm in 7th now) I got bullied for being fat and overweight. This really got to my head and since then I haven't been able to eat much. I've had to seek medical help multiple times because of it. It hurts to eat but it also hurts not to eat. I hate seeing myself as fat but my thoughts keep taking control. Everytime I eat something I either can't keep it down or get upset because it hurts so much. I don't know how to stop this from happening and start eating normally again.",

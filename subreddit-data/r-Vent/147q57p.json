    "postText": "Roommates are at work, friends are all many hours away, everyone who hasn\u2019t spoken to me in months wishing me happy birthday through my phone. I\u2019ve got a dog who is twice as anxious as I am and I\u2019ve got no idea how to take proper care of him. I\u2019m beyond stressed and anxious on my birthday. I want to leave here but I can\u2019t, I hate my shitty tiny apartment that I\u2019m grossly overpaying for, I hate living with my roommates(they\u2019re great people, just not for me to live with), and most of all I hate myself, because I\u2019m an idiot with no self esteem, who just can\u2019t ever do anything right. I\u2019ve got no direction, barely enough money to get by, and the strongest desire to get the fuck out of this awful city. But I\u2019m so stuck, stuck to the point where I struggle to get anything done because I can\u2019t bring myself to do any of the things I need to do, even fucking eating is hard to keep up. I can\u2019t leave because of this shit lease, it would be more expensive to break it than fucking stick out the rest of it. Not like I could afford it anyway. My car is shit, I\u2019m trying to save it for the drive out of here, but I\u2019m not confident in that, I\u2019ve got to drive 13 miles to work on the shittiest road ever. Not to mention all of my stuff that I\u2019ll have to throw away to fit my dog in there.  I\u2019ve got to work with my roommate too, because my sorry ass who can\u2019t say no to anything or anyone got him a job at the same damn place I work at.  Again he\u2019s fine but he stresses me out for no reason and I don\u2019t want to talk to him every day all day.  Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even the stuff I used to love doing. I have 0 urge to try anything new, I just want to waste away in my stupid fucking apartment that I fucking hate living in. I want to fucking give up.  I\u2019m such a fuck up and a loser. I used to wonder why no girl would want me, but I know now. Nobody wants to be with a miserable fucking loser. I hate myself and I\u2019m too much of a bitch to end it, so here I am, crying, and bitching about it on this app. On my fucking birthday, all by myself. \nIt\u2019s a pivotal year too, so it fucking sucks even more. I am so fucking sad and stuck. I hate my life so much.",

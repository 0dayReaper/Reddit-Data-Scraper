    "postText": "In the UK it's exam season and my friend is taking their GCSEs which end in less than two weeks; I do not know why they blocked me but I think that GCSEs are the reason. They will not tell me if it is or what I did and when exams are over I am unsure that they will want to remain as friends. I want to talk to them and they dont read my messages, and although I've stopped and won't try to start any more conversations, I sent a lot of messages and fear that they will be creeped out over how desperate I seem. I find it difficult to think our friendship will go anywhere good after this, which upsets me because we stopped talking for a few years after they switched schools plus covid. Then one day we started talking again and picked up where we left off and I do not want it to end. I had more friends during covid than I do now, I don't want to loose them.",

So there is absolutely nothing you can do. Maybe during these two weeks, it would be better for you to take care of yourself, and spend some time with other friends?",

What I can tell you is that it will be super difficult to get over them but after a while you'll have more time to take care of yourself and spend time with others. What I suggest is try and occupy yourself with other task. And remember to stay strong \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe",

Sometimes people shut down during stress. Maybe they know you two will go separate ways soon, and are taking the chicken way out of ending it. You never know, but people will come and go in your life. And it always hurts when they go.",

            "comment": "I think that they may have issues to deal with. It likely could be stressed and how the handle it is shutting people out or unable to communicate properly. It can be exhausting to be friends with people with those issues. I am sorry you are experiencing this. I think I\u2019d leave them be, but if they hit you up again I\u2019d communicate how it effects you and set a boundary with them that if they feel like disappearing again you\u2019d appreciate them communicating that- and then if it happens again just cut the cord on the friendship. By no means do you need to put that effort in, but you stated you don\u2019t want it to end that\u2019s my advice. \n\nI tend to shut people out too when I go through things. I have compound PTSD from trauma and so when I\u2019m in stressful situations I don\u2019t want to do anything and communicate less except with people I\u2019m closest to such as significant other and parents. But I don\u2019t block people or stop communications and let them know what\u2019s goin on. I just stop wanting to hang out until it simmers down.",

For example, had a friend that gets upset that I don't answer her texts immediately, I made it clear to this friends that I work 2 jobs but I'm off certain days so she can text me then, but she doesn't get it and continues to bitch about it  So I put her in Spam for a while, so I can choose when to engage. Perhaps I am wrong for doing it. How you are perceived by a person isn't your problem, unless you say something creepy or over message. Probably an issue that has nothing to do with you, they are dealing with a great deal of stress.",

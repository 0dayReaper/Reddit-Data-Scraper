    "postText": "Basically, my bestfriend was in a relationship for what felt like 3 years with another good friend of mine. She always struggled with Bipolar disorder or something like that. And her boyfriend was usually there for her. It wasn't always a good relationship, but I never got many details. I knew he was a great guy who would never do anything to hurt anyone. I dated this other guy for around a year and broke up because I had health issues. We finally got on talking terms again and my bestfriend and I were thriving as friends. I found out on Saturday that her and her bf broke up and told me is was a mutual break up cause of loss of connection. I supported her and comforted her as much as I could and showed her I was there for her. Then I got a thought in my head to see if her bf (my other friend) was okay, so on Sunday I asked him. He seemed confused when I asked him and when he asked what I knew, I got concerned. I pushed him to give me answers and he did. My bestfriend and my ex has sex. She cheated on my friend. He seems fine, but I know he is hurting so much now. I am absolutely furious. I promised him I wouldn't tell the friend group and that I would not yell at her, but its difficult. I yelled at my ex and got into a huge fight with him. I told him that he was a home wrecker and a disgusting person. That he was everything that was wrong with him. He ended up telling another friend in the group so at least I have him to talk about it with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's so fucking stupid, she needs professional help. She's avoiding me now because she knows I know and that I am furious at her. For good reason, I would probably scream at her if I saw her or if she approached the friend group. She hurt me knowing this exact thing has happened to me twice before. Now its three times with each of my exes. She deserved nothing and I deserve an apology. She better never come near me again. She is a very selfish person. So if you are reading this and it sounds super familiar, yea this is for you. Never come near me or the group again.",

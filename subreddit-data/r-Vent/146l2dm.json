    "postText": "I feel I need to move on, I struggle to move from the past with a certain person that made me distrust others similar to her. She harassed me a lot earlier in the school year and made fun of me because she assumed I was lesbian. I want to forgive her and the others who hurt me, but it just feels so hard to. I try to give reasons to forgive them but in my mind I feel hatred, especially for her. I want to move on and finally feel peace and freedom but my hatred for them still drags me deep with feeling of violence towards them. I want to forgive them for their ignorance and for hurting me but it\u2019s so hard, I want to go to school next year with a mind that is clear from this \u201ctrauma\u201d (idk if it\u2019s trauma since they did not hurt me that much but it effect me a lot negatively) and I need advice on how to truly forgive.",

    "postText": "When I was 9 or 10 years old, I stayed home from school because I was sick, and my mom offered to let me sleep in her bed because it was way more comfortable. Her then boyfriend (now ex) came into the room and layed on the bed and started to SA me in my sleep. A while ago, I lost my phone. Do I had to make a call on my moms phone. I saw a call to her ex that she made 4 days ago so I got curious and went through her messages with him. Turns out she still stays in contact with him and she's been hiding it from everyone. Everyone in my family (moms and dads side) hates him too. She also witnessed him sexaully harass a old women while she was with him and chose to ignore it. I'm so pissed off rn what do I do",

            "comment": "Well telling a trusted adult about the situation would be a good first step. You should not have to see your abuser. If you feel safe enough having a conversation with your mother about the events could be beneficial. If you do not feel safe not telling her is a completely fine choice. You definitely should not contact the man in anyway. In my personal experience, confronting my abuser was an emotional damaging moment. I thought it would bring me closure but it made me feel worse, by this I mean you cannot control what they say and it may be very hurtful or degrading. \nIn the end, you are a child and the adults need to protect and support you. You deserve a safe environment. None of this was your fault. Sometimes our personal devil comes out and makes us question ourselves. You know your experience and do not let anyone make you feel bad about your trauma. It happened to you not them. You are valid and I believe you.",

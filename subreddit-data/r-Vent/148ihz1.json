    "postText": "I feel like this has become a coping mechanism. Whenever I feel down, I become desperate to hangout w my friends. Or I become desperate to meet a guy. And whenever I start feeling insecure or unsettling, I shift to another guy to feel better. It's like, I constantly need someone to be there for me so that I don't feel like shit. This has become so unhealthy and idk how to stop it. I've been hooking up w this guy, fully aware of how it's just casual. I don't have feelings for him either but yesterday he kissed a girl at this party. Idky but that unsettling feeling hit me again, the same feeling of losing people. It's not like I want him to be more than what we are rn, it's just... Idk why I always feel like this. And since I was a bit anxious after this I went out w my friends and now I'm okay again. Idk how long I need to depend on people to not feel miserable about myself. I'm sick of not being able to handle my own emotions by myself. It's not like I rant to my friends or those guys, it's just their company charges my energy somehow. It all started after my previous breakup, I thought it'll get better but it's just always there. (I'm so bad at explaining sorry)",

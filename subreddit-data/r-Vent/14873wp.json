Relationships tend to be more intense once sex is involved, and it seems like you have a lot going on right now that should be addressed first.  \nMental health matters; if you're this upset because he went home after kissing and dry humping - you are going down a dangerous, *dangerous* route if you choose to go further.",

No relationship feels right until you feel right to be completely honest. It sucks, I remember being young and wanting to grow up so fast and be in love, but one needs to love themselves before they can love anyone else. The discomfort after an encounter is not normal and for me it was guilt that I was feeling, which can stem from lots of things. Being too young and knowing that is one of them. Feeling used is not okay either. Op is the only one that can figure out why they feel this way, truly though.",

It's hard to denote what loving yourself is, but just being there in the sense that you don't really think about yourself or your needs or the fact that you're a human being or living at all isn't a good healthy way to be. It's like a constant state of depersonalization is what I was experiencing. Apathy or detachment to yourself are signs of deeper mental issues. I'm not sure one could set proper boundaries in that state, but I was in a relationship when I was numb, and it struggled a lot until I started feeling better. Ofc if you are content and happy with how you feel and know how to set boundaries and communicate, I'm not sure that would pose much of an issue, because like I said self love is hard to describe. It's less that I feel love for myself like I do another person and more like I care about myself a bit and I don't let negative self talk get to me so much.",

You wanted more intimacy after you were vulnerable with your bf whereas he may not have needed/wanted as much aftercare. Both are valid approaches but can leave the one wanting more feeling bad. \n\nYou need to communicate your needs and explain to him that it\u2019s difficult for you to open up and do stuff without proper aftercare. And I think setting better boundaries in terms of what is expected is essential (as in you expected only making out but it turned into more. If that\u2019s okay with you then great, but if that made you uncomfortable then you need to let him know to take it slower or discuss how far you are willing to go beforehand itself)\n\nAs others have already suggested you shouldn\u2019t do more stuff because you feel obligated or while you are feeling conflicted. It\u2019s just going to make you feel worse and perhaps make you resent him. \n\nMy suggestion is that if he needs to go by some time then you guys should plan to do stuff with plenty of buffer time left for aftercare",

She absolutely can! What is it with men thinking that WE need to take care of their sex drive? You have two hands. She can get up and leave whenever she wants! And it was be wanting more, leaving satisfied. As long as she leaves WITHOUT OUT PTSD! Your hormones are you problem and your problem only! THIS IS PROOF MEN ARE SO TWISTED THAT THEY LITERALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSENT IS!! \nIf it's s not an Enthusiastic \"YES!!!!!\" ITS \"NO!!!\" Being forceful and demanding causes fear! When they say no once, 15 times, 6 times or 1,658 times... \"NO!\" A complete sentence. \nJust because a woman was okay with making out and over the pants mouth stuff; doesn't mean she's down to do anal! It. Certainly doesn't mean soaking either! And it's DEFINITELY not Derping, and ABSOLUTELY NOT JUMP SOAKING!!! \n\nI agree with the rest of it. Set a boundary. Have open communicstion! I know it's hard and it feels a little cringy but it's honestly worth it!! When you aren't trying to read each other's minds, you can explore your bodies together!!! this is literally foreplay! Then when it's over, you will be so worn out (of done. Correctly) standing isn't even an option, neither is speaking English for a minute. Then you get very tired! If you aren't tired, wait a minute are. Start again! \u2757\u2757\u2757GET ON BIRTH CONTROL AND ALWAYS WEAR A CONDOM \u2757\u2757\u2757and find different things! Take your time. Communicate!\n\nI am a Dom... So I am incredibly comfortable with my sexuality. And I think everyone should be. Because you push the body to extreme levels of pleasure... And it's so good, that by the time you get on top of him (women, this is the best way to make it hit all the right place, just squeeze your plevic muscles for as long as you can! You will have a big o before he's even in all the way! And that kind of orgasm is felt in ever inch of your body! Sec is fun!!! I'm a Dom because I was raped too many times. So, I can't risk letting anyone on top of me. It causes night terrors. I have always taken control. My ex's weren't special in bed! I AM JUST GOOD IN BED!!! lol so get good In bed, men will like whatever you do!  And when your muscles constrict.... Lol it's a wrap for them! \n\nFind your sexuality and have fun!  \n TL;DR\n\u26a7\ufe0f \u2757\u2757\u2757 THE GOLDEN. RULE \u2757\u2757\u2757\u26a7\ufe0f\n\u2728\ud83c\udf1f\"NO!\" Is a complete SENTENCE!!  \ud83c\udf1f\u2728\n\u2728\ud83c\udf1f'NO- means NO! YES means YES! \n\u2728\ud83c\udf1fMaybe means I want to but I don'tForeplay Only +vibe check\ud83c\udf1f\u2728\n1) a woman CAN take away consent, at any time. \n2) women aren't responsible for you being horny. Plus, you u being attracted to us, and are politely saying \"NO! ' GET US KILLED! \nIf a man feels something it's OUR PROBLEM! they have a boner, it's our problem! If we are teased.... Still. Your problem! Lol \nMen blame us for getting Raped and killed for it!! \n\nSorry so long! Wasn't to you intentionally, you just have a cream. Comment with that woman hating incel.

OP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling upset and disappointed with the result of your experience. It seems like this experience might be a new one for you and your bf. I also think there was a lack of communication about what you were both expecting. It would probably be beneficial to have a conversation about what you both would like and not like from these type of interactions. It\u2019s important to remember not to blame the other person. Instead, phrase it in a way that reflects what would make you more comfortable. You should also be ready for the possibility that your bf may not want to do certain things, you may not also want to do certain things. Setting these boundaries is totally okay, you should do anything you don\u2019t want to. No one is to blame for these things. Relationships generally involve some give and take. Ultimately if you both want vastly different things, you might not be compatible. I wish you the best of luck!",

After care is NOT just for sex! And if this your opinion, perhaps you need to get into the kink community and submit to a female or male Dom! After care is after ANYTHING! after making out... It's the intimate part of intimacy. Just because it's called after care by some,. For others... It's common sense. \n\n8 months isn't a long time for ADULT relationships... To children IT'S LITERALLY A SCHOOL YEAR!!",

Some stuff I agree with, his delivery was shit and his overall ideology is hellish shit to be so blunt about it.\n\nI am a happily married 30 yo man, I don\u2019t need to follow anyone blindly for literally anything. I\u2019m not the only one on this thread who thought the same so I wonder what made my comment so special you just had to get your fingers going on some weird shit?\n\nGo join some kink shit? Only person I\u2019m doing anything with is my wife, only person I care to do anything for or with is my wife. I genuinely don\u2019t care about this person or her predicament like that, not personally. Just generally, and even then it\u2019s not care it\u2019s a general view. I like MANY OTHERS laid down a very genuine and honest statement given her situation. \n\nWeirdest shit I seen on this app, somebody saying this comment gives off \u201cyou can\u2019t change your mind vibes\u201d hell your comment is giving off \u201cI\u2019ve been taken advantage of and am now projecting\u201d vibes and that\u2019s just being honest",

Is this the first time you or him have gone this far intimate wise?  \n\nIf this is the first time you two have fooled around like this, I\u2019m guessing he left in a hurry due to one of the following reasons. \n1. If it was y\u2019all\u2019s first time dry humping and he didn\u2019t ejaculate, it\u2019s very likely he had blue balls and wanted to take care of that ASAP at home. \n2. He might\u2019ve ejaculated during y\u2019all\u2019s hook up and was possibly embarrassed by it and didn\u2019t want you to see the mess ejaculation tends to make.\n\nSometimes after a male will climax, they get really tired and will fall asleep almost immediately afterwards. Considering this and that it was 4am, I feel like he was beat (no pun intended) and most likely just fell asleep. Has he checked on you since or apologized for not checking in after he got home? \n\nI am assuming you both are quite young and inexperienced when it comes to being physical with your partner. Which is perfectly fine! I was a freshman when I started fooling around and truly wish I had waited a lot longer. \nIf you\u2019re having doubts or something about this feels off, even just a little bit, do not ever feel pressured into doing anything you\u2019re uncomfortable with. I would end the relationship immediately if he ever makes you feel pressured or gives you any sort of reason not to trust him. \n\nI hope everything works out for you and if you ever need someone to talk to about boys, I\u2019m your girl! You be safe, always use protection, and start birth control ASAP if you live in the US.",

When I was younger and still a Virgin, the first time having oral sex with my bf at the time made me feel used when he went home afterwards. But I recognized it wasn't normal for me to feel that way, it was just me mentally not being ready for it to happen. And that's okay. You should definitely talk to him about what you expect after intimate moments in the future but until you feel more trusting, secure and ready to have sex, I would definitely hold off on that.",

Everyone\u2019s saying this isn\u2019t the immediate reaction after intimacy and you aren\u2019t ready but idk if this is something that just changes over time?? I don\u2019t think the answer is to just stop doing anything sexual until you\u2019re \u2018ready\u2019 i mean you\u2019ll probably keep doing things with him anyways. You can\u2019t just wait and hope you\u2019ll stop feeling like this after sex, i\u2019ve had a past with a lot of mental illness and trauma around sex and this just isn\u2019t something that goes away, at least for me.

            "comment": "Lol! So, the thing is, that's actually really embarrassing FOR HIM! it's good to not give in... It makes it that much better!!! I think it was less about you and more about himself! Lol \n\nFor starters, I can tell you are incredibly young. Our sex education in the America is hot ass! First lesson, if he used you FOR THAT... Congrats love, you got off easy! Lol he got nothing!\nSecond lesson! THIS IS YOUR SPEED! YOU make the pace. I know how much you just want to lose the innocence! But hear me when I say this, sometimes, it's just not worth it. Men have to learn it too, but your boundaries are important! If you let them violate your boundaries... Well, it's endless how far they will take that! Don't wait to learn what it feels like to have one man that feels like he has 15 hands! You just can't escape them! So, hold you boundaries! It making out was all you wanted to do. That's all you wanted to do. Yes, boys also want to lose that innocence too! But it shouldn't be at the cost of yours! When you lose that safety and that choice, there's no living life the same! \nSo, in the interest of education, I am going to share this story.\n\nI wish I could say this stops at teen years, it doesn't. I wanted to fool around with this guy I knew in highschool, he was one of the captains of the football team (I later married one of the other captains, and he was incredibly abusive! I think I picked the wrong one) I had danced with just him all night at prom, but things got in the way for us to have alone time. When we were 20, When we finally got it, he was just going way too fast. When I would push away, he got more forceful. After being raped twice by 20, I was really scared. I like, turned on my stomach! In my jeans. He quickly slowed down after that. I felt a little wet on my leg. I thought it was sweat. Lol even at 20, I was still incredibly inexperienced and quite Franky, afraid of the deed- because of previous experiences. I honestly was just doing it to do it. I didn't get anything out of it. \n\nThat was until I got the right guy when I was 21. I was so uncomfortable letting it be about me. It's hard to be in certain positions because of flashbacks! But once I understood.... Well,. The way I see things is a bit different. I also have a really, really close guy friend... He literally has my nickname tattooed on his thigh! Lol, he explained why that guy from high school was so weird. Lol. HE was embarrassed! And he needed to clean up his wet spot that wasn't sweat. \n\nMy biggest lesson in this, ITS NEVER YOU! stop thinking that! If he is unable to respect your boundaries, I'm glad you got to learn this lesson before it turned into a different one. And yes! Boys will try to tell you that you can't change your mind, you absolutely CAN change your mind. You can go as far as you want, and you can stop it whenever you want! \n\nIf a boy has a weird problem, well.... That's his problem and not yours! You have a life ahead of you. And there will be more boys! And they will know how to make you feel safe and secure enough to do whatever it is you want to do! And never forget.. \"NO\" is a complete sentence...\n\nTot the boys that may read this, THIS GOES FOR YOU TOO! if you aren't ready, you aren't ready! \"NO!\" is a complete sentence\n\nYou both DO have a lot of maturing to do. But honestly, kids will be kids! Be safe! If you even think about it, get condoms and birth control! Most states have clinics that you can go to for free! Planned Parenthoods are in most states, if they aren't there, state clinics are. You just walk in and ask for condoms... And you can ask for birth control. They will schedule you an appointment, then they will give you a pap smear (just a pelvic exam to make sure everything is okay and it's safe to go on BC- it's usually women, but if it's not, you can request a woman nurse to be with you! Maybe even bring a friend) they do this for free and most states don't require parental consent. In the event that your state DOES... tell your parents you have very heavy and very painful periods (which is true. Most women have terrible periods. Our body literally dialates once a month - to be clear, that little dilation is TERRIBLE. It's literally early child birth! This is how you get on birth control without having to say you're sexually active, or you're considering becoming sexually active. \n\n\nDon't listen to incels and predators about how you should or. Should not act! Want to know who a guy is? Ask him what he thinks of. Andrew Tatem if they say ANYTHING kind about him! RUN! RUN AWAU FAST! \n\nedit: added the maturing thing \nStay safe sweet girl!!! Put yourself first! You will never leave you! You will never turn your back on you! You're a star",

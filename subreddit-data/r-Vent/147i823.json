Even if they do express how much it\u2019s been debilitating to you and how it\u2019s been stressful as hell. Don\u2019t mention anything like j may have schizophrenia only because some parents don\u2019t like accepting the fact their child could be sick. Just tell them how you been hearing things that aren\u2019t there and it\u2019s pretty much freaking you out and you want to get checked out \n In hopes it could be physical you could ask to go to your family doctor. If you have history of mental illnesses then that\u2019s something that should be talked out with the doctors as well.",

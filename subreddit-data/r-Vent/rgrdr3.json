And based on that you study. If you are a visual learner for example you should go watch videos on YouTube or on any website. if you like to listen to music while studying then don't listen to music with lyrics on them or listen to music that has lyrics of a language u don't understand so u can focus more, i recommend uplifting music. Writing down the chapters and the info helps me to memorize them better actually and sometimes i make up stories with the info and that really makes the info get stuck to my brain. Use examples from your own life while studying for example if you are studying history and you are learning about World War II then write that the parties of the war that are against each other are you and your arrival and your friends will be the alliances to the country in war for example and relate what ur friends did to you to the actions of the countries. Imm drunk so if what im saying makes no sense then i'm sorry",

    "postText": "I know this thing is comparatively pretty petty than other posts here but I have to.I want to buy a jewel set on Poshmark and some seller made me an offer.I can\u2019t accept bcs I\u2019m an international buyer and it\u2019s some third guy who earn commission on every single item I buy who buys for me and then ships things to my place.So I comment that if she could accept the offer made via another account(I asked the guy to make the seller the same-priced offers two times)but she commented sorry she didn\u2019t see it and I commented saying the offer would be made again pls check and hoped she could accept but then she blocked me.Am I annoying to people?I was only trying to be polite and I hate bothering others too.And that\u2019s how I got totally in a fit of rage.It\u2019s strange,right?She\u2019s got reason to,and I know,and yes it\u2019s like a super trivial thing to be mad about,but I lose it and am extra angry when she blocked me rudely.I was polite,I was buying.I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve got all this ego,this hypersensitivity,it\u2019s hard,it\u2019s really hard.To be overly reactive to things,it\u2019s morbid and unhealthy.I know she has the right to,but I can\u2019t control myself.What\u2019s wrong with me?I react to every F thing in life like this when being not so well treated.I care for people\u2019s opinion for me too much.It\u2019s difficult.I\u2019m tired.I\u2019ve been like this a thousand times before for other stupid things.\nSorry I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.Just,be kind pls.Don\u2019t comment something unkind to me again.I think I\u2019m a kind person who\u2019s got a freakishly fragile heart.Peevish,skittish heart.",

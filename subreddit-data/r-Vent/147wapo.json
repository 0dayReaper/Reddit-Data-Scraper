    "postText": "MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING FOR ANOREXIA \nPlease dont read if you struggle with an ed\n\nIm 15 and my eating disorder started off in elementary school when i used to feel othered for my weight, the problem then was I wasn't anywhere near overweight or even chubby. i was a healthy weight always at times i was even underweight at certain times until puberty. I think it might just be heavy bones at this point or something but after struggling with barely eating through middleschool and elementary. Starting highschool i finally made the decision to do better by myself. It really didnt work and i started to fixate on calories even more then before, refusing to eat anything i couldnt count the calories for. The problem now isn't weight but i built a fear of eating a fear of calories. I dont care about the weight gain anymore but when i eat something i feel like ive committed a crime or something. The guilt gets overwhelming, i cant explain it in a way that someone without an eating disorder can understand but it's like money. Think of my nutrients as bills i need to pay, the calories are my paycheck for the day, junk food or high calorie foods are like unnecessary but fun items. I see it like that, if i use my daily intake on high calorie foods that lack nutrition im wasting it. i will not say how much my intake is since thats extremely triggering to some people. But if i even eat 1/10 of my daily intake as a single snack i feel guilty. And in the sense that someone saves for a vacation i save for high calorie meals. Ill wait an entire day to eat if i know my dad has a big meal planned. It's so draining having to  think about every little thing i eat. I have trouble admitting its getting bad again, im scared ill end up sick again. In middle school i had to start taking iron supplments made for adults because i became severely anemic. I don't want to be sick again, I don't want to feel as if im going to pass out in half my classes, i dont want to lash out on the people i love, i dont want to rely on caffeine for energy, i dont want to feel dizzy when i get up, i want to be motivated and live a better life but i dont know how to. I know im sick and im trying to fix it but its so hard and it keeps getting worse i dont know what to do. I don't want to be told that im beautiful no matter my weight every time i open up about my disorder because im not doing it for vanity anymore, im doing it out of habit and it makes me feel small and vain when i am spoken to in a way that implies that im doing it because im so desperate to be skinny. I just want to be heard and listened to but i know people wont see it that way because im young and stupid. Thank you for reading this far if you have.",

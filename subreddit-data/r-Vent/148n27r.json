So tired of having to try and strain my ears to decipher these midday drunks slurring their way through their meetings. Chill out with the 4 margarita lunches if you want people to be able to understand your project requirements, or figure out why we're even sitting here on this call listing to your tired-ass marble mouth. Doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out why the slurring always goes hand-in-hand with the camera being off.\n\nThese sloppy lush middle-managers and directors are the ones that need to go back to the office to be babysat.

    "postText": "I need to vent. I have a sex addiction and I hired a prostitute last Monday, we did everything with a condom except for oral sex. Since Friday I have a slightly sore throat, extreme discomfort in the penis and anus (not pain, more like a tingling feeling). On Wednesday, I was treated at the doctor's with antibiotics. I think I probably got Chlamydia and/or Gonorrhea. I went to the doctor yesterday (a week after the incident) who examined me and asked for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests but did not give me any more treatment. Tests will only be ready this Friday. To make matters worse, since I live with my girlfriend, we've had sex since I met the prostitute. I am afraid that she has contracted the same infection that I have. The symptoms of discomfort started on Friday, and since then I have been avoiding sexual relations with her. To make matters worse, she is from the health sector and knows the symptoms and has easy access to test kits. Telling her the real thing means ending the relationship, and I really want the relationship. I don't have anyone to talk to about this since none of my family and friends know about my problem, and I can't see myself telling them about it etiher. On Sunday I have an appointment with a psychologist to see if I can get help with my sex addiction, I'm tired of being like this. I don't know what to do now. The prospects of having passed an infection to her is toturing me. I've never been this nervous in my entire life. I hope that the tests will come back negative, but all my instincts are telling me that I got a STD as I can't think of any other non-sexually transmitted infection that can pass from throat to penis.",

Did you feel guilt when you were looking for a prostitute or when you first thought about \"hey let me go hurt my girlfriend behind her back and hire a hooker\".\n\nAlls I have to say is please tell her, do the right thing, I know I'm not supposed to judge someone off their actions but this is an acception, also if you really do have problems Highly suggest seeing a therapist as this could be a problem in future relationships if  you get any depensing in what you have or you possibly hiring more prostitutes and catching something very very life threatening.",

You only are getting sex help at this moment, and even care about what happened is because of the very fact you might have a STD. sure you\u2019re worried she has it, only due to the fact it\u2019s because she will eventually find out because of it that her partner is a cheater. You only care about yourself in this situation, even if you say you care about her\u2026 it\u2019s only because you\u2019re in hot water. Grow a pair, tell her, and face the consequences you need to face because that\u2019s the first step growing out of being the person you currently are.",

I would probably omit the prostitute part. It\u2019s weird to see a prostitute while you\u2019re in a relationship, never the less, tell her you hooked up with someone out of weakness and that you are going to get tested, tell her she should do the same, pay for her test and medication if necessary. Accept that you have probably ended your relationship. Accept how she wants to proceed. Most importantly forgive yourself and have more self control next time. This isn\u2019t the end of the world, don\u2019t harm yourself, just accept reality and proceed accordingly.",

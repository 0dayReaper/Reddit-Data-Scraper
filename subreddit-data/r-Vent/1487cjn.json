    "postText": "i\u2019m a male 18 years old, my girlfriend was 17 just turned 18 we\u2019ve been dating for seven months now in less than a month that we started dating we wanted to do it but when we tried, I couldn\u2019t get it up. I felt so embarrassed and mad. I didn\u2019t know if it was me or if it was my body. she said it was OK.  so we waited. In a few months later we tried again same result. There since I\u2019ve been scared that I won\u2019t be to get it up again. But recently, after she turned 18 never do any type of foreplay he gets up and stiff. so I\u2019m wondering if I should try again or what should I do not to get scared",

I think it was all in my head. If you're nervous of course it's going to cause some problems with your penis. Stress, fear, worry is the killer of the boner.",

That\u2019s a big turn off for a first time and if you plan it you are just going to think about what you are going to do next. If for some reason it doesnt go as you planned, you will get frustrated with yourself and oh well\u2026 he\u2019s going down!\n\nDont think and enjoy the moment with her, you will be fine for sure. Good luck!\n\nI hope it helps",

Once you start overthinking it's game over. I'd tell her it's your first time, ain't nothing wrong with that at all. You're both young there's no shame in it. I think once you tell her you'll be more comfortable mentally the next time you guys do it",

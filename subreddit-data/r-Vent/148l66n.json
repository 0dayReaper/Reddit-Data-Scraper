    "postText": "I desperately wish I could help her. Setting all facts aside that we already know about her being 28 and everything, she is still an eating disorder victim.\n\nStill to this day she pops up on my YouTube shorts feed. I personally haven't dealt with an eating disorder but I have anxiety and seeing her makes me feel lightheaded and like my heart is beating fast. I'm not mad at her. I just pray that she can get help. I know there's no use in worrying about things I can't help but even if she's doing this intentionally, deep down she is suffering and her perceptions must be distorted. What is happening to her is, to say the least, devastating.\n\nPlease God, please, help Eugenia Cooney.\n\nEdit: To reminisce a bit: I remember a few years ago when Shane Dawson interviewed her and she looked like she was becoming healthier. It was a huge breath of relief and then Jaclyn Glenn made her video saying she didn't think it would last. I hoped she was wrong, but it happened. And maybe everything she said about her mother was true too, I don't know. But the entire situation puts a feeling of despair in the pit of my stomach...",

I've never been one to watch her stuff but I've always been aware of her and she seems sweet but super delusional.\n\n Apparently her mum feeds into alot of this bs and she gets more views posting videos where her skinniness shocks people. I've seen alot of people hating her in the comments for continuing to post these videos despite the outrage and people are saying she's taking advantage but no one in their right mind would do that. She needs help and she's not getting it. On the other hand, some people are so far gone mentally they don't seem to ever be able to recover and I worry that's the case here..",

The best thing for people to do in that case is to probably just say nothing at all. I feel negative attention would just make the situation worse.",

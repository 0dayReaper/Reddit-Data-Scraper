    "postText": "This has been an ongoing thing throughout the past 3 months, but what happened is I [18M] did something bad to my friend [17NB] (they use they/them pronouns so please respect them) that I thought would be harmless, but later on I\u2019d find out that it was harmful. I apologized for what I did a few days later, and they forgave me, but said that things will never be the same again. \n\nI am very hard on myself due to the household I grew up in, since my mom would alway be on my ass for even the most minor mistakes like dropping a fork, spilling water on the floor, etc. which is why anytime I make a mistake, I am beating myself up for it, and it varies depending on severity of the mistake. So because if this I did what I always did whenever I make a mistake, beat myself up for it, self punish, and it even went as extreme as me almost c*mmitting s****** because of the extreme guilt I felt. I also started distancing myself from them, because I was overthinking things out of control. \n\nThis lasted for atleast 2 months until I decided that although I felt bad, I missed them more than I felt bad, so I decided to take the actual steps to start and recover the friendship. So I texted them, explaining why I have been so distant and apologized for it, and explained how I wanted to recover our friendship. They stood with what they said originally, that things will never be the same again, but we could still be friends. They explained the reason why was because what I did reminded them of past trauma that they went through, and that that was the reason they were hurt. I apologized yet again, but they didn\u2019t respond. \n\nI couldn\u2019t accept this response because this person means a lot to me, being friends with this person means a lot to me, to the point where I was willing to break life long habits to try and fix things with them, but they just weren\u2019t very responsive to those. If we were to move forward with that resentment towards me at the back of their mind, then ultimately we would both hurt, they hurt because they\u2019re not willing to let go of the past, and I hurt because I will never be able to forgive myself for what I did, knowing that they\u2019re still hurting.\n\nA week later, I decided to try one more time to try and recover the friendship by trying to convince them to try and put this behind us. We were on a call for like 2 hours, and there were a lot of details, but ultimately we agreed to start over the next day, and see what goes until then. The next day comes, and they had something to do during that day, and I understood, but they never got back to me since. I tried reaching out to them on like 3 different occasions through text and they never responded. To this day I have no idea why they did it. \n\nEver since then, I have spent pretty much every day missing them, missing their presence, their sense of humor, their hilarious stories, their trust and care, and really just everything about them. I graduated high school recently, and I wrote letters to all my friends, and told one of my other friends to distribute them. I wrote a letter to this friend and it was really just thanking them for everything and that despite the way things ended, I am glad to have had them as a friend, aswell as a poligizijg for everything. And I still don\u2019t know if they read it or not, but it\u2019s whatever. I am probably never gonna see them again, but it still just hurts too much to miss them.",

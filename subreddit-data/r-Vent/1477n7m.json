    "postText": "I'm a 21 year old male. Here's my background info I was raised without my parents, my dad in particular didn't like how I was raised. My uncle confirmed it 2 years ago, I wasn't a hood guy, I wasn't someone in the street life. If you are black, you would understand. My mom kept moving around with her new boyfriends. All my life, I was forced to grow up and mature. I didn't have a real childhood and or social life. I had a severe stutter, shyness, and stumbling over of my words in elementary, middle school, and early high school. I was poor, didn't have much. I mostly ate cereal and ramen back in those days.  I was bullied in the beginning of Instagram, someone took a picture of me without me noticing and posted to his social media saying how I smelled funny. I was also heavily obese in high school, so seeing that on Instagram with the way I looked and that caption, it made me depressed for a while.  It was embarrassing, I'm a totally different person who basically reinvented myself, but deep down I'm still a nervous antisocial wreck because of those things. I don't even know how to talk to females or friends my age without being nervous or scared that they won't like me or just abandon me like my parents. My cousins are alcoholics and my family love to gossip and drama. So, it's hard for me to confine in them, because they will either spread it to other members or they will make it about them and tell me how their life is worst. I guess in the end, I don't know who I am suppose to be or what I should do. I don't know how to love someone, I don't know how to live a normal life. I have so much baggage inside of me, that sometimes it just overwhelms me.",

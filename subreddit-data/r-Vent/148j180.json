    "postText": "It was over a trivial thing but turned into a full lash out.So instead of yelling back or anything I just walked away from the situation and because of that my mother started to cry and I became her therapist for all the problems she has in the world.\n\nI doubt it she will ever apologize for actually yelling at me because after my father confronted her about it she talked as if her lashing out on me never happened.I doubt that she will apologize on her own unless I will pout and becone cold.But I'm not going to do it.It's just that I'm going to distrust her now.I'm an adult and she's an adult and I never lashed out like that on anyone but it seems like people in my life (now including my mother) really like yelling at me,calling me stupid,getting violent with me etc. I realize now it was like that since childhood.\n\nI just want to feel loved and treated gently for once,man.",

What have you been up to?\u201d, I do that for him and he doesn\u2019t do it back. I get that you may not wanna speak everyday but still feels like we don\u2019t talk enough. You know that feeling when you just like someone and you feel like crawling into their mind and just, talking to them?? That\u2019s how I feel, but I don\u2019t think he feels the same way. I think he just forgets about me because of his interests and school and whatever and he doesn\u2019t feel the need to talk to me. \n\nWe\u2019re also both introverts so \ud83d\udc80 we\u2019re fucked. However I do try make plans with him but for one reason or the other we cancel and we haven\u2019t seen each other lately, first I was sick, then he got sick (sore throat) and said he didn\u2019t want to get me sick again but still, I mean we could still talk in calls, or by texting but not much of that has happened. I am always the one suggesting we call each other and not him and I\u2019d just like to see that bit of attention from him. \n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the fact that we were best friends before being a couple (and I mean we are still friends but as a couple) and sometimes I wonder if he just sees me as a friend. Idk I see other relationships in social media and they seem to be so much more in love. But love is also created, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s there by magic but something you build with someone through your words and actions. We need opportunities for us to be together. Dude how can I like someone I don\u2019t see irl that much? xD\n\nAnyway I don\u2019t think I want advice or anything but I just wanted to vent. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s very bad or anything, some people have it worse",

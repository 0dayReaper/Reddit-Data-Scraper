Watched plenty of gore/horror/action movies. \n\nI haven't skinned animals or shot up a building. \n\nThe cause doesn't come from media, but lack of parenting, abuse, mental illness or all of the above. \n\nWhat's sad nowadays is that bandaid solution to poor parenting is stimulates vs therapy (no objective test needed... just a questionnaire).",

It sounds like he's acting out in the most over the top way because he knows it's getting him attention, even if it's bad attention.\n\nIt sounds like you're all dealing with a lot, would therapy be possible for your brother? This is definitely something that needs addressing before he gets older, BUT although he's your brother, you're not responsible for him. Your parents are.\n\nI know they have a lot on their plates too, I grew up in a similar household and practically raised my little brother. He's autistic and although he was never violent, me being 6 and him being 4, it was hard to understand why he wouldn't just do the things I told him to.\n\nPlease don't feel like you have to shoulder this burden alone, if there's another trusted adult in your life like a grandparent or a teacher I'd suggest speaking to them about your concerns as well since your mum doesn't seem to listen.",

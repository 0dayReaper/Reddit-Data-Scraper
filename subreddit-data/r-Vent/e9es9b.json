    "postText": "Let me clarify. They SHOULD be accepted, they SHOULD be supported, but to celebrate them, call them brave, courageous, or being proud of them for it is just hurtful to the spouse. what if the straight spouse came out and said 'I have discovered I have no sexual or romantic feeling towards my partner, so I am leaving them to persue other people'. They wouldn't be celebrated; they would be vilified. \n\nThe double standard here sucks. I'm going through this now. I love my wife. I support her, and accept her for who she is. But having people celebrate the end of my marriage so she can be with someone else, and congratulating her for it has me just burning.",

I'm not sure, or saying your situation is similar, but it never hurts to find a good ear to talk to,  maybe talk to a therapist if you can.",

They aren't proud of her for hurting you, they are proud of her for deciding to not lie to you and hurt you worse that you should have to bear.\n\n I'm sorry that you are going through this and I understand that this is probably warping the way you think right now and that is okay, you deserve the right to process it. But just as people are celebrating her bravery as well as honesty rather than lead you on or even cheat instead of giving you a chance to find someone else who you may care for again, we should celebrate those like you who support her and still love/care for her and wish her the best despite all the hurt you feel from it all.\n\nYou know it isn't in anyone's control but I bet there are still those lingering thoughts that make you want to be mad at her or blame her for it, yet you don't. That is what real love and that showed you truly loved her and I really do hope you two can remain in friends after this since you said you still support her. Some people only love someone until it is no longer convenient or in their best interest and love doesn't work that way. If your feelings can just be shut off then you never loved her in the first place and you should reevaluate how you see love. \n\nI wish you the best, I wish her the best, and I wish anyone dealing with all of this the best. I disagree with some of what you have to say but seeing you coming from an emotional and hurt state when you said all this I don't think you deserve any hate.",

We can start with the insensitive of it. I lost my spouse. I know why people are supporting it and accepting. Hell, I accepted it. I recognize that I'm not what she needs anymore, and I'm not the best thing for her. But those congratulatory messages are insensitive and hurtful to someone greiving the loss of that relationship. If my marriage had ended another way,I would be given support myself. But it has been very one sided. 'good job on coming out and living your truth' meanwhile my world is broken. \n\nThe double standard is also shocking. If I decided I didn't feel attraction to her, but still was heterosexual, should I be celebrated for deciding to end my relationship instead of cheating? Am I brave? Should people be proud of me for telling the truth? Attraction is biological, that might be completely out of my hands as well. \n\nI accept it wasn't my spouse's choice. My spouse wasn't malicious, she's not seeking glory either. This isn't directed at her. I'm just hurt at how I'm in grieving, and the insensitive that a celebration of the truth has on those left behind.",

Just because you support her doesn't mean you aren't hurt. You deserve support as well. I am sorry that it seems like it is only her getting the support that you deserve as well. Relationships are a two person thing, there are always two sides and in this case both sides deserve compassion. \n\nI hope that you get the support you need, I hope you remain friends and that she can be there for you as you are there for her. Unfortunately nothing is black and white and there are always going to be those in betweens that cause people to be conflicted with themselves and in the end result it shitty situations like this.\n\nI wish you all the best and it is honestly 1000% commendable that through all the hurt you aren't lashing out like some do.",

They find someone who they like, and enjoy and assume it is romantic and assume that they are feeling the right things because they never explored because they always assumed they were straight and assumed they should only look for a romantic relationship in someone of the opposite gender. When they realize that they are gay and feel REAL romantic feelings for THE FIRST TIME in their life, only then are they able to understand why they never quite felt so attached romantically. I doubt it is something they wanted to do, I doubt hurting someone else was their intentions either. In fact I and Fairly sure most people in this type of situation 100% believed it themselves that they were straight, and if it wasn't 100% and they had their doubts then they lied to themselves and tricked themselves into believing it. They are brave for telling the truth once they actually realized it all. \n\nAdmitting you fucked up isn't an easy thing to do, admitting you are gay is also not easy. So I would assume the pressure would be even more intense when you have more than the usual expectations from people to be straight. When everyone expects you to try and make your marriage work because \"it's the right thing to do\" or they don't want to hurt their spouse and would rather go on LYING to EVERYONE just to avoid looking bad.. \n\nlike honestly it's easier to lie, to cheat behind the spouses back, not lose your home and everything you have ever known, possibly lose a friend because I doubt they hate their spouse, they are gay, not having a disagreement. They risk losing a friend, a best friend, but decided that being honest is the right thing to do. \n\nThat is why they are brave, they didn't pick the \"easy\" route. Another route would be to come up with some bullshit excuse for a divorce just to not admit that you are gay, not give them real answers. It could save face, make it feel like it didn't just work out. Plenty do that, but is it right? No that's a cowards way out. \n\nTo come out to your spouse and to be 100% honest with them, yourself and everyone you know is the best but probably hardest thing to do for most people. It doesn't change what a shitty situation it is and how it can mess with people but it does show that as a person you own up to any hurt you may have caused, you own up to who you are, you show that even though the situation is shitty, you chose to avoid making it even more shitty. \n\nIt doesn't make anyone who is a victim less of a victim but it is hard for everyone in the situation. If the person who came out married this person, most likely they were close enough to mistake their friendship for romantic love and I doubt they feel good about hurting them and they may got through years of self hate or have already if they don't come out as soon as they realize over it.",

Yes there are a loud minority that have shitty attitudes about bi people but most people don't give a shit, even more so if you're already in a hetero relationship.

When I was 16 I lost my virginity to my boyfriend and then he broke up with me \"because he was gay\".... Except he wasn't. He might have been bi or poly, but he got *straight* back together with his ex girlfriend... So I think that it's also fair to let time tell as well.",

The only reason others are able to celebrate is because they aren't burdened with the pain of losing someone you love and cherish, they just want to support their friend or family.\n\nI hope in time though, as others are doing now you can celebrate this too. It may not feel like a cause to celebrate but in some sense it is. Your spouse felt so pressured by the environment she grew up in that they fully ran away from how they truly felt so they could appease whoever. Her being at a point in her life where she feels comfortable coming out as who she is, is massive. Especially under your circumstances. This doesn't feel like a win and it won't. But you should try and take a step back and see how this is good for her. She can be here truest self now and not have to hide from who she is. \n\nI hope im not coming off as insensitive. I just think it's important to understand her view and how this looks from the outside as well.",

Some may even believe themselves to be Bi, but faced with a first experience find that they aren't. It doesn't suck any less for their spouse, or even for them in some cases. We make the best choirs we can in the moment. \n\nMy frustration is that most don't take in the whole picture. The feelings of those in grieving are not considered. If my spouse had died, people would be grieving with me. If my spouse had cheated, I could have someone to blame and those around me would know how to support me. If my spouse and I suffered from a loss of communication we could go to counseling and people would know how to support us together. But with this, I'm alone, and she's surrounded by the 'glory' of her discovery. Not that she asked for it, or wanted it. \n\nBut with this? People have no fucking clue what to do with me.",

If you've ever been to a \"celebration of life\" insteaf of a funeral, its the same concept. Choosing to have an event to celebrate the beginning of what is new and the good of what once was, instead of moping over the good of what once was, and the end of what is old.",

Especially when someone is married, because more than likely the reason they even got married in the first place is because they probably felt living a lie for the rest of their lives, making OTHERS happy (spouse, family) was their only option. It SHOULD be celebrated that they escaped the mental trap they were in. Sure, empathy for ANY spouse being left, by some gay or straight, but you can not take away the milestone of coming out simply because YOU haven\u2019t lived that life and YOU don\u2019t understand what that does to you. It\u2019s pretty selfish, actually. That\u2019s like when parents say, I accept you just don\u2019t tell anyone (aka I don\u2019t accept you), or I\u2019m ok with it just don\u2019t make it obvious (I\u2019m not ok with it). It is unfortunate for you, but if you\u2019re losing someone that was not even attracted to you in the first place, are you REALLY losing at all?",

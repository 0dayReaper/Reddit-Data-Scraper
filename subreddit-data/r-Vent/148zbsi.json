    "postText": "I am so angry. On so many levels. And I don\u2019t even blame the person across the road that ran a red light or the person behind me that hit my car. I was working to pay my bills. And I\u2019m not talking to my family right now. (My dad and my brother crossed the line with me on my birthday and my mom lied to my face about my dad\u2019s behavior). I feel genuinely alone and trying not to wonder why I deserved this. \n\nBut shit happens. And it is what it is. But nothing I wanted to happen is happening and I am doing my best not to give up on everything I\u2019m working so hard towards. \n\nIt was a pretty bad hit. My whole bumper is off and my trunk is crunched. Luckily my tires and alignment work enough to get me home. \n\nBut now I can\u2019t work and I\u2019m broke and I feel utterly alone. So alone.",

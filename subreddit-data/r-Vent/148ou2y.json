    "postText": "Like she\u2018s an only child and she quite literally does dumb younger siblings shit all the time. I\u2019ll check up on her and be having to bite back the screaming I want to do because of course she\u2019s out doing something she has no business doing \ud83d\ude2d. We\u2019re both the same age but she has me stressed about her finances, her safety, her whereabouts. And she\u2019ll laugh and giggle when she says something she\u2019ll know that will make me blow my top like it\u2019s a game. Surprisingly this isn\u2019t a negative post she\u2019s really just like a sister in my eyes but me and my siblings chilled out as we got older so I haven\u2019t had to use my big sister voice in years before I met her so it\u2019s funny catching myself slipping back in that role. I\u2019ll plan an outing to spoil my siblings and I\u2019ll sit there wondering why we need an extra seat when we\u2019ve always had enough, whole time it\u2019s because I\u2019m forgetting she didn\u2019t grow up with us so I don\u2019t think about the right amount of chairs despite the fact that I know I\u2019m bringing her out too.",

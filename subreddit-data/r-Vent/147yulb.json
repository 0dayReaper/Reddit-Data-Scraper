    "postText": "I\u2019m 16. I have a single father. Family members died so we got a decent check. My father has been working on renovating our trashy trailer. I say that harshly because with the amount put in we should\u2019ve just gotten a real house or invested in important things like his deteriorating body which if you\u2019re going to moan and groan about take the money and fix yourself. He\u2019s self employed so he doesn\u2019t have a strict schedule to work around, he could go through with his millionth time promising to get me braces which have made me cry and insecure for. \nI put up the idea of me getting a job and he shut me down. I wanted to get my license and he said you\u2019re not experienced enough. Well fair enough but when i want to practice parking, which is whats holding me back, i get verbally abused. I want a job to pay for my stupid looking teeth, but whoopsie cant get money if dear old dad wont let me get a job. Im stuck here and I\u2019ve felt so depressed because i do nothing at home and never go out. I\u2019ve recently started summer college classes so im free but it pisses me off seeing all these kids with their cars and jobs being independent. Its not even independence i just want to get away from my father. He\u2019s emotionally abusive sometimes and even verbally, calling me a r**ard, b**ch, and other fun names. I cant talk to him without feeling like im walking on egg shells or im going to get degraded or yelled at for 3 hours straight. I do everything i can to keep him calm. I dont even do things my friends offer sometimes because he gives me dirty looks or acts like im asking for a million dollars. He gives me dirty looks all the time and is snarky and rude. Then gaslights me and love bombs me saying \u201cplease stay dont leave i need you\u201d yeah right i do so much cleaning and housework EVERY Saturday you wouldn\u2019t know what to do. I know he\u2019s trying his best as a single dad thats basically unemployed and he probably has mental issues- i love him and respect his goals, but Im too tired from my food struggles and personal mental issues and caring for everyone but myself to care. I want to take my life into my own hands without mooching off of someone. I think im becoming depressed because i cry almost every day because i feel like a loser. I try to occupy myself and learn guitar and speak spanish but im just depressed.",

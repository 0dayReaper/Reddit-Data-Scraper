    "postText": "i tore a ligament in my neck last week and recovery has been incredibly painful and unpleasant. i can\u2019t do anything but lay around in a neck brace and take muscle relaxers all day, and i just look and feel so\u2026 hurt. it\u2019s hard to do anything normal around the house like anything including any sort of bending or maneuvering my head\u2026 cleaning is a no go, showering has been hard, i can\u2019t drive which sucks. overall i hate this feeling, my neck feels so tender and hot, and i\u2019m in this brace another 4 weeks. it\u2019s also really warm where i live so not excited to spend a month sweating myself all day in this giant thing\ud83d\ude42 i just wish i didn\u2019t hurt myself, this sucks",

    "postText": "I am 20 and I know I'm young but I feel like I could be living so much more.\nI study hard, I have a degree, I have my own business , I have my own hobbies, but this loneliness is so consuming.\nMy love life is an absolute disaster , I've done the same relationship dynamic over and over , I always choose men that live very far away and in my current relationship he lives another continent away so.. we basically never met in person. I tried to talk to him about meeting and although he said he wanted to , i said we should meet halfway and for him I felt like he was saying it would be way too much work and money thrown away ( I made him aware I was feeling this way).\nLately all he does is work and work and now I'm noticing that literally because of the time difference half of my day is gone and we haven't talked, although I stay late sometimes forcing myself not to sleep just to have a bit of communication he still takes atleast 15 min to answer and I can't have a straight conversation with him only when we are on call, which I've given up on asking to because he is always either tired or busy. When we do call it's good, but it doesn't ask very long because of our schedules 2 hours max.\nSometimes I wonder if I just like being alone physically, but I know I don't like being alone I'm just really awkard with touch, but I don't do it on purpose.\nDon't take me wrong I don't want to sound weird but I am average looking ,do alot of crafts and am pretty nerdy, I don't have any issues in grabbing the attention of men, however , I seem to always get attached to the ones that don't want me after some time. I've been in some relationships, including one that lasted 5 years, it left me with alot of emotional trauma unfortunately and I feel like I either never believe someone will ever like me or I'm not worthy of love ... that I've done something wrong or something is wrong with me. I've made my partner aware of how I spiral in my own thoughts and he usually tries to calm me down and make me aware that they are just \"thoughts\".\nBut looking at it.. I'm always alone, everyday, I wake up alone, I eat alone, I go out alone, I spend all days alone, and it's getting to the point I wake up in the middle of the night wondering if it's going to be always like this and if someone, or something is gonna make me believe I am worthy of love, someone that won't be afraid to call me when I'm in trouble, making sure im ok, or hold me when i have to cry.\nI know I entered a relationship knowing fully well or it's circumstances, but I just can't handle this loneliness anymore.\nPeople my age are getting married , having kids , getting houses as couples and although I do have achievements professionally I still feel very immature love wise.\nThat's it sorry for the long rant.",

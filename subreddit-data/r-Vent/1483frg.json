    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to purchase a preowned home from a private seller, but I\u2019m running into so many road blocks. At first it was that the mortgage companies would only finance it after it was on our property (how am I supposed to get it on the property if I can\u2019t pay for it?), and now I\u2019m learning that the homes can no longer be financed after it\u2019s been moved a second time. I was so excited for this. It was the exact floor plan I wanted at a much better price then what the dealers were selling it for, and in amazing condition. The other problem is that I want to put it on my parents land, but most of the lenders need the land tied into the loan. It is not a good time to buy, let alone refinance, rn and I don\u2019t want to ask my parents to do that. Every time I think I\u2019m getting a step ahead something pulls me two steps back. I\u2019m just getting so tired. I want out of these high ass rents in apartments, and the monthly payment would have been less than half my rent. It sucks.",

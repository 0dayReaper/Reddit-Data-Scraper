    "postText": "Frustrated about so many things.\n\nFirst, I am a \"single mom\" (I don't like saying that because I have 50/50 custody so they have another parent in their life) of 3 kids. And although I have a \"decent\" job, with the recent cost increase of everything, I am going to have to get a second job. I dont live an extravagant lifestyle, my most expensive purchases are kids clothing (Walmart and Old navy clearance) and dinner out with the kids, rarely. \n\nSecond, my ex treated me really poorly in the end of our marriage. I was diagnosed with taking chronic health condition, and he regularly told me I was lazy and worthless for things i couldnt control. Now my children think it's acceptable to say those things to me as well.  The reason this is so annoying today, is because my ex is sick, he has multiple infections he has been battling for a few days. Nothing earth shattering but needs medicine, so I offered to keep the kids some additional days so he could rest. I dont need thank yous or acknowledgement but it hits harder that I am still bending over backwards to make his life easier and being called fat and lazy daily by my kids. My daughter told me yesterday \"mom you fat because you just sit around and eat only junk food. I know dad told me\"  this was said as we were on a 2 mile nature walk.... \n\nPlus work sucks,  men are stupid, and the world is useless. \n\nThe End \ud83d\ude44",

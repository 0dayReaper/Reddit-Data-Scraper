    "postText": "\r  \n\r  \nI (16) am a nonbinary teenager trying to get through life. Taking to friends, School and Spending time with my family. My mother (49) a year ago was diagnosed with ADHD which had put her in depression for a few months. My mother suffers from Epilepsy since the age of 12, and honestly, she hasn't had a lot of seizures in along time, maybe a few but shes been really good since shes taking medication but shes changing alot.\r  \nMy mother is very spiritual and I am not, I'm an athiest not like that matters but she believes god is in everyone so I don't really care but as long as shes happy. she recently has been reading a lot of tarot readings and watching videos about the end of the world and god and satan (Which I don't really mind).\r  \n\r  \nRecently shes going out on weekends and coming back because she was seeing someone, she use to date someone whos a big father figure to me and they broke up but he still lives with us helping me and my brother out. and i accidently found out when trying to call my mumx ex to ask where my phone was because i was going out soon and i accidently found texts between them. I freaked out but she told me so that's meh.\r  \nBut something that concerns me is a few packages came in the mail and when i went to open them because well they were under my mums name and she likes me opening them to see what they are, there was books about witch craft, potion making, spells and summoning of demons and angels.\r  \nI thought it was a funny joke til i read through and realised this was real and i haven't yet talked to her because at the moment shes not home and will be coming tomorrow. I also found ingredients and small pieces of animals feet and fur... and some of these spells are kinda creepy to name a few\r  \n\"How to control your animals\" \"How to get rich with potions\" \"How to make people love you again\"\r  \n\r  \nAnd I'm not trying to sound mean... but this has been going on for along time and its stressing me in my school and it freaks me out, i cant sleep because shes on the tv watching this stuff and shes in her room, and it smells of sage and lavender and perfume with candles lit and she is watching a video titled \"How to remove demons from your house\" And it scares me!!!\r  \nI got so much stress with my own personal life and shes been trying to put this stuff on me and i cant take it...",

            "comment": "Your mom sounds like she is going on a journey. My mother did the same and is still spiritual. It's totally okay to not be into that kind of thing but don't let it stress you. She is doing things for herself. She is exploring and reading so I know the feeling of how some books can definitely scare you. What I did was just be a listening ear but express how it's not your style but you respect it. As far as the smell not everyone likes sage and it's strong. Try suggesting incense instead or essential oils.",

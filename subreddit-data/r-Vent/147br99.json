Just letting it sit there is nasty. .now, it could be possible that this person simply doesn't use her Facebook.account.anymore...i.guess that is.a.possibiloty.  but I doubt it.\n\nI confess I have had a.dark.and.checkquered past, but I have grown amd am trying to make up for theat past.\n\nI understand that there might be.skme people from my past that don't want.to.deal.withe.\n\nSo,.just say that.\n\nMessage me.and.say, \"you know what, I can appreciate that you areakingthe effort to change,.but I just feel like.qe can't be friends at this point.\"\n\nSomething like that.  Just ignoring it let's the scratch fester.\n\nI start worrying about whether I really am.a.horrible.person. .or maybe there is skme.gossip. .or.this, or.tjat.\n\nIf you just don't want.to deal with me, just say that.\n\nI will appreciate knowing.we should just not bother.\n\nBut ignoring someone.is.just q.dick move.",

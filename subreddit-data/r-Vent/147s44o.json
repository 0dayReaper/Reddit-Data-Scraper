    "postText": "its hard for me to get attached to someone, but once i get attached its a really intense thing. and we are broken up since yesterday but i\u2019ve come to terms with it today, i even had a therapy session. my friends are proud of me for finally being off him. but i miss him so much, the way he hugged me and kissed me. i love him so much but it wasnt meant to be, it wouldnt work out because only i was the one putting effort to make it work, but he just relied everything on me. \n\nits so painful to loose someone that close to my heart, unfortunately i will love him forever because he is my dear now ex boyfriend that i love deeply. i got so attached to him and reliant on his love. sadly it was never meant to be. it would never work out, we fought a lot. \n\nnow i just feel like im unlovable, because all of those things he said to me, how hypocritical i am, how i didnt show him love, but i really did show him my love, i corrected myself for him to not be upset that my love js too little. i feel unlovable, like i never was meant to be loved, like i dont deserve love, like i dont deserve anyone to love me and for me to love them. i love expressing love. \n\ni want someone to love and hug, and kiss on the cheek and tell them i love them so much\n\nmy friends tell me that love will come to me, and that it wouldn\u2019t br like this, that i\u2019ll find someone that actually appreciates me for who i am, with all my flaws and mistakes from the past. they tell me its not going to be the same. i just dony feel like i deserve love, that im unlovable and worthless, he messed me up so much, why did he wanted me to hurt this much, he even said so that he wanted me to hurt more thats why he was texting then. but also he did bunch of toxic stuff to me. i dont feel in the right mindset to talk about it yet. it\u2019s especially hard because he hurt me on purpose (emotionally), and i would never think he would betray me like this.\n\ni just feel unlovable. am i unlovable? will the feeling pass on its own? will i ever find love?",

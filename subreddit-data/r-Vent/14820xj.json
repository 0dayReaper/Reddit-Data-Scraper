    "postText": "I am trying to let off steam and not have my wife join me in a anxiety attack..... We are supposed to be closing on a house tomorrow and the home owner, and selling agent have been the worst at staying in touch. They have not confirmed on any of their paper work in the last few days. I'm scared because we have just canceled our lease agreement and only have 2 weeks left in our current house. And I no longer know if I will be getting the home I have invested a lot of time, money, and credit score hits into. I really hope all of this works out as I Don't want my wife to feel what I am currently feeling.\n\n\nUpdate: the seller went on vacation.",

Any worrying about it before hand is borderline masochist behavior. \n\nIf you have any power in helping/fixing/changing this problem then that\u2019s a different story, but if your hands are tied\u2026there\u2019s no point in torturing yourself.",

    "postText": "my sexual drive has been at an all time high, ever since a harassment incident which i thought would absolutely shut me off from the world. obviously, I'm disgusted by what happened and it was absolutely not consensual. but I feel horny-horny and kinda like i would fuck any sophisticated man who comes to me with a good enough dick.  because i just see them as objects now. no emotions, no feelings, nothing. i shouldn't even be doing this but meh. all i want is a dick to pleasure me and that's not who i am/was. this switch from feeling dead inside for several months... I'm thinking I'm back!",

It's normal to have a high sex drive after being closed off for so long and realizing you're feeling again. I say take it slow and be cautious. If you wouldn't typically do it, don't. Wait it out until you're able to process without all emotional background urges.",

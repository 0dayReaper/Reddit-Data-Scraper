A good friendship would be on equal terms. You should be able to discuss issues and even fight over them without ending your friendship. If you can't, I'd argue it's not a friendship you'd want to be in.\n\nIf he truly is your friend, he'll understand and apologise. You might need to beat it out of him, but you'll get there.\n\nBesides that you owe it to yourself to confront him about it. It'll be great for your mental health. It may not seem like it, but these kinds of things eat away at your self-confidence. You start to feel trapped and like your feelings don't matter. It'll turn you into a shell of a human. I've been there and it's not something you realise you're in until you step out of it.\n\nSometimes in life you need to just say what's on your mind or speak the truth even if there are negative consiquences for doing so. This sounds to me like it's one of those times. Looking after your feelings is not irrational behaviour, in fact I'd argue it's illogical to ignore them. That's my advice for whatever it's worth. Just talk to him and don't be afraid to get angry. Stand your ground.",

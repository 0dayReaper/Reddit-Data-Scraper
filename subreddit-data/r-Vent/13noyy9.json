    "postText": "yesterday morning my dog ended up passing away in my lap on a car ride to her favorite lake. her health had been on a steady decline after the vet found a large mass in her throat that was presumed to be cancerous about a month ago. the last few days she really wasn\u2019t acting like herself at all (lack of appetite, drooling, and attempting to isolate herself in the yard/rooms she had no interest in prior..) so my family and i scheduled her for an in-home euthanasia that was supposed to happen on tuesday. we had just wanted to take her to the lake one last time and she didn\u2019t even make the 40 minute drive. she ended up laying down on me and resting her head on my lap. i assumed she was sleeping but 20 minutes went by until i noticed she was completely unresponsive. she had died and i didn\u2019t even notice right away. it\u2019s eating me up inside because i knew she wasn\u2019t feeling good that morning. i should\u2019ve just went to a vet and had her put down that day but i overestimated her and thought she could hold on until tuesday. i don\u2019t know if i ever will forgive myself. my childhood dog i had for 12 years passed away in 2020. we decided to do an in-home euthanasia for him and everything went smoothly and he passed with honor. i was heartbroken but i was at peace knowing he wasn\u2019t suffering that badly towards the end. but my sweet girl died on me in the car and she deserved so much better than that.",

I\u2019ve experienced in-home euthanasia and it was one of the most painful and awful memories I have. The whole family was waiting for the vet, our dog knew it and despite us trying hard to reassure him he was terrified and really didn\u2019t want to go and yelped at us seemingly asking us not to do it. Absolutely awful. That was 2006. My brother had his family dog put to sleep about a decade ago and I wanted to talk to him about it to try and, I dunno, understand if it was normal or get some closure but he didn\u2019t want to talk about it and I understand why.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss OP but I\u2019m so thankful your little friend drifted away with you next to them.",

Dogs don\u2019t really hide pain, so the fact that you didn\u2019t even notice probably means she passed as peacefully as possible. She wasn\u2019t surrounded by strangers which she would probably prefer. Dogs can also sense emotions and I know it would probably be more stressful for the dog to be surrounded by people that are having anxiety about the situation. So it was probably the best for her, calmly laid on the lap of someone she loves that was also calm the entire time. It\u2019s hard no matter what, no matter what you do it will always feel like you didn\u2019t do \u201cenough\u201d. It\u2019s normal to feel like that at first, but I hope eventually you realize that you did the absolute best for her and she probably really appreciated that.",

The dog layed in your lap and once it finally felt safe and comfortable it left go so if anything you should feel honored that your dog chose you and showed that it really loved you and was comfortable with you. I know how it is so keep ya head up man but don\u2019t get down on yourself to much these things happen and it\u2019s the circle of life. Instead of my dog dying on my lap, I held my grandma on my knees/lap while she took her final breath trying to cook dinner for us. We never know our time to go so we must cherish every second we get. Also had my best friend or brother die last year randomly so this life is tuff but we must remain solid or it will bring us down aswell",

I'm not saying euthanasia isn't painless and peaceful, but sometimes people should also think how scared animals are when it happens. I wish my Marley had died in my lap rather than a doctors office. I was a kid but it hurts cause they ushered us out of the room cause my mom said it would be to painful for me. But in all honesty, he was alone when he died, and I can't forgive myself for that. I have 4 cats now, and one of them is slowly declining in health. If I do an euthanasia, I'm doing it at home where he can be surrounded by the people he loves. Which I'm sure you would have done anyways by what you said. But your dog was in your lap, peaceful, on his way to his favorite park with his person. Ain't no better way to go than that. Death is gonna hurt anyways, but if I'm gonna die, I want it to be like that. And i hope its the same way with my pets. Actually, it reminds me of my uncle's cat. \n\nShe died in his arms just purring away. Heart just gave out in the arms of her best friend. Makes me cry just thinking about it. Her name was Purrty. A nickname given to my mom cause my uncle couldn't say pretty when he was a kid.",

It was an absolutely horrific nightmare and I was so grateful when one vet finally opened a half hour early and I was able to rush her in and set her free. \n\nI\u2019d have given anything for her to have fallen asleep and never woke up in my lap on the way there instead. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and she picked her perfect time to let go.

It\u2019s not your fault that you didn\u2019t notice, it\u2019s just good that she was with you in her last moments, if you were petting her or cuddling up to her then she must\u2019ve had a very peaceful final moments, or if she was even just laying on you, around those she loves most and have taken care of her for her entire life. Don\u2019t blame yourself you didn\u2019t notice she passed, that actually happens a lot, people die while waiting for treatment, that happened to my cousins mom last week. But don\u2019t blame yourself, you gave your dog the best life you could have given her, she passed very peacefully, with those she loves, and a place she loved. Again, sorry for your loss of your pupper, just be happy she was with those she loved and who loved her.",

No matter how hard we tried, doing it in office, they were scared. Obviously, there are times waiting for a home euthanasia isn\u2019t an option but you did the right thing in my book.

She was 93, had taken a nasty fall, and within 2 weeks she had gone from perfectly healthy to hospital to hospice. I was home for something the Saturday she fell, I was told on that Wednesday that I needed to come home that weekend to see her. On that Sunday, she was transported to hospice. I told her on that day that I had decided to come back the next weekend, and though she was super out of it, she acknowledged me leaving and recognized I was coming back. I got in that Thursday, and my mom asked me to stay in hospice with her that night. I got there at noon, by 5 AM she had passed.\n\nI believe the body likes to pass away when it is most comfortable. I\u2019m not sure if I think this way to make myself more at peace with the fact that I was the one there when my grandmother died or what, but it helps me to think that my granny waited until I was there to pass away. Even if it was subconsciously.\n\nYour dog was with the people she loved the most, going to her favorite place, content in your lap. She was so happy. It was one the best last moments you could EVER give her. She was comfortable, and she knew it was time to cross the rainbow bridge. She loves you, and I\u2019m sure that she couldn\u2019t have been happier when she passed.\n\nI know it\u2019s so hard not to feel this guilt. I felt so much guilt when my granny passed while I was with her. But there is no reason to feel guilty. She was happy because she was with you.",

I'll leave it at that since everyone else has said what I thought the way she passed.  \n\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss, but I think the problem you're having is she didn't go out the way you planned. You and the rest of your family didn't get to say your last good-byes. You weren't ready - and honestly you can't really BE READY for when a loved one dies, but the idea it was going to be a specific day gave you closure. Easier to digest the loss that way. I would know; I was the one responsible for having my mother taken off a life-support machine. Having a day sorta... planned for when a loved one goes makes the pain easier. But as others have pointed out; probably your dog would have went out in fear; sensing the anxeity from you all, having a needle put into her, not likely understanding what was happening. This was better for her, maybe not for you; but it was for her.  \n\n\nBe happy that she got the best final moments ANYONE could have asked for. Most of us want to go out happily, with little pain, maybe with someone we love. She got all 3 of those.  \n\n\nYou have my sincerest condolences. I'm low-key anxious for whenever my 2 elderly dogs go. What you're going through is hard, but you will get through it. Remember the good times and how happy you made her and how happy she made you.",

Good dog, didnt realize how big his body was etc and used to knock shit over with his tail.  \n\n\nAnyways we had to move and my then girlfriend said what are we going to do with the dog?  I was kind of confused because this was our responsibility now right...?  \nI figured this dog was going to be a bigger part of my life than this girl so i asked a cousin to watch over him until i could get him again...  \nthe girl and i broke up so i regained the responsibility that i never asked for because...well...we accepted this dog into our life and i couldn't abandon him on a whim or a breakup right  \nWell i took him to a farm and a place where he could just be a dumb goofy dog that he is and then he started just having seisures...its sad but i dont want my dog to suffer right?   So i took him to the vet and they gave him a few shots and said he had a 30% chance to not have anymore seisures.  Anyways he pretty much had seisures all night. by 5 he just seemed done with it all so i took him to the vet......  \n\n\nI helped the vet take him out of my truck but i didnt want to see the outcome so i just kind of knoped out of it right?  \n\n\nWell i'll never forget this dog originally being frantic by the vet but seeing me seemed to calm down,  so i help the vet take him back....But im scared to see what is about to happen right?  \nand?  \n\n\nI will never forget this look because i was probably the only person this dog ever trusted and I was scared because i didnt want to see him die....But this dog was probably terrified because i was all he knew......  \n\n\nI let him get put down without me and i'll never forget him or the regret  \n\n\nI wish he could of died on my lap on the way because i wouldnt have to see that look everytime i think about Apollo",

They'll sometimes wait for that one moment that their loved one steps out of the room, or they'll wait for someone coming from out of town to be there. It's super personal.\n\nAlmost no one prefers to die in a doctor's office or a hospital. Typically, if they do it's only so their loved ones have tons of support in that moment. Again, it's personal, but most want to be home and at peace.\n\nYour pupper got a good death \ud83d\udc97. On a car ride, with your love and comfort right there, that's incredibly beautiful and not something to feel guilty about. They didn't smell your fear or hear your heartbreak, it was easy. Peaceful. \n\nThere's always going to be those 'I should have...if only I hadn't...' type thoughts. I think that's because we want to have control and we analyze to see if there were any possible way to have a different outcome. The thing is tho, it isn't up to us. Whether its up to God or the constructs of chaos, I'm not the one to say. Either way, we're all just visitors. It sounds like your pupper had a really peaceful and loving passing and was at ease enough to just let go. It's quite possible they chose that moment as their last here. There can be a lot of comfort in that, although it is an unbearably painful thing to loose someone you love so much.\n\nMy heart goes out to you and I hope you are able to find some comfort amidst the grief. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97",

A nice peaceful comfortable sleeping passing over the rainbow bridge is way better than the other ways it could have happened. I'm currently struggling with my own pup who has rapid progressive cancer and I hope that's how she goes. I'm so sorry for your loss.",

I really agree with the others on this thread that it must\u2019ve been so comforting for your dog to feel the rhythm of the car and resting on your warm lap, being with her person \ud83d\udc9cmust\u2019ve felt really peaceful as your dog slipped away over the rainbow bridge. Please don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. It was a beautiful intention to bring her to the lake and it sounds like your dog went peacefully in your presence.",

Not to tell you what to do, but I hope that helps you not feel guilty. She went naturally and peacefully with you. \nI always found putting a dog down because they were suffering to be humane, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she was struggling. She just went peacefully. It sounds like a beautiful way to die to me. I hope you find peace",

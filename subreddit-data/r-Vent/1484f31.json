    "postText": "Before people come in and say \"you should leave them\" neither of us are in a situation where leaving is going to help. And I don't want to leave them. I just want help on how to tackle it.\n\nThey left their last very very nice job after a year because they couldn't handle the people interaction anymore. Thier Psych is pretty sure they have autism and ADHD. They were on short term disability for a while but that ran out and they tried to get long term. They were denied. \nNow by the time this was happening my last job was literally shit. Between trying to take care of them and trying to keep a small business a float practicaly all by myself I was very close going to the mental ward myself. (Which was not helped by my partner literally disappearing one night and having to call the cops to find them)\n\nI have since quit that job and found a MUCH better one, but my partner is still jobless. I used to say they did house work but that's turning into a lie. The most they do is the dishes because I stopped. (They kept complaining about how I did them so I stopped all together)\nOtherwise they play video games all day and sleep. They will go out shopping but they rarely seem to do it on their own.(they will pick me up from work and then go)\n\nThey were supposed to do our garden and it's still a mess. I work full-time and while I love my new job, I still want to come home and relax. \nIf they were working I wouldn't be complaining about it, but they aren't. They have no job and they really haven't been looking. \n\nAnd like...I wouldnt be so fucking annoyed if they just did something! I miss my partner, I miss having the fun we used to have. But I feel like they've chosen thier video games and shit over us. They don't write anymore, they don't draw. They don't have the passion they used to and it hurts. \n\nAnd like I don't want to leave them, but it does leave me yearning for what we had. \nI'm tired of walking on eggshells too. Constantly I feel like they take more offense to what I have to say recently. They get into moods where I feel like I can't win so I just kinda stop talking to them. And it cycles back into I feel like I'm walking on eggshells\n\nI know part of this is mental illness, but at what point does it stop being just the illness and become selfish laziness?",

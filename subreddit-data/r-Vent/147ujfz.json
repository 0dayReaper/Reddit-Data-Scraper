    "postText": "I hate my family dynamic sometimes. I hate how at every turn as a child the adults put themselves first.\n\n-Cheating\n-Alcoholism\n-Emotional Abuse\n-Forcing another woman into my life who was just so insanely toxic. \n-And so much more.\n\nIts just so hard to forgive when they make your emotions such a focal point. Its one thing to admit when you fuck up. I can respect that. We can at least move on from that.\n\nIts another thing to insist upon your own infalability and insist that another person change their feelings so that you can feel better about a situation that you caused. \n\nThat's the thing adults forget. Its scary to be a kid. You can't just go and fuck some other woman and force that woman into your child's life and expect it to be all good.",

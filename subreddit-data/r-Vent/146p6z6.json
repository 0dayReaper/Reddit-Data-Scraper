    "postText": "I was interning at a dog grooming place and my employer bought me a milkshake. The delivery boy came in, and he was so startled by a dog barking just once that he threw the milkshake across the room. Then he left without even apologizing or offering a refund. I was quite mad, it really reminded me of that scene from VeggieTales where Jimmy the pizza delivery guy got away with eating Larry's pizza. Thankfully, my employer got me a new milkshake (though as far as I know, the delivery guy got off scot-free).",

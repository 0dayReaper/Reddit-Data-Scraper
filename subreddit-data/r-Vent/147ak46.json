    "postText": "I am a medical receptionist and have been a med receptionist for 3 years. At a new place im working I have a contract that when i do insurance authorizations, my wage will go up by 50 cents an hour. Ive been learning insurance authorizations for four months and definitely have done a good number of them by now and i should be getting paid more based on the contract. Im moving out of my parents house and made a word document with my budget plan. Basically with how much im making now, living on rice and beans im still living paycheck to paycheck. I brought up the raise with my office manager. The word document with my budget fell out of my pocket when i got up to go to the bathroom. She handed me the paper that she found when i came back and i knew that she read it. Then she coldly told me that i wouldnt get the raise for the new few weeks. I smiled and nodded then started applying for new jobs as soon as her head was turned.",

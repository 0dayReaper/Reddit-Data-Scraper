    "postText": "short story is that i drunkly kissed sb else while i was with my bf. it was a few months ago i regret it so much and accept full responsibility for my actions and have done a complete 180 of my ways. im doing everything in my power to be the best i can be for my bf. but he is honestly not appreciating me at all. he decided to forgive me but i dont think he ever did. out of the blue he would ignore me all day insult me leave home etc. he doesnt do anything for me and he takes me for granted. any argument comes up he pulls the card that i cheated. its like i dont have any right about feelings or opinions. ive been enduring it since i know i hurt him a lot and i was ready for this and i have been taking it. but lately its been getting to me. all of my effort to save this relationship and make him happy. it seems worthless. i have given up on my friends (it was his demand) i have given up any social life i had i have given up all my hobbies, everything that i like for him. ive never felt so alone. he is never there for me to support me when i need him. it feels so one sided. i know ive done a terrible thing but i\u2019ve learned from it and i dont ever do it again - me and my bf have suffered enough. it feels heavy to be the only one carrying this relationship. i feel terrible about myself and i think about ending my life sometimes. he doesnt want to communicate either. is he punishing me? its hard for me to put it into words.",

Even if you had no intention of doing it, it still happened and was a conscious decision you made. Now I understand you know this and aren't denying it, but it's still not easy to accept for a partner.\n\nIt's clear that the cheating isn't something your BF can get over. Even though he wanted to continue the relationship, his actions are totally different from what he's said. The best thing would have been for you both to break up. The relationship isn't going to heal if he doesn't want it anymore. He'll hold this over you for as long as possible. You can only do so much to show you're sorry and regret what happened, but eventually it will eat away at you, and then you'll stop putting any effort in as well. \n\nIt's time to move on from each other and do better with the next one.",

Your mistake was of course the cheating however you have done whatever is needed to make up for it but its not enoughfor him. His mistake was thinking that he could continue to be in this relationship and move on from the cheating \n\nI get you don't want to have to move on but unfortunately that ship has sailed. Some things can't be mended and this relationship is one of them, but you know now what you've done wrong and I'm sure you will do whatever you can to not do it again.\n\nDisclaimer: for love of all that is holy, do not think that a child can fix this relationship either.

Learn from your mistakes in a new relationship with someone else.\n\nEven just a kiss, most people aren't equipped to deal with that. I know how it feels. Every time he looks at you he sees the other dude on you. That's just how it is.\n\nThe moment you cheat the relationship is ruined. No matter how much you cheated, how far it went, what the circumstances were, none of that matters. It will never be the same. \n\nWhat you got to do is let him go. Set him free because he's obviously not able to do it himself.\n\nYou're not a horrible person entirely nor are you doomed to be a horrible person for the rest of your life. But you messed up, you messed up your relationship. No one else. \n\nHe probably still loves you so it's hard for him to let go. But it's never going to be okay again. It just doesn't work that way. Takes a very special person to get over that kind of betrayal, to truly get over it and release any feelings of spite that you may have.\n\nYou got to be the bigger person here.",

Can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nYou can have some semblance of self esteem and send the cheater away, or you can be a little sadboy and take her back. Sounds like he's trying to do both",

Don't contact him again. Go 30-day no contact if he tries to contact you\n\nHe can either take your departure as a wake up call, and show you that he wants to work it out.

But if both of you decided to keep the relationship together. Then he\u2019s gotta buck up and make it work with you together. Plain and simple. There\u2019s only so much you can take until you feel hopeless. \n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t in a good head space when the cheating occurred and I really don\u2019t think losing friendships or hobbies you love are all to blame from your commitment to your boyfriend. It probably has shaped you better to cut some negative things out of your life. And that can become very lonely, but I don\u2019t think blaming your boyfriend is a good move. You said you\u2019ve done a 180 yourself. \n\nI would say just continue focusing and finding hobbies and interests that define you. Don\u2019t try to be dependent and please your boyfriend every waking second for validation because of the cheating thing. Your going to be left with nothing and probably if the relationship ends go back to some old habits.\n\nJust ask him plain out, is there a future together. If he says yeah, then tell him he\u2019s gotta give and start working with you. If he can\u2019t put his differences aside from what happened and openly talk about how hurt he feels. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t control or fix. It comes from within.",

I'm a 16 year old transgender gay guy and I'm also ugly as all hell\n\n\nEver since I was like 5, my mom kept telling me how fat and ugly I am and then brushing it off as her being \"concerned for my health\". I know I'm not unhealthy as my bmi seems to check out and last time I checked I only weigh 54kg (I'm 163cm tall for reference). She's also always told me that being trans \"isn't a real thing\" and how I'm \"faking it\" but I know what I'm feeling is real and I've had enough. \n\n\nI've never been good enough for my parents physically or whatever else and it's just enough \n\n\nI want to starve myself. I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I swear to god I'm gonna if thats what I need to do to be thin like all the attractive boys in my school and town.\nI wanna be like them. They're all so handsome and I wish I could be like them but no matter how much I exercise or how little I eat I'm still fat and ugly and it makes me want to die\n\n\nAnd I can't tell my friends about this either because they all have their own bucket load of shit to deal with, not to mention how one of them threatened to abandon me despite knowing I have abandonment issues last time it was brought up\n\n\nI can't handle this anymore",

            "comment": "No offence intended, but your mum sounds like a bitch. No mother should start telling their child they're ugly. I understand health concerns but the way u described it just doesn't make sense. \n\nAs far as the trans thing, I personally don't really conform to it. I just see male and female and that's it. And again I'm not saying that to offend.\n\n However, and this is a big however, let everyone do what they want. It's no reason to disrespect someone. The fact she's saying you're faking it and stuff like that is just terrible. If I had a kid and they came out as trans, I certainly wouldn't talk to them like that about it. You have every right to identify as whatever it is you identify as and for a mother to talk to you like that is a bit cruel imo. And that friend who threatened to abandon you doesn't sound like much of a friend.\n\nI can say with complete certainty that you judge your own looks much harsher than other people judge it. We all think like this. Myself included. A great example I think of is photos. You know when you see a photos of yourself and you see some as better than others depending on your angles and stuff like that? Well have you ever thought that about other people in those photos? Probably not. You dont see all their tiny flaws. You just see them for them. \n\nI can guarantee that there are people who think you look amazing. It took me years to actually see myself in a good light but after I did, I felt so much better. And after becoming confident, it only made myself as a whole even better. You can do the same. I know its not easy. But each time you leave your house, do it with confidence and good things will come your way. Hopefully, you'll feel better soon.",

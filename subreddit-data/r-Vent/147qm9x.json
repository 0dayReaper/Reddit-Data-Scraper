    "postText": "So i found out i lost my id card, and proceeded to walk through every place i was yesterday to see if they had it but no one said they did. So i had to get a passport immediately because i had exams soon (and in my country we're required to show ID before entering) so i had to pay around 150 euros to get that all done.\n\nI visited one of the stores i visited earlier for groceries and they said they had my card... the whole day. And they just didn't think to give it back to me when i asked for it that morning. I'm feeling so screwed up by them right now, it's a lot of money and they just told me 'can't do anything about that'",

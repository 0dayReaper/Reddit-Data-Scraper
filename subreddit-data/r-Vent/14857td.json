I was leaving a place and accidentally hit the window down button and it dropped like 1/2 a centimetre. Not too big a deal. \n\nI pull into a parking lot, and was successfully pulling it back up. When out of nowhere, this 50something woman comes out of nowhere, and goes \u201clet me help you\u201d, pushes and holds the window down button.  \n\nI can now feel the entire weight of the window held inbetween my two hands. \n\nI try to say \u201cno ma\u2019am don\u2019t, I have it under control\u201d when she keeps pushing the button. Then starts to punch the inside of the passenger door like that would fix it. \n\nI have to let go of the window to try and get her away, and as soon as I do, the entire thing just slurps right down into the door. \n\nShe then says in the most asshole tone possible \u201cI was trying to help\u201d and walks away. \n\nThis happened in like, less than 5 fucking seconds, and by the time my brain caught up with everything, she was completely fucking gone. \n\nAnd now, I just finished taping a garage bag to my window and trying to figure out what this even qualifies under for insurance, if it qualifies at all. \n\nI am so fucking mad. I had it under control. I was in the middle of fixing it, and this person never asked if i needed help or anything close to that. Just fucking \u201cbutton push\u201d, and im the asshole. \n\nFucking fuck.",

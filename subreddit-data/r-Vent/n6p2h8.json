But they knew they had this and we're dealing with the symptoms before they turned at very latest fifteen. \n\nSo they could have just known that their fiancee had such an illness. Cystic fibrosis can take someone real young. Lots of transplants too, not saying it was that but it's a real rough one to live with.\n\nAnd to stand by someone, love someone with any of these kinds of struggles. That takes a lot...",

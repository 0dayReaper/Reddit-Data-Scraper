There's this whole media and romantization of people getting anxious and working so hard they forget to eat, they get skinny and this is called beautiful. Meanwhile I swallow 3 sandwiches in dive minutes like it's nothing, it's shit, Idk why it's so frustrating to not be aesthetic.",

I'm chubby, but I've never weighted more than 71 kilos. My parents yelled at me at the market when I asked for sweets for Christmas, I was constantly criticized about my portions during lunch and dinner even if I picked the same amount as everyone, I was called a fat short sausage by a doctor and I've been dieting ever since I was 7.\n I just hate how everything around food is, I hate how I have an emotional breakdown and eat sugar until I get sick and then not eat for the next 3 days so I'm able to \"compensate\". I wish I would just forget to eat when I'm anxious because eating later would just be so much easier. I pretty much relate on feeling like I have no self worth, it's like I'm this inhumane eating monster.",

Even now, my mom still bullies me over my weight because now I am actually \"overweight\" according to BMI. Even though it's actually because of my muscle mass and I'm clearly not fat whatsoever, she still criticizes me whenever I eat anything unhealthy or in large amounts. Please, don't let your parents' words get to you. You're not fat (71 kg isn't even a weight I'd consider chubby), they're just being assholes.",

Especially if the shakes are only like 150 calories. I can walk off 150 calories. And since it's protein it helps keep you fuller, for longer. Don't drink 2 within 2 hours of each other, you'll get the protein farts. But, I used to have 1 for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Really help curb the over eating. \n\nAlso, kept has helped me a lot. Though it's a tad expensive to keep up and it's hard if you live with your parents. A lot of cooking in the kitchen. \n\nThe important thing for you to learn is, every day is a new day to try. You're going to fail some times. That's just part of life. The important thing is that you're not lying to yourself about it. It's ok to admit \"yep, today was not a good day for my diet\" but, you always have tomorrow to be better. Also, cutting calieries is tough to do cold turkey. Your body is used to you scarfing down 3 sandwiches. It's going to be expecting 3. You have to ease your body off of it. \n\nJust remember, mind power is stronger than will power. You got this!!",

I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m not helpful in a project or picked last because I look weak as fuck.

After dealing with an ulcer, I decided I need to do something about my eating. I\u2019ve started to take vitamins and exercise daily. My eating has improved a fair bit since the beginning of the month and in super pumped to keep this up.",

I find myself being sick often even from 1 meal a day now because it\u2019s too hard for me to eat now. I don\u2019t feel that much skinnier(though my family seems to think I am), still get people who won\u2019t shut up about my weight behind me and I have to act emotionless to hope people leave me alone only to have someone else do it. Sorry for venting about that but need to because I feel like I\u2019m going to accidentally snap one day.",

There's nothing fun about forgetting/ignoring the need to eat for so long that you get nauseated, or when people mistake the consequences of your ED for consequences of drug use..\nWe're all beautiful and our bodies, are beautiful organic computers. For the most part, they regulate themselves and know when sustenance is needed. We should eat if we feel hungry, and stop if we feel full.

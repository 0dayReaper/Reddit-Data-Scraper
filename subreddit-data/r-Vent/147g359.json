    "postText": "\n\n\n\nSo when I created my Microsoft account, I used my old and only email address at the time. I no longer use that email and have updated the settings to use my newer email, however, no matter how many times I try to delete my old email, it doesn't do so.  \n\nWhenever I sign in and have an issue, it requests to send a code to my old email. \n\nI am so freaking tired of it and I just don't know how to solve it. Does anyone have any idea on how I can permanently remove that old email... no matter what I do Microsoft just refuses to remove it. Thanks!",

    "postText": "I love my mom, i genuinely do but i honestly just dont know what to do anymore. I can\u2018t even trust her anymore, with anything. She also has a habit of lying for no reason. She ALWAYS sleeps during the day, and when i say always i literally mean every single day (maybe with 1-2 exceptions a month.) And honestly, if she actually woke up instead of lying i\u2018d be okay with it. She always tells me to wake her up at a specific time, i do, and she yells at me. I don\u2018t, and she gets disappointed in me. (When she yells at me she most likely won\u2018t wake up.)\n\nAnd right now she\u2018s at my grandma\u2018s house for picking up some food since we have some money issues and couldn\u2018t get food today. She went at like 8pm and now its almost 12pm. Mind you, my grandma\u2018s house isn\u2018t that far away (probably a 30-40min walk), and she PROMISED she would only get the food, maybe smoke a cigarette and leave. And i\u2018m sorry but that shit can NOT take that long. \n\nI\u2018m in a lot of anxiety due to school tommorow and i have problems with finishing school work on my own, i just need someone by my side or i just cant do it. I also have a lot of anxiety attacks in general due to school/school work. And she PROMISED ME SHE WOULD HELP ME.\n\nI just honestly dont know what to do anymore except cry. We don\u2018t have food, my dad\u2018s angry at my mom bcs she\u2018s not home yet, i think im about to have another anxiety attack and i dont know what to do anymore. I just need someone to comfort me for once in my life i cant handle all of this loneliness anymore. My dad\u2018s always at work, my mom\u2018s either asleep or somewhere else, and my friends all live too far away. I know, or atleast i want to believe, that my mom\u2018s trying her best but idk what to do anymore. My Dad doesnt really care about me, or atleast im not one of his priorities. So my mom\u2018s really the only one i got, and i feel sad that she just plays with my trust like that all the time.\n\n(I\u2018m 14 btw, so i cant just move out or something, but honestly i dont even think moving out would help my problems.)",

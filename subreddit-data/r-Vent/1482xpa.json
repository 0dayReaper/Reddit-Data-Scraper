    "postText": "i\u2019m 17 and shes 16 shes a year younger than me and i did a ta for her class last semester and we didn\u2019t talk much for the first month but i started talking to her more because she was one of the most beautiful people i\u2019ve ever seen, we started talking and then we started to talk hours every day facetiming at night. she started to compliment me, how she loves my hair or my smile or how nice i am and stuff and so i asked her out because i had feeling back and she friendzoned me, honestly i was fine with being in the friendzone because she was literally my bestfriend but i wouldn\u2019t ever say no if she wanted more, a few months later we had a school dance for valentine\u2019s day i was trying to get over her because i didn\u2019t think it was gonna go any farther than friends at the time, one night we were on facetime like usual and she asked me to go w her \u201cto see what people would think\u201d i joked with her saying oh yea you flirting w me? and she said no don\u2019t take it like that so we just continued our facetime then she said \u201ci just wanna be loved\u201d i said yea i feel that me too and then she said \u201cyk we should just date\u201d and it really never went anywhere but i wish that it did. we didn\u2019t end up going to the dance together i went with my other friend and that didn\u2019t go anywhere either and now the girl i was in love with is now dating her ex who cheated on her and blocked me on insta and unadded me on snap. i\u2019m honestly heartbroken and i miss her so much.\ni went to therapy to talk about her and a lot of other problems that she helped with but she\u2019s gone now right so it\u2019s horrible again and the doctor diagnosed me w depression and some of the reason i have it is because of her.\n\ni miss calling her while i\u2019m walking home from work at 2 am, i miss being on facetime with her, i miss her compliments, i miss her laugh, i miss her smile (she doesn\u2019t genuinely smile often but when she does it\u2019s to die for), i miss her voice so much i could listen to her talk constantly it\u2019s soothing and it just makes me happy\ni genuinely just miss her so much",

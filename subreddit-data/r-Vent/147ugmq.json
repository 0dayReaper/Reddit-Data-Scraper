    "postText": "I just need to get his off my chest. I used to live with my mum back in the states about three years ago, and she was dating a Colombian actor who was living with us in the house. After some months, he starts getting verbally abusive, and starts gambling away all her money. That situation was horrible, he would scream at her for hours and I feel red, I wanted to kill the guy. He threatened me a couple of times, and was jacked as hell, and I'm not insane so I never did, but now years later I still go into a blind fury whenever I think back on it, like silent screaming and imagining myself committing violent acts against him, won't go into details but it's horrid stuff. A part of me regrets not picking up a knife or gun and threatening the guy with his life to never come back, I feel weak not having done anything and it enrages me to this day. I hate people like him, no reason gives you justification to hurt or abuse another person. I'm still trembling and sweating after having gone through another bout as I write this, I'm going to talk to my therapist about it, I don't want to feel like this anymore. Flagging this as NSFW and triggering content as I don't know if it qualifies. ",

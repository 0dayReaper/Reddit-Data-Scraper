We want others to love and accept us so bad but we don\u2019t even love and accept us lol!\n\nWe literally dictate to each other every day about who black and who not, and it\u2019s such an irritating thing, like how tf you mad at a random person with pale skin but same day you in your community tearing your people down bc YOU decide who they are not???\n\nTf???\n\nI been bullied by black people for not being black enough my whole life, like black people only accept the ones they deem black, the ones who coincidentally fit all the stereotypes of being black. Like it\u2019s so hard to explain but the love in our community is conditional af to each other. \n\nLike as a black woman you are expected to have this great banging body, an ass that sticks out and is round, some nice juicy hips, and thick lips, and you supposed to talk a certain way and walk a certain way and look a certain way, you suppose to be able to dance, throw down and cook, braid hair,, etc etc but not having these things makes you a white woman, like it\u2019s such a crazy concept, bc who tf said a white woman can\u2019t naturally have that bubble ass? who tf said white women can\u2019t cook?? can\u2019t dance??? like I\u2019m sick of my people gatekeeping dumb shit but no one calls us out bc you know slavery ig??? \n\nand then as a black person in general it\u2019s weird for you to like books, weird for you to like music that doesn\u2019t involve killing and being a hoe wit 2 girls, it\u2019s WHITE for us to be smart af, WHITE for us to stay at home and keep to ourselves, white this white that \n\nlike wtf that\u2019s literally hate towards black people who are different for literally jus being us and it\u2019s hypocritical af because why are you calling something WHITE? Why are you calling something that\u2019s a part of someone personality a RACE like it\u2019s bad or dishonorable or whatever?? Like these things are just somehow racially exclusive??? How is it different than someone expecting an Asian to be smart af with ten degrees before their middle school graduation, like. but let a white person call something \u201cblack\u201d. \n\nNobody calls us out on this shit bc again, slavery blah blah. \n\nSome black people are just as filled with ego racism and bs as the rest of the world. I hate it. This is like a decade of holding this in ngl. But I feel the most unloved by my people truly.",

The biggest observation that I see daily is that Black culture here has become linear in that as a black person, you are not allowed to be different or act different. You must fit a certain mold or force to be ostricized by other blacks. For example, one of my best friends growing up is black, and he LOVES Ska music and skateboards and wanted to be a banker. However, his biggest adversary was other black people, especially his family who berated him and called him white and other demeaning things all because he didn't like rap music or need the latest Jordans and Fubu wear. This guy was going places, and his biggest worry in life is being exiled by those who are supposed to love and support him because he doesn't follow their culture. I see an entire generation being bullied to fit a certain mold to fit in, and it's heartbreaking because the world is so big and full of cultures that are so welcoming. Just my 2 cents. Sometimes, we can be our own worst enemy.",

I know it's easier said than done for myself since I'm white, but long ago I just gave up completely on what any kind of \"community\" might think about me or how I'm \"supposed\" to be acting. I don't give a fuck about sports, I think MMA is stupid, I don't care about the gym, I don't blame all society's problems on immigrants/women/poor people/etc...,I don't care about guns, I don't go to church, I don't enjoy gawking at and harassing women, I actually support every minority/marginalized community's right to exist and figure out their own shit, etc... So generally among your average 40-something white guy in-group, I'm something of a pariah. And it's been this way forever. I'm a 6-figure white collar IT guy now and it was the same shit when I was a teenager in a blue collar neighborhood working in a warehouse.\n\nPeople largely just have very entitled sensibilities about what everyone should be doing, and it's really off-putting. Just be happy being you and get used to the idea that if that means you'll be more alone, so be it. Better to be alone with your integrity than compromise who you are just to fit in better with the kind of people who would demand that of you.\n\nThere are good people out there, they're just hard to come by.

But I want to remind you that ever since systems and narratives have been put into place that were designed to enforce exactly those stereotypes you speak off as well. Not just white people were forced to hear them repeatedly but everyone else as well. That ultimately lead to minorities (unconsciously or consciously) believing parts of them, not all but some. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that you and the people you are referring to are all victims of racism and stereotyping. Does that make things easier for you? No, but maybe it helps you understand/reminds you that your community is divided because of racism. Keep doing what you're doing, be kind to yourself.  With more people not feeding into the divide maybe in a few years or the next generation things will improve.\n\nSorry, if this is out of place for me.

Maybe it's just the loud minority and I don't like to generalise but some of the most racist people I've ever met have been black. I've seen and experienced true hate and disgust from black people for nothing more than being white. I've been friends with POC and seen the colourism that exists towards their own community too. That's not to say that white people aren't racist. There are racists of every ethnicity I believe. \n\nA lot of white people are constantly conscious of our actions in regards to race and ethnicity. Yes, true racists do exist that don't care but the majority of us are not that way. Simply being born white is enough to be labelled a racist these days.  Black people definitely seem to get away with so much more and are protected by mainstream media. A POC says \"kill all white people\", \"crackers deserve to die\", \"white people are all just hypersensitive racists\", \"crackers don't have a culture\" and nobody bats an eye. Even the lesser stereotypes like white people can't cook, or white people can't dance ect. If a white person said those things to a POC they would probably get jumped. They'd at least lose their job and their name would be slandered. As they should. It's a horrible thing to say. The problem is that there is a double standard and if you try to talk about it you're racist too.",

It's turned into a real hatred for my own people. We come to this country and all we do is bring the same toxic backwards antiquated ideals with us.  I've also been told MANY times that I sound white too. Like, I'm sorry I speak with proper grammar and pronounce all my syllables. My parents were immigrants and I am first generation American. They moved us out of that toxic community in an effort to DO BETTER.\n\nSorry, not trying to hijack but oh man, do I feel this with every fiber of my being. All we can do is continue living our best lives and let the bitter people stay in their corner.",

It's a very insightful read that talks about this.",

Instead of playing the victim and pointing fingers wouldn't it be more productive for people to look within and take some personal responsibility for their opinions, beliefs and actions?",

There's only so much you can do as an individual when the issue is systematic.\n\nOP keeps saying it's about \"their people\", as if it's an inherent issue among black people. There is a long history of stereotyping black people that was invented by a system made to discriminate against them.",

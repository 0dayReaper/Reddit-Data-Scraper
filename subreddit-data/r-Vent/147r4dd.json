At one point during the school year, a upperclassman guy would yell things like \"Hey Babe\" at me and call me \"Babe\" and stuff in the hallways. At one point, they started saying that my legs turn them on. I know it'd not a big deal but I've been affected by the comments and am insecure about a lot and the comments just feeds into my insecurities.",

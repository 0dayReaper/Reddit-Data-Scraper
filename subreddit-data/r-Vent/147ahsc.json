    "postText": "Sorry if this isn\u2019t too clear, I\u2019ve been crying non stop since last night. For clarification, I\u2019m 17, I\u2019ve got one year of high school left. He turns 19 next week, and just finished his first year of university. (I\u2019ve also never dated anyone, not even a first kiss)\n\nI\u2019ve liked him for months. I\u2019ve never met someone that I have so much in common with. Honestly, I\u2019ve only caught feelings for two people in my life, him being one of them. \n\nI know he liked (likes?) me too, he\u2019s told his band mates about me, hell we even saw a movie together despite knowing my age.\n\nLast night after a show, us and some friends went out, he drove us home, and as we were pulling up to my house I told him how I felt. Of course he already knew but I still wanted him to hear it from me. He basically said he had feelings for me too but the age gap made him a bit uncomfortable. \n\nThe age difference itself doesn\u2019t seem bad, but I can understand why someone whose about to start their 2nd year of university would feel weird dating someone about to start their last year of high school.\n\nI\u2019ve felt like shit all day, the worst part being that we both feel something but can\u2019t really do anything about it. I never catch feelings so I know it\u2019ll take me a long time to get over him.\n\nI just hope we can still be close even if it\u2019s not a romantic thing. Plus, the good thing about time is I\u2019ll get older. If we\u2019re friends by next April, maybe we\u2019ll get more chances to get to know one another and be a little more than friends.",

Our opinion doesn't matter to them. \nPeople in Ukraine, you are strong. If any Ukrainian is reading this, I want to say that I am truly sorry. \nRussian and Ukrainian people are not enemies. We were never supposed to be enemies. Now so many people are suffering from the doings of our shitty government we didn't even choose. They are all just a bunch of liars and cowards. The TV is full of lies and propaganda. They are trying to hide the truth from Russian people. Cops are arresting everyone who is protesting. Just HOW can you beat up a person who is protesting AGAINST THE WAR? \nI just want to live normally. Without the war that government of MY country started. Without this meaningless and stupid war. I am fucking terrified to live here, but it isn't comparable to the fear of Ukrainian people right now. \nStay safe, everyone. I hope we can end this madness together.",

Just remember you are your own entity your own mind. YOU are not your government and YOU did not choose to start this war. So it is not your fault.",

As a mass of individuals, it is impossible for them all to be conscious and not to have at least one believe in a higher power. but on solely the individual level, one can decide such a search is useless.\n\nDo we naturally seek to understand the world around us? Yes. But theorists aren\u2019t searching for God, they are searching for knowledge, they are searching for a sound explanation of the universe. They are searching for an understanding\n\nIf that\u2019s what you mean by a higher power, then yes, everyone is in some way seeking to understand the world around themselves. \n\nBut the way I see it, Religion is the easy answer to a difficult set of questions. It exists because it gave rulers great power. If everyone believes in some being, and you claim it blessed you with the authority over everyone, the people will follow that claim because there is nothing to combat it. As long as the harvests yielded food for the masses and the society did not succumb to some unfortunate circumstance, what reason did anyone have to question such a claim? If the gods were unhappy with the ruling, they would make it known. This is in the eyes of the masses.\n\nBeyond that, religion has been handed down, morphed from stories handed down. The Great Flood was likely a local flooding in and around the Mediterranean. Biblical significance was added when the area became somewhat consistently monotheistic.\n\nIt is a habit of humans to search for answers, but when one can\u2019t understand the complexity of one\u2019s world, one chooses religion, because that\u2019s simple enough for any fool to grasp. Who made the world? God did. What is God? We can\u2019t understand him. No human can.",

But to be honest, until we as a species put our foot down on the powerful elites playing war games for cash - nowhere is safe.\n\n***War = Money***\n\nEdit: Just want to point out I never claimed Russia is currently officially communist. I think some people are making some quick assumptions without reading the comment.\n\nWhat downvotes fail to understand is that although the soviet union is not communist today, its choice to do so prior to its fall has lasting effects which continue today. But if you want a modern description - Dr Cog Science said it all.\n\nDownvoting doesn't change the fact Russia is in the situation they are right now in part after allowing communism to take root in its nation decades ago. Just flipping a switch and claiming to \"not be communist anymore\" doesn't actually matter.",

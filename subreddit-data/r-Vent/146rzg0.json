    "postText": "I was the first out of us 2 to get my driving licence, therefore everytime we'd go out, for a solid month or 2, I'd always be the one driving. I didn't feel the need to ask for gas money or stuff like that because eventually he'd be the one driving for a bit when he gets his licence and its gonna even out. After a month or so of chauffeuring him, he was like \"Bro as soon as I get my paycheck, imma give u $100 for all the times you've driven me etc.\" and i was like, nah its cool bro, we're friends, you're gon drive at some point and thats it. \n\nHe was hella lenient on that promise, but the type of person he is, I knew he was just talking out of his ass to make himself feel like he's doing a good thing and I knew I'd never see that money (ofc I didn't). Fast forward to when he got his licence, I felt like I was the one driving at least 80% of the time still. Felt a bit dumb mentioning it knowing it'd prolly make the situation a bit awkward so from that point on, every time we'd go out, I'd make excuses how my parents took the car or I got no gas etc. It became apparent to me that he's cheap asf even tho his car has 3x better economy than mine and for $20, he can comfortably drive for a few weeks to town and back while I'd only be able to go 3-4 times. \n\nNow comes the interesting part. My car's registration expired, therefore I couldn't drive it until it was registered again. Its been unregistered for a solid 2-3 weeks now. In those 3 weeks, we'd gone out a solid 10 times, and not fucking once did he offer to drive. His car was in his backyard, sitting there while he suggested we take the bus each time. Before anyone pities him, he gets scholarship money from a company that his dad works at, every month, and he also works, so he's not broke at all. We both went to the same college except I dropped out and he stayed just to get that scholarship even tho he doesn't even go to college anymore. He's gonna dropout as soon as they stop giving him that financial help. He's in every possible way more financially stable than me and I just got a job 3-4 days ago with only like $30-40 in my bank account. I feel ashamed to even ask my parents for any type of money at this age, and even tho they say I should ask whenever I need it, I still dont feel right doing it.\n\nI was ready to snap at one point when we were agreeing on a time to go out (we both had our cars at the time) and prior to that we didn't have an agreement about who would drive, but 5-10 minutes before we were about to leave, he was like \"I'm ready, I'll wait in front of my house\", at that point I was hella pissed, he basically just made it a norm for me to drive even though we didnt even say who'd be driving today. I just had to be petty asf and I said \"Bro, you gon be waiting for nothing then cause I don't have my car today, I didn't say I was gonna drive\", to which he obviously responded with \"well, i dont have my car too, bla bla\" so we agreed on taking the bus even tho I had the car, I just didnt wanna give him the pleasure of being an ass and still getting what he wants. Just for fucks, I went the longer route to the bus station which passes by his house, and I wasn't surprised to see his car in the backyard lmao.\n\nThis is probably the most vividly explainable story I have about his cheapness but there's a lot more to it and its just so embarrassing to listen to him talk about his \"lack of money\" with no shame of how he portrays himself to me. He basically tells me about his other friends and how he lies when they ask for money saying he doesn't have it or he already borrowed it to someone and stuff, because he doesn't wanna be anyone's red cross, even though I know he lies to me as well lmao, its pretty astounding how he thinks I cant connect the dots at this point. \n\nHe's also a super hypocrite, he talks about how one of our friends is a huge simp but he lacks basic self awareness and doesn't understand that he acts exactly the same every time he gets a new girl (none of the relationships live more than 2 months).\n\nIts almost like anything he does in life is to prove something, we'll be talking about something random and he'd somehow connect his relationship to that topic even tho there's no correlation. I'm in a 6 month relationship myself but I barely talk about it unless its the topic at hand, he just finds any little space to mention it, or mention his plans for the day with her even tho literally no one asked. It's the same with his jobs too, he tries so hard to prove that his job is better than mine even tho I know like 20 people that worked at that company and they're all miserable, they make you think its all nice and dandy at the start until they start fucking with you and make you work for minimal wage with extreme discipline. Its just sad, I know he's my friend but his thirst for validation is insane, especially when he's trying to prove some things to me even though I've known him for so long and I know half the things he says if not even more, are not true, he's a pathological liar, he literally lies about things that dont even make sense to lie about. He has this overwhelming urge to hype people up about something just to make it seem like he's on a good track in life, and it always ends in \"something came up, im not gonna be able to do this, but...\" and then he makes another bold claim which also never happens and it just goes in circles. Unfortunately he lacks self awareness and his ego is huge, anyone I've known feels the same way about him and I'm just wondering, at what point will he gain that self awareness or is he just going to remain ignorant and egotistical until it becomes the death of him.\n\nI remember when he worked at a cafe which was like just starting out, and he was among the first 10 people to work there, but when people ask him about his jobs, he says \"I opened a cafe, I brought the first traffic\" etc. when in reality, he worked there for a semi-miserable paycheck and now to compensate for that, he says he opened it himself lmao. If the boss of that cafe heard him, he'd slap him across the mouth.\n\nAnyways thats pretty much what I had on my mind for now, apologies to everyone for strangling yall with this novel of a story, its just that one thing lead to another and even tho it was supposed to be a short paragraph, i got carried away and started saying more stuff that I remembered, ty for listening\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

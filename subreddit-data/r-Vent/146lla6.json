    "postText": "My life is so bad and there are never any good times.\n\nI'm lost and confused all the time. I think about my life right now and I hate it. There are some parts that are ok but those ok parts are part of a larger shitty bit. \n\nI currently part own a company, yay for me right? Well it's struggling and as director if it fails I'm the one that is liable and responsible for repaying debt, even though I have a business partner that makes deals without my knowledge and misuses funds. \n\nMy home life is where it is really bad. My wife is not for me. When we met it was a mutual need thing to enter into a relationship but we became stuck. I have a problem (probably narcissism) where I feel like I have to help people and I can't leave them because they will be hurt. She was struggling financially and I needed help with getting my kids to school, we had been dating 3 months and she moved in. She didn't hit it off with my eldest daughter, 8 when they met, and that relationship became really hostile. I had two daughters, she a daughter and son when entering relationship. My eldest hates her now. She became pregnant, I suspect she stopped taking the pill, and we had a baby. She told me I had to marry her or she was leaving. I married her. She fell pregnant again. We had another baby. So, now a total of 6 children. Her two older children spend a weekend a fortnight at their fathers. I feel like it has to end but every time I peacefully try to talk about it she cries and says she wants us to work. I'm not in love. I don't find her attractive physically or mentally. She isn't my type. We never have any intellectual conversation or share any interests. She is lazy and doesn't clean up around the house unless asked to and she makes really dumb decisions. I have no control over my finances( we have a shared account) I have no family or friends left to help (she would always cry when I got invited to anything that was for some me time) my older children hate me and I have two little children to her that I love and don't want to hurt either. All I keep thinking is the only way I'm getting out is dead. I remember having times of desperation in my life before like this and I always made it through. But this feels different. I'm not crying. I'm ok, but I'm not ok. \n\nI'm sitting in my house alone right now. My wife is gone to her mother with our two children, my stepchildren at their fathers and my daughters withdrawing to their rooms on the social media not interacting with anyone. My thoughts are all one. Drive away. End it all. Do it now. It's all over anyway. They all hate you and want you gone. Die. Today is the day. \n\nBut I won't do anything. I'll sit and hold it all in and continue to be the sad clown. The dad who always turns up even though I'm not wanted. The husband who always provides even though he has nothing. The man who gives just to be forgotten.\n\nWhat can I do for me? Who can I become? My mind has been clouded from any effort towards physical creations. I can sit and think but I can not do. \n\nIt's all a simulation now.",

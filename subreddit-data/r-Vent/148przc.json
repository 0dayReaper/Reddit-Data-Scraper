    "postText": "I really hate how unhappy I am in life, even though my life on paper seems really great.  \nI've got a girlfriend who is the love of my life and we have been dating for over 4.5 years, we are planning to finally move in together in September.\n\nI've got a great job, I earn quite a decent salary for a 20 year old, could even possibly get a promotion soon-ish.\n\nI've got an alright family, parents are divorced, and sister is currently teaching English in Japan, l but nothing really that bad both my parents love me.\n\nI've got great friends, I often go out with them every weekend to the pub and have a decent time.\n\nI have had this drive in me to be more successful, be a better person, do more, make more, etc. I think that is what has led me to a 'successful' life - especially in regards to work. I think this is also the issue, I just can't be happy, It is like wired into my brain, I can't enjoy time off because I'm not studying or working.\n\nI can't enjoy relaxing, because I'm not trying to succeeded more in life. If i'm watching YouTube or trying to enjoy free time I am always thinking that I'm wasting my time, that I could be studying for my next certification or doing something to boost my career.\n\nThe moment I got my current job my first thought was how quickly could I get promoted? How could be as successful as possible? I hate this mentality I have.\n\nIt's like this horrible motivation I have. I wish I could be happy with the role I'm in, and once I finish for the day I would just enjoy watching movies or doing something actually fun. I do this sometimes, but when I do I just feel like shit because it was not productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have suffered with depression since I was a child, been on meds, therapy, etc, nothing worked. I think my brain thinks that the only way to get over depression is to be more successful, not no matter how many exams I pass or how far I advance in my career, I feel the same. I'd rather be working at some shitty job and be happy than where I am.\n\nHoping this all makes sense.",

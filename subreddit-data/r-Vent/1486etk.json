    "postText": "There's a REASON I don't come to you with my problems. There's a reason I never tell you things. Because when I did do that, your reaction showed me that you were not a safe person to talk to. When I was going through one of worst mental health crises of my life, you gave me no support that night, instead you told me I was lying for attention, or as an excuse for doing poorly in school (maybe because I had DEPRESSION). You said some other nasty shit I don't even wanna type.\n\nI literally had to work through all the things you said to me in THERAPY. Of course, I forgave you, and I'm still nice to you, because it's not like I can confront you about it, I don't know if I can handle another fight like the one we had. But it's been weighing on me recently, so maybe I can post on here to get it out of my system.\n\nY'all dont have to read or reply, but some support would be nice if you felt like it.",

            "comment": "I totally understand this. If i go to my mom when im really struggling she just yells at me and reminds me everything is my fault and what a screwup i am. Why I can\u2019t wake up early like most people or go to bed at a decent time. If i eat too much or too little. Like im unaware of my problems. It\u2019s because i suffer from chronic pain for 21 yrs. Since i was 15. Having multiple illnesses and getting hit by a car mean nothing. My dad doesn\u2019t even recognize my pain. Ive been on disability for years yet i just get crap how i need to work a full time job. \nThis is why i moved out at 16. Graduated early and left. I asked my stepmom and dad if i could come stay with them for a few months in their basement til i got my health and head on track. Their answer was no. My dad said no. Even though her daughter and her two kids lived there for years. \nParents can be really frustrating im sorry you have to deal with that. Not having emotional support from the ones that are supposed to be the most supportive is awful. Even at age 36. Its defeating",

    "postText": "This is hard to simplify, but basically, my family never calls me, visits me, or reaches out to me except to seemingly check in on me every 3 or more months. \n\nMy father died a few years ago, and since then I have felt very alone. My mother has many of her own struggles and as such is not able or willing to provide much support to me. So ever since my dad died it's like I'm all on my own. Sure I have friends, and I have my brother and cousins who I talk to. But there's only so much they can do.\n\nBut what about family? I don't feel close to many of them at all. Why is it everytime I visit their houses, my aunts and uncles, they always make me feel guilty by saying things like \"why don't you come over more\" and just generally frames it as ME who's the one not reaching out.\n\nLet me help you understand. I've been an adult for 7 years, I've had my own place for most of that time. Not once has any of my older family, not including my cousins, ever visited any of the places I've lived. They have never once visited me at my job where I've worked for 4 years. They never invite me to do things. They never call and ask how my day is going or what I've been up to. I don't know nearly anything about the people I'm supposed to call family, because even when we do meet, they don't seem to want to know more than basic small talk bullshit.\n\nYou might ask \"Well why don't you call/visit them?\" I have, countless times. It's the same thing everytime. I see them at a family event, they guilt me into feeling like I'm the one who is neglectful, and I make plans to visit them at their house. Then I go, we have a boring time talking about nothing, and then they say the classic \"Well come over whenever you want\". Which is another way of saying \"we don't give a shit enough to make plans, come if you want, otherwise we'll call you in a few months\". They don't start calling me more or anything, it's just that cycle repeated. Even if I do make an effort to see them more for a few weeks or whatever. \n\nThis is all before I mention that I've been struggling with mental health issues for years, which they are aware of. And in December I spent a month in the hospital and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. I lost a ton of weight, and could barely walk until February. I've been struggling with Crohn's since then. And then was in the hospital again last month for a fistula/abscess on my abdomen the size of a quarter, again restricting my ability to move. And before that I was living with my mom after the hospital, which was a narcissistic alcohol fueled hell hole of a house. \n\nSo I've been dealing with an incredible amount of stress, pain, and struggle in my life over the last 6 months. WHERE HAS THAT \"FAMILY\" BEEN!?? Nowhere to be seen. What, am I expected to call each family member and cry to them about my struggles and ask for support? They know what I'm going through, they just don't give enough of a shit to even call me. I could have really used their support recently, but I don't know how to ask for it. And at this point I'm so angry at them I don't know how to move forward without screaming at them all.\n\nI have big problems with anxiety and communication, it's very hard for me to just reach out and ask for support, it's like how can I call and cry to them about my struggles when we haven't spoken in months, and they barely understand me anyway. So I don't know what to do besides lay out my resentment to them and see what happens. \n\nWhat do you think, what would you do?",

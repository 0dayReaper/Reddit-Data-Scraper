    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure what to expect. I just need to talk I guess. For starters I\u2019m 22 and living with my parents. Since Covid hit my life changed. \n\nIn 2019-2020 I was renting a room with my partner (of two years). Long story short we end up splitting up , my job permanently shut down and I had to move back \u201chome\u201d. But things feel so different now. I went from being independent, working , a relationship to constant solitude. And I don\u2019t think I ever adjusted to that or the loneliness. \n\nI\u2019m currently looking for a job but it\u2019s hard to find something ( extremely ). So I\u2019ve been doing ubereats and I\u2019m also an author so I get monthly income from book sales. It\u2019s just enough to help around the house though not for me to enjoy life. It suck\u2019s watching my friends travel or always going out to eat when I\u2019m eating ramen for dinner like a loser. I can\u2019t remember the last time I ate something I actually wanted. And I know if I died today I wouldn\u2019t be happy with my life.\n\nI guess the point is I\u2019m lonely, broke and I have so much things I want to do. I worked since a child to get what I want and I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m ready to make good memories. I\u2019m tired of wearing the same clothes or not being able to stuff because I can\u2019t afford. I published a book and still nothing. I just feel like an unaccomplished loser in no matter what I do. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do anymore I feel so depressed and that I\u2019m wasting my years confined in a room suffering. I\u2019m 22 and it\u2019s been a long time like this. I just remember don\u2019t know what to do. Even watching old tv shows don\u2019t comfort me anymore",

    "postText": "\nAberystwyth's great storm of 1938,\nFrom 14th to 19th January 1938, a major storm caused extensive damage in Aberystwyth, with the promenade and pier being largely destroyed by 90 mph winds.\n\nThe promenade collapsed and was washed away in minutes.  Wave after wave entered houses flooding the basements to a depth of several feet and smashing all furniture before them.  Front doors were smashed to matchwood as boulders and paving slabs were hurled against them and large stones were driven against windows up to second-floor level, breaking the glass and letting in gallons of water.\n\nAt nearby Tanybwlch beach, three women decided to abandon their cottage and seek refuge with their neighbours when the front door was burst open by an enormous wave.  The next wave brought the roof down, pinning two of the women firmly under the heavy roof beams, with the third being knocked clean out of the cottage, only feet from the swollen River Ystwyth.  Their plight was noted by the driver of a passing train, who raised the alarm, allowing the emergency services to free the women from the wreckage..\n\nWork rapidly commenced on a protective coffer dam and the rebuilt promenade was well protected by an apron of boulders.  It was thought that the expensive lesson of 1938 had been well and truly learnt and that a repetition of the events of seventy years ago was a near impossibility.  However, the recent storms in January 2014 have shown that there is no room for complacency when dealing with such forces of nature.",

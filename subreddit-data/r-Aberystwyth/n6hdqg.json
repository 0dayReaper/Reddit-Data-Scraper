Networks and an easier foot in the door when I graduated. \n\nAs for % of success, it's really down to you and how many placements you apply for. From memory I applied for 18 + got two offers.",

Was actually just one guy looking for cheap employee to make sites for him, but tbf he was a very wise mentor. Bit of a prick though\n\nBecame a bit disillusioned/depressed, dropped out of uni at my third year. Thought I would take a break and start my third year in September, instead I thought I'd try and get myself on the career ladder instead. Turns out that placement was a jewel on my CV, got my first job working at a web agency in Cardiff (doing the same thing I was expertly trained to do at my placement.) Worked my way up, learned new technologies, re-learned the textbook stuff I learned at uni\n\nNowadays I'm tech-lead for one of the biggest startups in the entire country, earning a very generous wage. I'm thinking doing a conversion Masters degree at university, once lockdown is over. Student Loan will be paid off in 3-4 years, and I just put down a deposit for a mortgage on a big family home. Life's good.\n\ntl;dr placement good, don't skip it",

            "comment": "I did my CS degree back in 2011 so it might've changed, but very generally speaking around 80% of the year group get a placement in industry. As for whether it was worth it or not, 100%. I would suggest ALL students do it.\n\nThose who don't either chose not to do a sandwich year, or weren't successful finding a place. I'm not sure what that percentage is but I suspect it's about 50/50.\n\nThe university does have a good set of contacts in the industry, so it's unlikely not to find a place unless you really do horrifically bomb all of your interviews. The first and second year of your degree have some soft-skills modules related to CV building, interpersonal skills and interviewing, so by the time you're interviewing at an industrial year job you should be well prepared.",

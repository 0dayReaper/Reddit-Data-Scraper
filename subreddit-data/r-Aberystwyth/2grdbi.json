    "postText": "Just wondering about everyone's opinion on this... Seem to be a lot of hard-line 'buy local' sentiments flying around. But shouldn't we be glad that the rest of the world is investing in Aber?\n\nTake a look around, there's very little in a 20 mile radius that isn't poverty and sheep farming. (seriously, spend a day in Machynlleth...) I for one reckon its a good thing that Aber is bucking the trend.\n\nBut won't local businesses be affected? Yeah, they probably will. But that's a problem that businesses across the rest of the country have faced, what makes here so special?\n\nAs you might have guessed, I'm playing a bit of devils advocate here. Whats everyone's opinions?",

            "comment": "I think we already have enough coffee shops that Starbucks does seem a bit much. They aren't really going to bring anything new that the 'local' coffee shops can't offer and I will continue to use the local coffee/tea shops in favour of Starbucks and Costa.\n\nTesco on the other hand is a little different, they offer a variety of food that 'local' shops don't really even try to compete with. Due the location I'm guessing its going to be Tesco Express, which aren't really all that cheap anyway, so I doubt things like meat and veg are going to be that competitively priced with the proper local stuff, which is generally a higher quality depending where you go. The new Tesco is literally around the corner from my flat though, so I may have some bias due to the  convenience it will be to me.",

Which I would then fill with their overpriced victuals. After like ten years of pissing me off with that, and it changed overnight. Maybe once they actually start losing customers to the new store their sodding prices might go down a bit too.",

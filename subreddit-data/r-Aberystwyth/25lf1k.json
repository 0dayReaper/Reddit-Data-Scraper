    "postText": "So my wife and I are considering moving to Aberystwyth.  We're currently living in Berlin but getting bored of it.  Can anyone provide advice on finding a flat?  Cheaper is better, of course, but furnished is even better than that.  We're looking to stay at least three months, maybe more.  If anyone could point us in the right direction, that would be very helpful.\n\nAnd, of course, if anyone actually knows a decent place for rent (for around 400 or less per month), let me know!",

From what I can tell so far, outside of the town is cheaper but also absolutely beautiful. So if you drive a car should be perfect.. Also, many real estate around to ask for help. ",

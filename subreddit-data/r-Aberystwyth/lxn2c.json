An Entanet reseller is probably your best bet if you have moderate to high usage, for example [UKFSN](http://ukfsn.org).\n\nOtherwise if you wait a little while TalkTalk are apparently planning on unbundling the Aberystwyth exchange some time in November. No guarantee this won't be delayed at the last minute though.",

    "postText": "So, I am (maybe) looking to study art abroad, and stumbled across the university at Aberystwyth. Honestly the courses there looked pretty neat, and I am just wondering, how is the town? I feel like the town is very small(seeing the population), but every town has it's own feel to it so I wouldn't know unless I lived there!\n\n\nSo, basically I just wanna hear you guys' opinion on the city and the people in it. I kinda always pictured myself in a huge city, but maybe a small, cozy one is good as well.\n\n\n(I'm sorry if this is just messy rambling, I'm just really stressed out and need someones kind words, hah)\n\nEdit: \"Funnily\" enough the captcha word was \"Eigxam\", thanks reddit, for reminding me of the exam I have in like three days which I'm not prepared for :(",

            "comment": "I went to Aberystwyth having been born and raised in a big city. There are some really amazing things about Aber but there are a few things you need to learn to live with. \n\nThe town is small, it's isolated and it's pretty centred around the university. There's a feeling akin to a lack of privacy, because you constantly run into everyone you know. You will not discover new and interesting shops after the first month and there is a certain amount of monotony because you rarely see new things. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't let that put you off. Aber is a nice, safe place to be educated. Having people you know around you makes you feel part of a community and it means you're never far from help if you need it. It lets you focus on your education, undistracted by the various issues of city life. It lets you learn in a safe place, in a safe way, and it will not overwhelm you as a place. \n\nAber is far from perfect, and the uni has some very serious issues to tackle over the next few years, but as an Aberystwyth art grad, I fully endorse doing a degree there. \n\nIf you do decide to go, just PM me if you want any tips on how to avoid making the same mistakes I did. ;)",

            "comment": "Hey currently at Aber, It's not too bad it can be the same old same old, but if you like walking and exploring this town is great. We also have some amazing society's like caving, mountaineering, snowboarding/skiing, canoeing and kayaking as well as tons more. So that stuff really keep the town different. Depending on your drinking preference the town can be great, there are only two clubs and one which is possibly shutting down. They are both a bit of spit and sawdust but we also have lots of amazing pubs which means if you like a nice social pint you will be fine and if you prefer a more  student feel we also have got that covered. Recently the uni has been going down in it's reputation but certain departments still have very good standing and i'm sure the art department is one of them. It's a 3 hour train journey to Birmingham. So if you do want to go shopping and stuff it can make a nice change and day trip (I've even got one of the last trains out and drunk all night in Birmingham and got the first train home) The main thing to remember is aber is an amazingly beautiful town and it's a great student feel with the good sense of community. If you want any help looking at accommodation do message me I'm currently in Brynderw which is next to the school of art which is not on campus but rather in town. If you were going to stay in halls I would suggest looking at town residences. You will find that Bynderw has lots of horror story's online but if you have any questions I would be more than happy to send you pictures and give you more detail as it's really not that bad",

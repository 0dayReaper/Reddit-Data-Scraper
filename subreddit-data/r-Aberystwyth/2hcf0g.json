Is it typical that I would be unable to text or receive texts from numbers that originated outside the UK? \nThe numbers i am trying to text are currently here in the UK however.\nNot sure how to fix this, but kind of upset the phone i bought is not allowing me to do half of what i bought it for.

Be careful with text charges though if they're foreign numbers",

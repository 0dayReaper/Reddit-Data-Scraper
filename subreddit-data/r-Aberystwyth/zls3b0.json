However, perhaps they can be helped by image stabilisation in post. All is not lost. You have a good eye for framing and subject. Keep it up",

I was trying to go for a look that more resembles what one sees rather than the more objective view a tripod offers. Though it definitely works better for some compositions. \n\nIt's a good suggestion about stabilisation in post though and something I hadn't considered for some reason. I shall try again with that again with that in mind. Thank you for the feedback.",

    "postText": "Hey Aberystwyth!\n\nThis is an unusual request, but I\u2019m working on a project that every single one of you can help with (if you want). Info below, and also on my [website](https://www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain).\n\n# What\u2019s the project?\n\nI\u2019m putting together **a collection of photographs taken by the people of UK and Ireland during lockdown.**\n\nThese will be printed into a small photo book, as a memory of this strange few months and the many different ways in which lockdown has affected us. Each image will also have a short caption from the contributor, explaining why the image relates to their lockdown experience. The book will be printed later this year, with all profits going to a UK-based mental health charity (specific organisation TBC).\n\n# Who can contribute?\n\nLiterally anyone in or from anywhere in the UK/Ireland. You do not need to be into photography, you do not need to have a beautiful image to share or an amazing story to tell. The point is to get submissions from all walks of life. If you have experienced lockdown in the UK/Ireland in some way or another, I would love you to be part of this.\n\n# What do I need?\n\n1. **A photo.** As long as it relates to your experience of lockdown, anything goes. It could be something that brings you joy, or it might be something painful. Your highest high or your lowest low, or somewhere in between. It can be beautifully shot, or just a shitty blurry snap from your phone (this project isn\u2019t about photography skills). It might capture a big cultural moment, or something small and personal, even just something totally mundane. People, objects, places, selfies, pets... anything goes. **It just needs to be related to lockdown, and mean something to you.**\n2. **A few words.** To give the image some context, I just need you to let me know what the image is of, and what it means to you. These words will appear next to the image in the book, as a caption. Again, this isn\u2019t an exercise in creative writing, just write whatever comes to mind, and as much or as little as you like. Seriously, three words is fine, three hundred is fine also.\n\nSo that\u2019s my ask! Told you it was odd. To submit, or to find out more, I\u2019ve set up a page at [www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain](http://www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions on here and I\u2019ll definitely get back to you. And please do share this around if you want to - getting the word out is my biggest challenge at the moment!\n\nThanks so much.",

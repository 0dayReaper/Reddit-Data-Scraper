I don't think the University want to do this, neither could they even if they wanted to (and why the hell would they want to eh?). If the union want to ratchet up the heat with this kind of language then they should put their evidence out there. This argument is all built on rumour and hearsay and not much else, which makes for a pretty shitty argument.\n\nWhat it plainly is, is a PR disaster for Aberystwyth and Aberystwyth University, and that makes me pretty sad.

Myself and my old man had a walk up and down Consti and along the seafront on my last day in Aber today and I noticed the scafolding had come down. I had a glimer of hope that the inside was being re-done just like the outside has been...\n\nComplete false hope. The inside is still a wreck, stripped to the floorboards with paint/plaster falling off the walls etc. I've been told by the ex-major tonight that Brains (who STILL own the building and refuse to sell it) were threatened with a fine if they didn't carry out works to make it look more appealing as part of the Aberystwyth regeneration fund project. If they didn't redecorate, the council would and would forward the bill to Brains.\n\nBasically...not happening for a while, but I have heard other rumours tonight of something else happening that could be quite promising, but a bit ambitious...Not sure how much I can say",

Only idle speculation.\n\nOh well a shame, I do miss that place and there are very few places like that around the country. Why arent there more places that open late and have a separate dancefloor and bar area and are a bit of a lovable cheap dive? Hell even the first two would be good enough. So fed up of overly loud places with no where to go talk or to dance.\n\nWhen I first heard I thought I was expecting them to start converting it into flats or something. I still don't actually get what Brains are doing by just leaving it empty. It seems such a waste to leave it empty.",

Both of which were mulled over for what seemed like an eternity with brains then u-turning and pulling out. \n\nTBH it`d be a shame if it became anything other than the shit and sawdust bay we all know and loved.\n",

            "comment": "I haven't lived in Aber for over a decade so it may changed since but I wouldn't say that it is true to the point that it's became a problem. It's a place where a lot of people you see in town are students, so naturally there will often be pot smokers if that's what you mean by high. I think the harder drug users tend to live in Swansea.\n\nAberystwyth is also the place that people from surrounding villages go to if they become homeless (which is how I ended up living there as a teenager) the shelters used are Bed and Breakfast type places that are rented out by the council, there's one by the harbour and at least one near Constitution Hill. The people who run the place near the harbour also have houses around the town that they put homeless people in. Most of the homeless people I met had a lot of mental health problems which is par for the course but I don't think they would have made a huge impact on the area. Of course there are one or two characters that hang around and ask for money.\n\nI wouldn't describe Aberystwyth as rough, but I do think it had a slight problem at night with a lot of people drinking and getting a bit loud in the town centre. IIRC It wasn't so much the students getting drunk but people from the surrounding villages in their 20s-40s going out and getting completely rat arsed for a night out. \n\nSo that's three factors; Students smoking pot, more homeless people than usual, and villagers drinking too much. Yet, unless it's changed quite a bit in 10 years I wouldn't say it's a bad place to live and despite that I was a homeless teenager at the time of living there, I always remember Aberystwyth fondly.

Beautiful scenery, very chilled out atmosphere and a fantastic place for sailing/kayaking. The high people thing probably comes from the high concentration of students, worst thing you're likely to come across is a bit of weed. The town itself used to be a major Victorian seaside resort so it has a bit of a cheesy Victoriana thing going on but it's quite endearing. Some of the pubs are amazing and the crime rate is stupidly low, there's nowhere quite like it in the UK.",

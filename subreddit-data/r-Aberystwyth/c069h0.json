    "postText": "Hi\n\nWe will be staying in Aberaeron for a holiday with my family (parents, siblings, neices and nephews) for a week in July. I'm posting here hoping that, as Aberystwyth is close that you guys will be able to give us some good ideas for day trips. We have cars and the kids range between 2 and 5 years. The usual tourist stuff would be good such as cool towns, historical sites, beaches etc.\n\nThanks",

I\u2019ve tried reaching out to personal tutors to no reply &amp; my lecturers honestly seem too daunting to speak to after the condescending feedback they leave me \ud83d\ude05\n\nWhat I used at a levels (which I was getting A/B\u2019s) is giving me fails, and the feedback I\u2019m getting isn\u2019t helpful at all\u2026 I just got my worse essay to date and most of the feedback was just saying how I just misunderstood the question instead of saying how I *should* have done it\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n\nEdit: I have spent hundreds on textbooks &amp; put hours into my essays- they aren\u2019t done lazily or last minute, I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to structure my essays. Everything I learnt at a level I was quickly told was wrong &amp; I just don\u2019t know how to *write* well",

Your most recent essay, if you miss understood what the essay was supposed to be about, and now understand what the question is asking you to do. Whats stopping you from asking if you can at least discuss / submit a short form essay/plan of how youd approach it now with your new corrected understanding of the task to your lecturer to see if it would be on the right lines.",

If you know any of your coursemates you could even ask to have a look at their essays to see what kind of feedback they're getting.\n\nAll you need this year is 40% and it doesn't affect your final grade so don't sweat it too much.",

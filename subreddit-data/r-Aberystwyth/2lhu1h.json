            "comment": "It went down in the polls due to some professors leaving and the department needing more funds from the university proper. The staff and studet committee seem genuinely concerned about this and when I was there they were trying hard to fix the problems, even before the league table results were released. I therefore imagine the drop in position won't last too long.\n\nThere are still some quality lecturers present, like Dr. Ian Clark and Dr. Andrew Davis. \n\nAs \"I_miss_Chris_Hughton\" said, there is a lot of theory. And this really is a course which you get out of it what you put in. I worked hard for all three years and really saw my horizons expand, but some of my fellow alumini enjoyed the Aber' nightlife too much and (my own opinion, sorry) would probably have been off not wasting three years. Do the reading, prepare for seminars, do extra reading, prepare essays well in advance. Allow two drinking nights a week.\n\nThe key piece of advice I could give you, is to choose Interpol, but try and do a joint honours with Economics or Business. I wish I had thought of that, now I'm considering going to back to school and ding a seperate degree in Econ, which will waste three years of employment. \n\nI think Aberystwyth is a good choice. You will enjoy it, and living in a Welsh bubble will have the side effect of making you feel islated from the outside world, great when you are thinking about the theory of international politics. I imagine in London you wuld be discussing theory but it would feel more hands on, and you would bring personal opinions and judgements into your essays too much. The isolation of Aberystwyth has its benefits!\n\nGood luck",

I am predicted three A's, and it is between Exeter and Aber for me right now as my first choice so to speak.",

That said Aber has fallen down the league tables a fair bit recently and at least one department has been accused of grade inflation. I would be a weary of coming here if I wasn't already 2 years in, in case Aber doesn't stop dropping. ",

I understand that it has dipped in the rankings since I graduated; I'm not sure where Exeter stands in the league rankings. The teaching in Aberystwyth is pretty good, for Interpol at least. What exact course are you looking at studying? I think you also have to factor in what sort of environment you are looking for. Aberystwyth is a pretty small place, with around 16k people or so, although it's important to say that it's never quiet in Aber :) ",

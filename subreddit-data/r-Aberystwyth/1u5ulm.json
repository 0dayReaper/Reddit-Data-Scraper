    "postText": "Is anyone looking for a housemate next year? Everyone I know has already sorted their accommodation, and I stupidly applied for halls far too late so now I'm about 90th in queue. I'm not particularly fussy about room size. I would like to be paying about the same as I am in halls. Bills included is advantageous but it's not a disaster if that's not possible. I would like an internet connection that I can torrent with because it's driving me crazy not being able to do it at the moment. :P Pretty panicked to be honest! Really could do with not ending up starting next academic year homeless. I'm communally minded, friendly and sociable enough but quite like my quiet at times. I'm not a ball-breaker about everywhere being perpetually sparkling clean but I have the guts to ask people to clean up if they need to and welcome people making sure I pull my weight too. I'm 22 and have experience living independently before coming to uni, so hopefully I wouldn't be too offensive to third years/masters students who are probably younger than me. :P I study scenography &amp; theatre design and film &amp; tv, am a gamer and film nerd, non-smoker, etc etc blah blah blah. Let me know if I sound like what you're looking for. :)",

It is also very common for someone to leave unexpectedly in the first few months, so if you don't have anything lined up right away, just get a deal at a B&amp;B a week at a time and keep looking. \n\nPut some flyers up in the common areas of different uni buildings. You never know if someone will pick it up. Worst case, find a place in Borth and commute in on the train. (I am assuming you don't have a car, otherwise you should have no problem finding a place.)\n\nGo to the local estate agencies and tell them that you are a single person who isn't picky about rooms, and they might think of you if they have a group that is one person short. \n\nAlso, the guy who owns the fishing tackle shop and railway cafe opposite KFC on the corner has three flats in the building which he rents out but doesn't advertise. He's an arse, and never agree to work for him, but the rooms are nice even if he does wander around in his pants.\n\n",

Just keep your ear to the ground - it may be the case that you won't be sharing with undergrads (or even students at all, for that matter).",

A massive amount of rooms open up on pretty much the first day of term from people that didn't make it to the next year.\n\nThankfully, Aber is the place where you can walk round pretty much all the estate agents in a single morning. Though I recommend Uni notice boards and websites first. \n\nPersonal opinion, but avoid Alexanders. They were nothing but arseholes to me.",

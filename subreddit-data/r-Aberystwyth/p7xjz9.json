    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am a student of the IB Diploma. I am writing an academic research paper for the Extended Essay in Economics, where I am attempting to analyze the impact of the recently imposed National Living Wage on employees in the UK. \n\nThe survey set requires people working in the UK. Ideally, it would be nice to get responses from minimum wage workers aged 25 and above, however, any/ all responses will be extremely helpful.\n\nI request workers in the UK to please help me by participating in this survey and answer some very simple questions in the link attached.\n\nAlso,I will be extremely grateful if you can help circulate this survey to your known acquaintances in the UK. \n\nKeeping in mind the privacy aspect, please note that this survey is and will remain completely anonymous, nor will the data be reproduced anywhere. This survey, once again is for my course research purposes only and not for any other intention or purpose. \n\nThis is the link to my survey:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9SPhv00MxdtFl03pjvxj9QwLJ8PunPyZtvCKziFqKXlftJw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9SPhv00MxdtFl03pjvxj9QwLJ8PunPyZtvCKziFqKXlftJw/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

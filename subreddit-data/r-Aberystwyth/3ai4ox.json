    "postText": "I'm a Norwegian student studying in Wales, and for my bachelor dissertation I'm trying to find out if there are any differences in the hunting habits of cats at different longitudes. In other words I'm trying to find out if cats in the north kill more small animals than cats in the south! The main focus will be the difference between Norway and Wales (but anyone can participate if they want to)! I've made a questionnaire that you can fill out if your cat brings home any type of gift/prey for you, and you can fill it out as many times as you want to! Thanks!\n\n**TLDR: Let me know if your cat kills anything**\n\nHere's the questionnaire:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DYOKztwzeMOFJ6ahs4tMp23LXrkjVL7RdI9phwAYgX0/viewform",

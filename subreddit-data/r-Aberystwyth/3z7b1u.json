There's a list of their costs on the aber website if you want a look. You need a 100 pound deposit immediately and then the costs are around 1200 quid-ish every September, January and April. You could also look into private housing as well depending on how old you are. What i would say is that finding a job is fairly difficult, there aren't that many going and the one's that are tend to go fast, so it's something to bear in mind. Fortunately though the living costs are fairly cheap, i can get by on about 170 quid a month if im careful, including petrol (which you don't really need) and going out a couple of times. Hopefully thats some help. Btw are you 18 or a senior student?",

It depends on your parents income mind but for most people the loan covers the accommodation cost, and then you can see if you can get a maintenance grant as well. Honestly it's not too bad, if needs must you can save up for a year before coming here. I know a lot of my mates who did that. You might get a job mind, just there isn't a guarantee because it's only a small town. ",

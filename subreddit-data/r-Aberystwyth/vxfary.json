    "postText": "I was meant to be moving in to private accommodation in the centre of town in September but due to unfortunate circumstances I will not be staying in aber anymore. I am looking for someone to move into the house and take the agreement from me. It is a 6 bedroom house and there are currently 4 people who have rooms. It has 2 bathrooms and a shared kitchen with a washer and dryer in the property. It is around \u00a390 a week but will be confirmed with the agency. If you are interested please get in touch and we could schedule a viewing",

            "comment": "Most likely, the jets flying over Aber are from the 493rd fighter squadron 'The Grim Reapers', an American fighter wing based at RAF Lakenheath. This is based on the silhouettes I've seen, as they look a lot like F-15 Strike Eagles.\n\nAny other jets I've seen are from the UKs Fighter school, flying  Hawk T2's'(the same plane flown by the red arrows, but painted black) \n\nI've yet to see a Eurofighter Typhoon, or the new F35 II jets recently ordered from the USA",

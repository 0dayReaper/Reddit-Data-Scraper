I left my email address for them to pass on to the artist, in the hope that she'd come in and get the note and email me, but it's not a sure thing. I thought, if someone online would be able to put me in touch with the artist, it's someone here!\n\nThank you. :) Worst case scenario, you all get to see a picture that I think is quite nice!\n\n**Update 2nd August 2015:** Found!

    "postText": "This will apply to other people, but students will be mostly affected. As a town Publican, wanted to warn you about a change to government hospitality rules.\n\nAs landlords, we now require proof of address on entry to a pub. So, whilst you might ve used to showing your provisional as ID, this sill most likely has your home address on it, not current address.\n\nI would therefore advise you keep a digital copy of a utility bill or housing contract you can use as proof of address if youre plannong to go out in town for some drinks this week.\n\nMuch love, stay safe",

They have therefore advised hospitality management to check address IDs for customers.\n\nIt's just another example of COVID mitigation strategies being complicated really - I'm sure there's science to back it up somewhere.",

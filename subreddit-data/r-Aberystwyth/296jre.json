    "postText": "So, just a heads up. Source games like Team Fortress 2 use P2P when searching for servers via steam. \n\nThis will cause the internet to be cut off for about an hour as soon as you hit the search.  You can however enter the ip address of a TF2 server manually via the console command. \n\nAside from that you just need to make sure that the correct ports are open. I seem to remember being able to register the same MAC address twice on the system to allow for another 20 ports on the same machine, however, you can only have 5 devices at the same time.\n\nI graduated in 2013 so things may have been updated since then but I doubt much has happened too much in the last year or so.\n\nAdditional to this is the PS3 and Xbox 360.\nI made this work by setting up internet sharing via my laptops LAN cable + WiFi (because you need 2 netowork cards) and forwarding the ports. If you try to test the connection via the Playstation I always found that it failed but skipping the testing phase somehow made it work... It could be another P2P issue. The 360 should just work with port forwarding and internet sharing.\n\nSo yeah. Good luck guys. :D",

            "comment": "For a family I'd say avoid the town centre, Full of halfway houses so people roaming the streets drinking and on drugs, The locals and student drinking culture here seems to be make as much noise as possible after a night out so you hear regular screaming and shouting at 4am. Waunfawr is probably one of the nicer areas of Aberystwyth I'd suggest getting a house there for a family.",

But from my brief experience living there in certain areas there are issues with youths ( I caught 2 of them trying to break into my shed ) and drugs ( mainly around the park and football club ) which the police largely ignore and very noisy neighbours ( might of just been the area I lived ) I'd strongly suggest Waunfawr be your main option nice quiet living and an older population.",

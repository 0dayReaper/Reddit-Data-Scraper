    "postText": "hi folks, i just got accepted to aberystwyth uni for graduate study and i was wondering if anybody could tell me about their experience there? i know a majority of the replies will be undergrad, but honestly everything helps (i'm from the US and i've only been out of the country for studying abroad once). \n\nwhat's the student life like there? was it easier to live on campus or off campus? how was getting around the campus? \n\nif you have any other tips or things to share besides those questions, please do! i'd love to hear it. thanks fam :\\^)",

In the first year I lived in H13 and in the third I lived in K20. K20 was at the top, directly above the vent for the tumble dryers.\n\nOn Friday nights, when everyone was in a hurry to get their favourite clothes clean and dry for a night out I got to smell the sweet, sweet scent of fresh laundry wafting up from the vent!\n\nI feel this was karma for having to live in one of the \"Hafan\" caravans when I first started (I started twice as I got a pretty bad injury the first time I started). If you don't know what Hafan was, the Uni used to have some horrid old trailer-park style caravans behind the union. They were demolished in 2005-2006.",

ALP have a fair few towards that time (Or atleast they did for me). Just keep pestering estate agents and be prepared to travel to aber on short notice to look at it. I'm sure you will find something! \n\nFailing that a lot of freshers don't make it more than a few weeks in. So rooms will open up with the uni.",

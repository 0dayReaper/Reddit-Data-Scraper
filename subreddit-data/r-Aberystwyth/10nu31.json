    "postText": "On Monday October 8, at Waunfawr Community Hall, Aberystwyth, we'll be running a trial event for what could hopefully become a new regular tabletop gaming gathering/event for anyone.\n\nFor those that don't know much about board gaming - it's not your typical game of Monopoly at family holidays where everyone ends up hating each other - these games are a lot more interesting, strategic and fun. If you're at all in to video games, you'll probably have a good time. If you're not, there's still a lot to like.\n\nTake a look at [Wil Wheaton's Tabletop](http://tabletop.geekandsundry.com/) for a bit of an over-excited idea of what's out there.\n\nBring any games you want to play, but we'll be bringing a big pile of great board games to learn and play too, things like:\n\n * Dominion\n * Ticket to Ride\n * Carcassonne\n * Pandemic\n * and a load more, from super simple to deep and complex\n\nWe don't expect any level of experience or knowledge of the games - you can either sit with your own group and learn, or there'll be a few of us there to explain the rules.\n\nWe'd like to make this a fortnightly event if there's enough interest, with hopes to expand in to other forms of tabletop gaming like wargaming &amp; RPGs.\n\nIt would be great to have you all come along to show that there's enough interest to keep this event going, and to spread the word to any of your friends or family that are in to their board games.\n\n**Location**: [Waunfawr Community Hall, Aberystwyth, SY23 3PN](http://goo.gl/maps/Y4MDy) - just a few minutes walk from the University Penglais Campus   \n**Date**: Monday 8 October - 7-10pm - come any time between those hours.  \n**Entry**: Free\n\nOn Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/events/475095445844355/\n",

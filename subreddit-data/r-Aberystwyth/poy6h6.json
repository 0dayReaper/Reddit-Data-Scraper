I know this sounds dodgy but I just want to give him a present and he won't tell me the date.  We are in Canada so trying to find relatives that would help is difficult.  TIA",

You\u2019re on Reddit asking for tips on how to find out personal information on somebody, which they have explicitly refused to divulge to you themselves.\n\nMy advice: Regardless of your reasons, respect people\u2019s right to privacy.\n\nEdit: I see you\u2019ve downvoted my response. Perhaps you shouldn\u2019t ask daft questions then",

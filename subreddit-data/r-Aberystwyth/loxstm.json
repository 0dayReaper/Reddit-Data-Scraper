For some reason the university wants a login to access this bit \u2639\ufe0f\n\nAny student login should be helpful. \n\nPS: I'm wanting to study computer science so if any student studies that and is on Reddit comment below, I'm sure I've got a lot of questions for you.",

But at the same time, you aren't going to see anything new that you won't get from the module summaries and sometimes over half the modules are coursework anyway. You'd do better reading those module summaries, emailing/phoning members of the staff in the department and chatting to students who have already completed the course.",

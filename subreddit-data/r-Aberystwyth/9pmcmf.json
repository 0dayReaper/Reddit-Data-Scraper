Admittedly it wasn't the most thorough check, but I'm not about to risk not having my PC for the entire year, just for the sake a few hours and 80p. Seems like a daft risk to me.",

Plus, it's not like the checks are just for the sake of taking 80p off of you, they do actually make sure your stuff is safe to plug into the mains, which is nice to know at the very least.\n\nAnd also in my defense last year there were 2 guys and about 3 people ahead of us, so I had no idea it would be that bad this year. Whoever is in charge of managing these things need to be fired. The poor guy that was doing the tests wasn't given accommodation for the night, and so has to drive all the way home to Yorkshire tonight. I only got my shit done at fucking half past midnight.",

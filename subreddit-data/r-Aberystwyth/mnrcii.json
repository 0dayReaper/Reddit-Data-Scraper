    "postText": "Hi, two friends of mine are looking at getting private accommodation together (one room). One is a student at the university so something within walking/ bus distance to the campus would be ideal. Perhaps somewhere close to town with job opportunities? If anyone knows somewhere which might be suitable either them and easily affordable please send links my way! Thanks in advance :)",

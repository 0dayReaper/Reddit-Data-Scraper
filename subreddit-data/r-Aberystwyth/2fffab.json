    "postText": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI'm an international student who's living in the Rosser G residence this coming year. \n\nMy main question is how easily accessible are things like bedding, cutlery, adapters for electrical outlets in town? I have looked online, specifically at the site Click 2 Campus and there \"Essentials Pack\" which includes most of the items I will need. Anybody have success using this service? Or is it best to wait it out, and pick up everything I need when I arrive. I am mainly looking for convenience, but also would prefer not to spend a fortune. \n\nThanks",

When you don't have the time to go out and buy stuff , order it on Amazon and it will be there in less than 24 hours.\n\n\n As for the shops in town they're not bad, you've got Matalan, Argos, Morrisons and B&amp;M bargains as well as a few others so you do have a bit of choice if you decide to go down that route.",

I won't be arriving until probably around 5pm and it could be a rough night if I don't have any bedding/pillows and stuff. ",

For example Argos normally closes at 8PM, 6PM on Saturdays and 4PM on Sundays. I wouldn't be surprised if some places are actually open for longer during the weekend of the 20th-21st when everyone starts arriving. I have never seen town so busy throughout the year as it was during the weekend. EDIT: Forgot to mention the time examples were about Argos",

Heck, I remember trying to get a lamp in Argos in my moving in day years ago - was not a fun experience! Good looking luck! ",

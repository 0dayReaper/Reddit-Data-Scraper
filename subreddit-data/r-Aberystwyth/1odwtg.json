Music gets repetitive though, it's either themed or the UK top 20 over and over again as far as I can tell\n\nRe-load: so far it's been shit, except for fresher's week. apparently it was better in the past. Not many people actually go there.\n",

            "comment": "In my opinion Why Not is overpriced, overcrowded and only plays crap R&amp;B and pop, over and over again. It is the go to place for people who have never lived in a big city, and therefore have less experience with clubs. Also, I could never bear how hot it got in there, but I am Scottish, so I feel the heat more than others.\n\nPier Pressure is bigger, so it doesn't get as hot, but it has many of the same issues as why not. Sometimes I swear they just have someone's ipod playing on the sound system. It is more expensive than Why Not.\n\nRe-Load is ok depending on what kind of night you are going to. On a normal night it is just a bog standard night out. On a theme night, it can actually be really fun. I always loved headphone discos and drum and bass and dubstep nights. It is not as expensive as other places, but because you are on uni campus, you do have to be on better behaviour because there is a hell of a lot of security. \n\nI always preferred angel, because it has separate club and pub bits, but it also has problems with getting very hot and crowded.\n\nAll in all, there are no \"good\" clubs. Aber is a very small town with a lot of students, so whenever something good is on, you will have to fight to even move. ",

No toilet paper. Pulled up my jeans. Went to wash my hands, no soap. Walked back to Rosser halls with warm squishy arse hole and stinky hands. Still love Lidl, would still go back to the Angel. Played a gig there once, took TP and soap in my guitar case. ",

    "postText": "Hi! My flatmate and I are planning to move to Aberystwyth from London for the next uni year (they go to uni) so we wanted to know how the situation is around there (how much work demand there is, balance between wages and living cost, etc.).\n\nI was also wondering how good the internet providers get around there, I game a lot and they need it for work so I need to know that the connection is going to hold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso sorry if this has been asked before, but every article I find on google tells me something different, so I thought I'd check in with the locals :) Thanks!",

The coastal location certainly makes up for all the cons and everyone very friendly.\n\nI would say work demand is average. \nA fair bit of grocery and retail here but going down to be fair as people shop online. Council, Uni and hospital offering the bulk of professional service and admin jobs. Plenty of coffee shops and bars around and places to volunteer. Reply if looking for something specific.\n\nInternet.\n\nAberystwyth not short of gamers.\nIn town you\u2019re looking at FTTC with most places near 60-80 down. FTTP is populated in some town areas and on the rise. Some places and around the outside of town and Bow Street already offering FTTP. Openreach always very busy and improving.",

I got offered a programming job in aber for practically minimum wage I applied and got a job elsewhere with less duties in the IT realm for 4K more than aber offered. I would not recommend aber to anyone anymore it used to be a lovely town but it\u2019s going to be a ghost town within 2-3 years.",

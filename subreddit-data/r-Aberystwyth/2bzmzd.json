    "postText": "I've been looking at postgraduate studies in the UK (I'm from Canada and I have never even been to Europe). Aberystwyth University seems to have the best program for what I'm looking for. I have some concerns though. I will definitely need to get a job while there, and since it's a small town, I was wondering what the job opportunities were like. Also, what websites do you usually use for apartment hunting or finding roommates, and which areas of the town should I be looking at to be as close as possible to the university (I can't afford to stay in a dorm). Also, for anyone who has attended the university, what was your experience like? Any other things I should know, I would love to hear. ",

If you have any more specific questions feel free to message me :) ",

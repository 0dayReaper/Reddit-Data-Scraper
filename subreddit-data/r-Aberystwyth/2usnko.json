Rummers has vodka Tuesdays (as well as gin Thursdays which are awesome because they have live music) , and I'm almost certain that a lot of the other bars and pubs in town have discounts on Tuesdays because that is when a lot of students tend to go out and the whole economy of this town relies on student spending.

Also Vodka and Gin Tuesdays in Rummers.\n\nVarsity on a Tuesday is actually one of the most dire experiences in Aber specifically because every lad and partygirl knows about it. Good luck waiting half an hour to order a pint as the horde of girl-eyecandy-bartenders struggle to serve everyone having been seemingly picked for their good looks over efficiency. ",

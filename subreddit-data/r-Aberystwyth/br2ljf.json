    "postText": "I'm an American who's going to be starting postgraduate work at Aberystwyth in the fall. I'm an Episcopalian and love being part of a church in the US that accepts all LGBT+ people and allows for same-sex marriage. I want to get involved with a church in Wales, but only if they're accepting of all people. I'm trying to figure out if any of the churches in Aberystwyth are LGBT+ affirming. I've done a lot of googling but church websites haven't really been helpful. I would hate to get involved in a church only to find out that they're against same-sex marriage or reject queer people.\u00a0Can anyone help me with this?",

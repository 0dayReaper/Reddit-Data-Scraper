    "postText": "Was anyone else in the Aberystwyth/north Ceredigion area woken by a loud quick succession of 4 bumps, at 04:53 today (Sunday)? It shook the house a little, but it was the noise more than anything that woke me. It also startled the cats. This morning in the local church there was some plaster fallen down - which could of course just be a coincidence. No damage as far as I can see in the house. No report of seismic activity online. Planes breaking the sound barrier over the bay?",

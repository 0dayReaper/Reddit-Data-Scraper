            "comment": "I graduated 5+ years ago, so I imagine things have changed. But I'll throw in my 2 cents as this is a quiet sub. \n\nI don't remember many parties as such but I remember long lazy days barbecuing and drinking on the beach in summer. Walking in the yellow gorse hills or along the river with a few tinnies in spring. Cider on the train through a flooded and otherworldly mid Wales in autumn (if you were able to get out). Winter nights so reckless that cardigan bay was practically throwing the shingle beach at the promenade while you'd be sat snug in an old pub. Waiting for it to blow over.\n\nAberystwyth University is small, and I remember the halls being policed quite well for first years. Warnings for smoking, noise, having people stay over. And anxieties run high with first years so far from home, some were happy to make complaints for the smallest things. But the pubs were always packed and reasonably priced. Events run throughout the year. Societies are well attended and revolve around nights out. People make friends easy and there's plenty of exploring to do.\n\nIf you're asking is there a drinking culture in Aberystwyth, there undoubtedly is. And plenty of places to do it. ",

Beach parties with a hundred people showing up still happen, and clearly the halls are noisy on a saturday night. \n\nWhen I was there house parties were big and there's a couple of clubs, definitely had fun, it's small enough that you end up knowing everyone one way or another so always something to do.",

We have 2 clubs and a couple of late-night bars, and there's usually pre-drinks in somebody's place.\nI'd very much recommend visiting overnight before you decide if that's art all possible; we are a long way from anywhere, which can get a bit much if you're used to living in/near to a city.\nThat said, small town life is great if that's what you're into. You can pretty much guarantee you will run into someone you know on a night out after a few months, but you'll also likely run into that embarrassing one-night-stand too. ",

As others have commented, there are two nightclubs - both of which are quite small compared to say what Cardiff or Bristol might define as being a \"nightclub\", they are open til early in the morning and they have a dancefloor - so they fall under the description of \"nightclub\".\n\nAber does however, punch above its weight with pubs. At its height its said there was on average a pub for every 50 people who lived in Aber. A lot have closed down over the last 10 years, but there is still a big enough range that you could probably do 6 pints a night in a different pub for every pint for a week and never go to the same place twice.\nParty wise, in private accommodation, you do see and hear of parties, but they happen a lot less than other university towns (I used to live in Treforest, right next to University of South Wales for example) which is a quite small uni in the scale of things, and that was about 400% more party-like than Aber.\nIt's a lovely town, you will get to know everyone within weeks and you will enjoy it here!

If not, the best place in walking distance would be the Ystwyth where it runs behind Tan y Bwlch beach. \n\nYou can swim the entire length of the straightened section at slack water on a high tide, or if you just want to get in a river to have a little pootle about then walk to the end of where the river runs behind the beach and there\u2019s a deep enough area there to swim.",

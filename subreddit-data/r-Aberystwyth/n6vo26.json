I have found a few issued with traveling to the UK as I am from Tanzania and it is a red-listed country, is there any quarantine procedures before I reach the Uk? Does the university offer as a quarantine area? If there is a quarantine. Is it possible for me to gain entrance into the UK?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

I think you should do what the other person said and reach out to uni's support, I can confirm they're indeed lovely and will do the best they can to help you",

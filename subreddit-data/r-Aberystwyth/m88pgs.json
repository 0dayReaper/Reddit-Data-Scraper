    "postText": "Hello guys :) I'm want to go to either Aberystwyth or Leeds for exchange this autumn. Do you think corona will affect the social scene at Aber in a bad way? (societies, sports clubs, pubs++). Do you have any thoughts? Afraid ill end up being isolated and alone in a foreign country. I really hope you guys can help me out!",

            "comment": "In normal times the social scene here is pretty great, but it's been devastated this year to be honest. Everything hinges on how thing progress from now until the autumn. \n\nRight now we've been in lockdown so there basically hasn't been one; online events are largely dead and everything's shut. \n\nLast autumn pubs etc. weren't functioning as normal (I avoided them personally) and a lot of clubs and societies struggled to do anything, but outdoors-related ones managed to function alright. There were a number of beach events, as well as online events, which haven't been all that successful.\n\nIf things are better next year but not completely normal I'd expect the nightlife to be missing its clubs but with pubs open; perhaps lots of outside stuff on the beach too. It's hard to say but clubs and societies that don't involve direct contact may be able to run club/soc-related events as usual to some extent but probably with less pub crawls, and outdoors-related clubs and societies may run as usual. \n\nUnfortunately it's all up to the council and SU and government; we don't even know what we'll be able to do in three weeks nevermind next year. The situation will probably be similar either in Aber or Leeds though. What I will say is that covid case rates have been extremely low in Ceredigion relative to everywhere else for the entire pandemic - which is great - but this has had little impact on restrictions other than avoiding regional lockdowns.\n\nAberystwyth is in a great environment for getting outside though if that's your thing, lots of great places to explore, both locally around/outside town and further afield.",

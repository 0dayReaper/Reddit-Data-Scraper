    "postText": "Hi! So I\u2019m submitting my application tomorrow for Aberystwyth University and wanted to ask to those who went, who soon after you submitted your application did you get a response on acceptance? I know the acceptance rate is high, and I\u2019m very much so academically talented and am not at all worried about my qualifications, more so just wondering how long it took. Thanks in advance!",

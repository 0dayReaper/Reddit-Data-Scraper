            "comment": "If you want a shared house arrangement then probably the Student Village is your best bet if you don't already know people in the town. It's right beside the Penglais campus.\n\nIf you don't want random housemates then there are student halls with bedsit type rooms.  These are available on campus and (when I last was there) on the seafront and near the old college. There are even some catered halls which provide meals and laundry services.\n\nOther than that you would be looking at renting a private bedsit or flat in town but with bills included it is unlikely to be cheaper or as close to campus.\n\n\\*This is all assuming you are looking to rent a place on your own, not with friends etc.",

It is basically right near the campus, it is like a 5 minute walk to get to classes from there. To get to the town center you just walk down the hill (and get a free workout when you have to walk back up). You share a house with other students, I had 3 flatmates who were exchange students themselves and one who was a regular student. I really miss Aber.\n\nAs for cheaper options, I have no idea, I just went with the student accommodation and didn't look to rent a place myself.",

            "comment": "A few private houses down in town are cheaper than the uni accommodation and usually pretty nice areas (can usually find some that are close to old college or right in the town centre). Only thing is that a lot of students are looking for places in town to live atm for next year and for the summer so I don't know how the availability is rn. Could definitely be worth looking at some of the agency's online and see what kind of prices they have so you can see which one seems better for you. \n\nIn terms of uni accommodation though, cwrt Mawr is the cheapest and alright, you get a good sized bedroom with a sink in it, you share a kitchen and I think a bathroom as well? But not sure on that. Then it's Rosser which is a small bedroom but with an en suite and shared kitchen again. PJM is nice, can get a good sized room, shared bathrooms but there's 2 toilets and a bath and shower, and a fair sized kitchen. These three are pretty good for their money as well being what they are.",

            "comment": "I would strongly recommend going for campus accommodation. Most of your social life will probably be on campus, and you want to be close to that. I see Rosser and Cwrt Mawr (price band 1 is somewhat better, and well worth the increase of 10\u00a3 a week) as the most central ones, although you could make a case for Pentre Jane Morgan and Fferm as well. The latter two are more expensive, though.",

            "comment": "I have a lot of Erasmus friends and most of them live in Uni accommodation (all of the ones I know wither in PJM or Cwrt Mawr) and if it's in your budget I do recommend living on campus for exchange because it opens you up to easily making friends and living in town may be a bit isolating. There are also flatshares in town that you could rent a room in if you are looking to move in with people but don't know anyone yet.",

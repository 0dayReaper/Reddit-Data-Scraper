    "postText": "Hello Aberystwyth, we've made a college and university oriented  discord community for students around the world to share ideas, make  friends, promote themselves, and discuss college experiences in a  laid-back environment. We have interest channels including sports,  music, politics, technology, cars, anime, and so much more! We also have  a college advice channel, class scheduling channel, tutoring &amp;  homework help channel, as well as other college and university-related  channels! If you need people to play games, vent, chat, or study with,  consider hopping in to introduce yourself!\n\n[https://discord.gg/y6anv3f](https://discord.gg/y6anv3f)",

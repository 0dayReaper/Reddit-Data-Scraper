Anyone with experience being an exchange student there?\n\nAlso do you think corona will affect the experience in a bad way?\n\nI know its a very small place, so kind of afraid it'll be too little to do and experience\n\nAll help would be a lot appreciated! :)",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know anything about Leeds, but as a current student at Aberystwyth University I can give you my (maybe a little biased) review!\n\nThe ocean is BEAUTIFUL and there are always bonfires on South Beach. There\u2019s a million different places to get a great overlook of the town and the sea, and many a drunken adventure has been had on top of Constitution Hill at 2am. Even with most things being closed now, there\u2019s always things to do. Additionally, restrictions will very likely be much less strict by the time fall rolls around. There\u2019s plenty of pubs and caf\u00e9s in town, and even in lockdown it\u2019s nice to grab a coffee and sit on the benches or the beach.\n\nThe downsides- it can get WINDY. Like yanking your windows open in the middle of the night windy. It\u2019s not always gusty but when it is it can get pretty insane. \nCampus is also at the top of a gigantic hill. Everything is on a hill really. On the bright side, if you\u2019re trashed in town and don\u2019t feel like walking for 20min to get back to your accommodation, you can always grab a taxi for pretty cheap (especially if you\u2019re splitting the cost). Or if you live in town, it\u2019s not too bad to walk home. Your legs will hurt for the first few weeks of trekking the hill but it builds up muscle really quickly and gets much easier.\n\nEverything is in walking distance, which was an awesome change for me, coming from a very rural town in America where you had to drive 30min for the grocery store. And there\u2019s a train station right in the center of town that\u2019s really easy to access and use if you have the TrainLine app (plus there\u2019s a direct route to Birmingham International Airport if you\u2019re flying in, which is super helpful if you\u2019re a bit new to trains like I was).\n\nTL;DR \n\nPROS- great views, beautiful area, plenty of pubs and caf\u00e9s, great opportunities for bonfires\nCONS- can be windy as fuck, giant hill if you live on campus\n\n\nHope this helps, sorry I don\u2019t know anything about Leeds. Good luck!",

How\u00b4s social life, and is there a lot to do there? I know it\u00b4s kind of a small town and isolated far in the west coast of Wales, so Im kind of afraid that ill feel isolated there with not much to do - but I really dont know so thats why I'm asking you guys",

                            "comment": "So in the autumn it won't be warm. It's coastal so rarely snows or gets very cold. Probably quite wet and wild especially come November onwards. You just have to embrace that really. Aber is beautiful in the sunshine but has so much character in the rain too.\n\nIf you're hear for a semester don't plan to do too much else except be in Aberystwyth and maybe a few nearby towns. You can get to Shrewsbury in 1.5 hours for an interesting old English border town Birmingham in 3 hours for a modern city.\n\nBut Aber can often flood in the last quarter of a year so you can get stuck in the Aber bubble.\n\nExcellent pubs, great food, independent shops, books everywhere, beautiful coast, great people, very safe, relaxed friendly uni, arts centre, museum, national library/art gallery. Very welcoming and a slow pace. \n\nSpent 3 of the happiest years of my life in Aber and have gone back every year since. I still haven't run out of things to do.\n\nLeeds is a great city. On par with Manchester Liverpool or Birmingham. Yorkshire is a brilliant part of the country. Very friendly, pretty cheap, incredible beer and food. Leeds has everything you'd expect a UK city to have and is probably one of the best. Obviously this comes with the pitfalls of any big city. One of the best things about Leeds in my opinion is that you could get to York really easy which is probably my favourite city on the UK to explore and hang out. You could get to Whitby as well which is an incredible coastal town that gives Aber a run for its money (probably better from a visitors perspective). You can also get to Manchester and other great places so you could certainly see a lot of the North in a semester if you wanted to.\n\nWhatever you choose you can't really go wrong. Aberystwyth and Yorkshire are my favourite parts of the UK. Good luck.\n\nEdit: if you have any more questions hit me up. Also if you pick which town and want recs I can give you a list of best pubs, places to eat things to see.",

If you want a party town you can't beat leeds- aber has 2 clubs and they're both terrible if you're used to big city nightlife. If you want peace and quiet then come here. The people are friendlier here too",

Aber is neither big itself, nor close to any big cities (2.5 hours from Chester, Cardiff, Birmingham, etc ). Aber is in the middle of nowhere, and has few of the big city attractions. But that is a huge part of its charm, too. People (like me) go to Aber and never leave. I came here as an exchange student in the early 90s.  Still here, and I still love it. If you're looking for a big-city metropolitan university experience, Aber might not be for you. But if you're looking for a beautiful campus surrounded by the mountains and sea, and a University that really cares about the student experience, I can't imagine a better choice than Aber.",

The quality of entertainment available here is as good as bigger cities but cheaper and all within walking distance.  \nThere are also lots of awesome uni societies. Team sports (football, rugby, basketball, etc), water-sports (kayaking, surfing, swimming, etc), Outdoorsy societies (conservation volunteers, hiking, mountaineering, etc) or more indoors-y clubs (tabletop gaming, computer gaming, drama, debating) And many many more.  \n\n\nLeeds is just like many other cities, but theres nowhere else like Aber!",

            "comment": "So I spent my student years in Aberystwyth and then 3 years living in Leeds after graduating for work and have to say I absolutely loved both places for completely different reasons.\n\nAberystwyth was lovely coastal town with a ridiculous number of pubs to go to. Lots of coastal walks or walks into the hills.\nThe worst part of Aberystwyth would be transport links but the Welsh coast is up there with anywhere to explore.\n\nGetting involved with sports clubs and societies is a great way to meet people to do things with in either place. The exchange students in Aberystwyth were some of the nicest people to get to know as well and I've since been able to take a few trips to visit lifelong friends I've made worldwide through meeting them.\n\nAs for Leeds despite not being a student I knew a couple of friends doing their masters there so was invited to join them in a lot of their student nights which were a great night, much more clubbing than Aberystwyth though still a great range of pubs around too.\n\nFrom Leeds you can get trains to more or less anywhere from York to Scotland to Manchester to London (Leeds to London was around 2hrs 20) so plenty of day trips to take or you can stay local and walk the canal or head on plenty of nice walks up towards the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nFrom Leeds there were some coach day trips to take as well which were really popular with exchange students taking you all over the UK to places like Bath &amp; Stonehenge.\n\nSo it really depends what you're looking for though I found both to be great places to live and plan to regularly return to both post pandemic for visits. \n\nBest of luck with your exchange programme and let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know from me.",

In Aber you can walk everywhere, and you'll make friends very quickly and easily.  There's also a dange of just getting a generic UK city experience in Leeds - Aber is totally unique, you won't get that mix of internationalism and small town Wales anywhere else. There's more than enough to do something every night in a normal year.\n\nThe only thing that's difficult to comment on is what the Covid situation will be like.  If at all possible, I'd defer the exchange another year - I am expecting things to be pretty much back to normal again in the autumn, but just to be on the safe side. As of this week, one third of the population of Wales has had the first Covid shot and vaccinations are progressing rapidly, so hopefully we'll see a drop in deaths very soon - in fact, we've already had a couple of days with no deaths in Wales.",

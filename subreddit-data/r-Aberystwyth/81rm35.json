    "postText": "I have been a in Aberystwyth for 8 years. When first moving here I was happy to see a second hand and somewhat \"retro\" games store.\n\nHowever I am very much get up with the pathetic amount of testing they put their goods through. \n\nOver the last 6 years, myself and friends have purchased goods from there. A 6 year period and variety of consoles, games and contolers shows this is not an isolated incident. \n\nFirst purchase psp . Got home to find the screen had dead pixels and one game was unreliable. But I was 16 so I thought oh well. \n\nAfter the first I was weary however did go there as a last resort for retro games.\n\nSecond purchase god of war and crash 3 ps2.\nCrash skipps. \n\nStar wars battlefront 2 psp\nSound skipps, screeches and skips. \n\nDsi  good for a few weeks, stopped reading games.\n\nMy most recent and very, very final purchase a psp  street. Not only was the staff member who served me stincking of alcohol and inibriated, he was unable to use the card machine leaving me without a receipt.  (No recipes a common theme). \n\nBig surprise the charger cable dose not work, or maybe it is the battery.  Who knows when visiting game park Aberystwyth! ",

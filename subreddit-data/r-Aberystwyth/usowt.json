What are the quality of the Halls?\n\n4. Is there a laundrette in the building or near?\n\nAny help and other information would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much!",

            "comment": "1. You share a 150Mbps link to JANET, which means speeds are normally pretty good. Individual halls connections used to be limited to 10Mbps I'm not sure if that's still the case. Bittorrent and various other P2P programs triggers an automatic block on your connection for 30 minutes (as I understand it this is more about keeping the network quality reasonable for everyone than for stopping piracy), so if you're into that sort of thing you'd probably want to get an external seedbox.\n\n2. The road is barely used at night, the main noise you're likely to get is from other students in the hall.\n\n3. Haven't stayed in Alexandra myself but in general they're pretty nice (Penbryn was always a bit grotty, but I think much of that's been refurbished now).\n\n4. As far as I'm aware Alexandra has its own laundry.\n\nOut of curiosity, what're you planning on studying?",

You can't bypass the ports via proxy because you pass by the server just to get internet. HOWEVER. You can get a vpn. \u00a330something for bypassing the ports for games. No torrents though.\n\n\nAlso, shameless plug. I highly suggest joining societies. ACOG, the gaming society, offer a discount to the VPN if you're a paid member. Oh, and be warned.

But the nightlife was ok, especially if you joined a few societies or sports clubs.\n\nLots of pubs, a couple of clubs (of sorts).\n\nThere is a cinema, and the arts centre has regular art exhibitions, comedy shows and theatre productions.",

That no matter what uni you end up going to, to make as much of an effort to speak to your course mates. Whether its by making a facebook group or discord or teams. \nI dont know it will be like in september but even if theres in person stuff again, i doubt there will be socials or freshers in the same way there once was. \nCommunication and getting to know the people you might be working with for the next 3 or 4 years is very important in so many ways.",

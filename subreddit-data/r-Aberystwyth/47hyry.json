    "postText": "Hey :)\n\nI'm part of the Labour Party on /r/MHOC, a simulation of the House of Commons online. We stand \nfor opposition to austerity,\ndemocratisation of the workplace, and a strong public infrastructure \n([here is our manifesto](https://mhoclabour.squarespace.com/)). It's also worth noting that since the collapse of Plaid Cymru in the simulation, the majority of their members have joined Labour, and our 1st preference candidate in Wales is actually one of these ex-members. We're currently having an \nelection, and we'd greatly appreciate it if you would consider voting for us. \nIt'll only take a minute of your time, and it would mean the world to us. You don't have to \nbe British in order to vote! We'd greatly appreciate it if you were to click on \n[this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/), \nchoose a constituency, and vote for the Labour Party candidates. If you're interested in \njoining the Labour Party itself, feel free to \n[click on this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/41tznv/join_a_party/?sort=new), and comment that you'd like to join Labour. Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you have a nice day :)\n\nCheers, /u/AlmightyWibble\n",

    "postText": "Hi there. I need to get my rabbits spayed but I'm struggling to find much information on the vets. I've had trouble with Downes before so I'm hesitant to trust them, but as I have no experience with Ystwyth I'm cautious about them too. Can anyone offer me some information or advice? \n\nThank you!",

I dunno what in particular...just something about the receptionists that aggravated me.",

            "comment": "Hi there! I am a second-year Economics Major at Aber! What should you know before you come? A lot of  practical things, obviously, as with any uni! You'll learn very quickly anyway, if you ask the right people &amp; network a bit.\nBut I'll try to focus on the course! You'll have almost all lectures &amp; seminars at the Llanbadarn campus, which is a pleasant 20 minute stroll from the main,vibrant Penglais campus, through some very quiet peaceful, domestic yet rural feeling Welsh suburbia. Llanbadarn itself has more the feeling, in the buildings, of a subdued high school or 6th form college. There are currently no halls of residence there, but there are two nice catering outlets, one of which is in the Padarn building, &amp; a large, well stocked University library along with the SMB &amp; Law department buildings. It goes without saying that Aber is ultra safe &amp; a beautiful, spatially open yet cosy, friendly student-focused town which although far from the outside world has all necessary amenities, including a general hospital, supermarkets, nightclubs, pubs, restaurants, cafes a busy high street with many national brand name chains, the Arts centre with frequent comedy &amp; music gigs, a politically active students union, a mini cinema et al.\nAber's BSc Economics modules are very \"vanilla\" in content, in other words modules here very similar to modules of Economics courses in other top universities. \nModules are delivered traditionally through Lectures (power points &amp; recordings of which are uploaded to Blackboard, a VLE) &amp; group seminars with Q &amp; A, exercise completion or presentational formats.\nYou are assessed mostly from Exams but most modules use coursework (3000 word essays etc) &amp; seminar work/attendance as added factors\nContent is very straightforward, especially in the first year. You have Intro Macro &amp; Micro, which covers pretty much the whole A level Econ syllabus &amp; then some extra, in half the time. You have Applied economic policy &amp; research analysis in European Economics &amp; Hot Topics. Then you have the 3 Maths &amp; Statistics modules, which cover important formulas &amp; operations for second &amp; third year modules, these are commonly also found in AS level Mathematics modules, such as C1, C2, &amp; S1. You then have a choice of 30 extra credits in subjects related to Econ, which may give you extra skills that could prove useful. As I have a Separate minor subject, I didn't do any of those, but I'm fine with 2nd year anyhow, oh &amp; the 2nd &amp; 3rd year modules, core &amp; optional (SO MANY OPTIONS!) are great too.\nIf you have any other specific questions, let me know!!",

You'll be walking up and down Penglais hill potentially several times a day, depending on your timetable and how social you are.\n\nSocieties are a good way to make friends, there's a facebook page for most of them.\n\nTry and have a good idea of your alcohol tolerance before Fresher's week. Pubs here are separated by thirty second walks, you can pretty easily ruin your night because there's no rest and you didn't pace yourself.\n\nOther than that I think useful information is dependent on your interests and stuff.",

The main route between the two is pretty shallow &amp; smooth. But if they want a night out or just to go to any place that isn't CK's supermarket or campus, then indeed, they will need to walk (or invest \u00a375 in an annual students bus pass) up &amp; down the steep (but manageable, unlike Cardiac) Penglais hill at least a few times per week.",

It's corrupt, spending money on building a campus in tax haven Mauritius even whilst its own facilities rot and its faculty are harassed. There are some great people here, but you'd be better off going to a uni where your degree will be worth the paper it's written on in a couple of years.",

    "postText": "I'm starting a PhD at Aber in September, currently doing an MA. Looking for someone to buddy up with, housing-wise - most of my friends here are either leaving after their Masters, or are already PhD students with housing sorted. Looking to team up with 1, maybe 2 other like-minded people and find a nice little academic nest! If anyone is in the same position, give me a shout and we can talk more.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI recently firmed up my offer to Aber and am extremely excited to attend in September. I am an international student coming from Canada and have been looking at participating in athletics for the University. Specifically, I am wondering about the work loads of post-graduate programs and whether or not it is manageable to do both. \n\nHere it is doable but can be extremely complicated based on the program (I've known a few people to do it, and a few who had to quit midway through). I am wondering if anyone has had experience with this and/or can give me some advice about it.\n\nI don't really want to lug equipment with me if it's going to be impossible to manage both the athletic and academic schedules.\n\nThanks!",

Sounds like it might suit you as you don't really need much equipment apart from a pair of cleats and a disc. I could link you to their fb group if you like? Or you could just check out their stand at the sports fayre when you arrive.",

I'm not sure really how it works but I was looking more at like inter-university sport (not sure if Ultimate falls into this). Specifically, which I should have mentioned before is the lacrosse program. I've play my whole life, and really want to keep playing. ",

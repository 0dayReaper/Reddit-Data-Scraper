    "postText": "Hey folks, I'm looking for players specifically from Wales or associated with Wales in some way to join our discord and be part of our community. The Welsh Gaming Network aims to bring together devs, streamers, writers and players across Wales, fostering the gaming community here.\n\nWe have an active discord chat and a regularly updated website, here are our links:\n\nhttps://discordapp.com/invite/DyMTjHQ\n\nhttp://www.welshgamingnetwork.co.uk\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/welshgamingnet\n\nWe currently focus on gaming, both PC and console but we have communities that would love more players for the following games:\n\nOverwatch, Minecraft, ARK, League of Legends, CS:GO, Rocket League, PubG, Destiny 2 (soon!)\n\nWhen you join, check out info and rules and it'll show you how to use our bot to add yourself to any (or all!) of the above games, then you'll get access to a room where you can find players to group up with or just chat about the game.\n\nWe also have general chat rooms and talk and play a massive array of games, so if you're not into any of those above, no worries, you can still find a chat!\n\nFinally we arrange event meetups so if you're hankering to make a new friend or two we had folks from age 16 up to their 40s come to the last two, which were a day out at Belong Cardiff and The Arcade Vaults Cardiff, and i61 in Birmingham.\n\nWe're also looking for new writers so if you fancy having a go at writing articles or reviews, drop us a PM or msg Athravan on the discord. There might be some game keys involved!\n\nHope to see you on the discord soon, but if you don't do Discord feel free to follow us on Twitter for gaming news across Wales.",

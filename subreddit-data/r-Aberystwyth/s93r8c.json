    "postText": "I\u2019ve been admitted to attend Aberystwyth University this fall for postgraduate studies and I have done some browsing of apartment rentals online. Does anyone know of any agencies that tend to be more pet friendly, specifically for a well-behaved adult cat? I have 4 years rental history with her here in the US, but it seems like they are a bit more heavy handed with no pet policies in the listings that I\u2019ve seen so far. If anyone has any tips, they\u2019d be appreciated, thank you!",

            "comment": "In my experience the more rural listings are at least open to negotiations. Try 1stop Lettings on Terrace Road, but be upfront and ask if they have any lettings who would consider pets. \nOther than that private landlords tend to stick to the classifieds in the local newspaper, The Cambrian News. I'll check this week's and let you know if I see anything promising",

It's been ages since I've subscribed to any kind of newspaper, and they've always been local to me so they came physically. \n\nI wouldn't be seriously looking to put down a deposit until May or June (once funding for the program is finalized) for a September lease start, so I expect it is a bit early to begin calling around and making contact with different agencies and landlords. Thank you for your advice!",

I have a dog, as do 3 other people renting flats in the same property managed by MS.\n\nIts worth contacting the estate agents directly to discuss pet friendly accommodation as sometimes they are willing to offer accommodation that preciously stated 'no pets' (informing them you are postgrad/mature student helps as the landlord may be more likely to accept a pet than if they think you are an undergrad). You may be required to put down an extra deposit, provide a letter of recommendation/support form your current landlord (to prove cat is well behaved and cared for), or pay for full cleaning when you leave.  \nAlso, having a cat may limit you to ground-floor only flats, or houses with direct garden access so the cat has easy access to get outside.",

My cat is strictly indoor only, so hopefully, that won't limit me to ground floors (though I'm not necessarily opposed to a ground floor unit). \n\nThank you for the advice and the recommendation!",

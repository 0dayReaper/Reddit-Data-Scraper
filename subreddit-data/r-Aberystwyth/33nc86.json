    "postText": "I'm currently the only tenant-to-be of a 5-bed house in Waun Fawr, two minutes walk from campus. Bills are included at \u00a385 a week, though council tax isn't so we're all going to have to be students most likely. It's a good quality semi-detached house, all of the rooms a decent size, and over the summer the central heating is to be entirely replaced so that should be nice and efficient. On the off chance anyone is interested, it'd be great to hear from you. I do need to find other tenants because if it's just me in the house I can't be sure that the contract won't be cancelled before it begins. I'll be here over summer, working full time hopefully. Hear from you soon hopefully. :)",

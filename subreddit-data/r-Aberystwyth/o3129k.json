Pls hit me up with your recs, or anywhere else you think is tops to eat that may still have a table going on Sunday\u2026! Diolch yn fawr iawn",

Nice enough but I've had better elsewhere.\n\nFusion King I think has curry on the menu but that's not necessarily it's main thing. \n\nGood pub grub at the Glengower and if you want something fancy then try Medina though be warned, your bank account won't thank you.",

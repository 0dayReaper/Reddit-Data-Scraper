Links to other towns isn\u2019t horrendous, but if you\u2019re trying to get beyond walking / cycling distance of Aber but remain within the Mid Wales area you really are limited without a car. Having lived here without a car, and lived here with a car I can definitely say my quality of life is better for having one. \n\nThat\u2019s the downside covered. For the upside, because our road network is pretty terrible you can end up in some incredible places just by walking or cycling for a couple of hours and them be truly remote.",

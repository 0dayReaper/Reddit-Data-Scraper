            "comment": "Cant spesk for the french but the maths is really good(so far)\nAnd as for libraries in non covid times there are plenty of libraries in the uni. As well as the town library.\nThe architecture as stated above is quite industrial/brutalist but the main plaza is really quite nice in my opinion. And the physical sciences building looks pretty cool too.\nThe national library of wales is at the bottom of campus and both the interior and exteirer is absolutely beautiful kind of victorian(?). Grand and intricate details everywhere",

Architecture is quite pretty around town, especially the old college, but on campus it's mostly just crusty old brutalist buildings. Nice place to be but definitely not the prettiest of buildings",

However the campus library is great. 24hr access if needed aswell as the option to get books bought (at no cost to you) if they dont already have them. The town is nice in areas and the seafront is beautiful. The Wepsh national library is something else though. You just have to register and you get access to most of the stuff there. Including old dairies and stuff which can be interesting depending what youre researching.",

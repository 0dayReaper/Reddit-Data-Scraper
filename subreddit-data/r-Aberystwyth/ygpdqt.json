And to any trans students, I am currently heavily considering transitioning and would like to know whether there are any university councellors/therapists I would be able to talk to to get started?\n\nMany thanks for any help :)",

            "comment": "Honestly, Aber was amazing for LGBT stuff. I helped organise the first gay pride the town had when I was there and it was met with lots of support. The uni LGBT society was pretty big (there used to be thirty or forty people at socials, and they had loads of stuff going on), which was great. Dunno if it's still the same, but mental health services were never Aber's strong point- hopefully that's better now, but I remember the trans friends I had always complaining that it was impossible to get appointments to see anyone. Hope that helps (although it might be slightly out of date, I left six years ago \ud83d\ude02)",

            "comment": "Ooh hoo hoo, a question for me! \n\nI'm a trans, queer Aber student, and I absolutely love it here. It's casually referred to as the gay capital of Wales among my friends, very understandably. \n\nThe pride society is solid, and very passionate about making life better for students. They're always running campaigns improving things, like trying to get an LGBTQ+ option for uni accom, handing out locations of gender neutral loos on campus (there are many) and when I asked them to add a couple more loos to their list, they fixed it within the day.\n\nFor trans issues, there's an accessibility and inclusion officer who works with pretty much every trans person on campus. She's helped me update my name on the uni system so nobody can see my deadname, plus let me know that parents can't see that if I don't want them to, she does so much great work. \n\nFor the record, I also started a student group called queer++ for LGBTQ+ computer science students which is going pretty well. There's over 50 students in that group 'cause there's a significant overlap between compsci and big gay. Not sure if other departments have anything like that, but compsci lecturers have talked to me about that group and we have full support from the department, and they want to help wherever possible.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask more questions, I'll try my best to answer :)",

If you wanna transition on the NHS, that's where I'd point you to, say you want an appointment about transgender things, and the doctor there who specialises in that will walk you through all that.\n\nIf you don't wanna wait at least 2 years for trans things and have money, you might wanna go private. I don't have any expertise there, but there are so many trans meetups/group chats/discords/private trans channels in queer spaces, that you will *definitely* find someone here who can talk you through their private HRT/surgeries. I know about 5 people who openly have private HRT and they're all super friendly and willing to talk others through it. \n\nAnd no problem! Always happy to help :)",

You will need to get signed up to a local surgery anyway, may as well make sure it is Padarn!\n\nIf there is anything else you'd like to know that no one has answered, please do let me know!",

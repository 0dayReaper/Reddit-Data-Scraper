I travelled to london recently and it was unexpectedly 7 hours and a bit more. A nightmare.",

If you wanna do it I would suggest the train as you\u2019re gonna need to work while you travel most likely.\n\nI think personally it is too much, if you were gonna commute from Shrewsbury it might be ok but London I think is too far IMO.",

I believe the trains for one are verrry expensive to get there, but if money is not an issue then that doesn't matter. But there's also the time, which can be very draining. I used to visit London maybe every term, so every 2 months, which worked for me. But it is a looong long way",

With travel in London, it was an entire day's worth of travel. Are you willing to lose a day each week to travel? That is before you factor in the high potential for delays in Birmingham and line issues between Shrewsbury and Aber.",

Really time consuming, trains are expensive and as other comments mention regularly disrupted service. Honestly unless its for something really important I'd avoid it if you can and i certainly wouldn't recommend doing it every week! Aber is great so my advice is go back to the big smoke once a month tops.",

Then if you factor in any issues or delays. That's a full day of travel each way. Which isn't sensible.\n\n\n\nJust had a look on Google, and with a 9 o clock start on a weekday, the train will take just under 10 hours. [London to Aber Google time](https://iili.io/BmYNdQ.png)",

Also, there were several occasions where I could not be bothered and ended up staying longer than planned on one side or the other. Also consider the commute time when you actually get to London. I arrived in Paddington but had to make my way to Camden afterwards. That final segment was a killer, cost, time, and energy. Both top notch places, but sadly from Aber I'd chose one or the other, it'd be easier going from Edinburgh or penzance than Aber given the trains.",

I can confirm I've had to work on New Years Day before.   \n\n\nWe do run a different time table on Sundays (which Jan 1st 2023 is) so the trains are less frequent.  \n\n\nI will say bank holidays are much more likely to have disruption/ delays from past experience. Particularly around christmas.",

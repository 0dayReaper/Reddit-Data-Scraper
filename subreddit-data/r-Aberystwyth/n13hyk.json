I hope you don't take this as criticism as it isn't intended to belittle your effort, but instead a couple of things that I think could improve it in keeping with the Tolkien-esque style. I think it would be great to include some of the smaller locations that play parts in Welsh mythology such as Y Mabinogion, Y Gododdin and the writings of the likes of Gildas, Nennius and Geoffrey of Monmouth, as those are a huge part of Welsh cultural history / identity and also match up nicely with the mythical theme of the map.\n\nI would also have the Welsh names above English, as a lot of Tolkien's works were inspired by Wales and the Welsh language, also in recognition of the language being the language of Wales.",

Yes I was copying Tolkien's use of using Elvish place names after the English ones, which I only thought of in the middle of the drawing process. I'm sure it's a map I will revise in the near future!",

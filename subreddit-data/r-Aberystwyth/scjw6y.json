He never actually served in the military.\n\nHe taught strategic studies, military history, intelligence, and 20th-century French political history. \n\nAsk a member of staff who has been there a long time. \n\nMartin is a very, very sweet and kind man. He was also the stereotypical eccentric professor.",

Internationally, Aber is world renowned for Interpol due to the immense quality and research of its department - which founded the discipline in the first place - and it's usually seen as rather weird when someone studying Interpol hasn't heard of the university. When I looked around the university and watched a mock seminar and introduction to the course, the event and the place overall was excellent and it was evident the professors/doctors, lecturers and political scientists were at the top of their discipline and were extremely proud to be working there (most of which were from different countries). Aber is the founding university for Interpol, and consistently ranks Number 1 for the subject WORLDWIDE, known by the highest ranked universities in the world for the topic. I've consistently been told that you'll get a better Interpol experience at Aberystwyth than you would at Oxford, Cambridge and St. Andrews - and even LSE when it comes to teaching quality. Over 65% of Interpol textbooks are written by Aberystwyth professors and political scientists too. So yeah, that's where I got my \"ideas from.\" \n\nAs for you, seriously, you're totally wrong and out of the mark, and likewise: I don't know where you even got your idea from.\n\nYour university almost always ranks as Number 1 in The Times for teaching quality and always ranks in the top 5 or 1 worldwide for student satisfaction. I don't know, maybe you're hanging around the wrong people?",

Just go out with a budget, seriously I've drank away most of my lucrative Bursary over the last 2 years.\n\n* All the societies and sports teams are generally welcoming to freshers, don't be afraid to join a sports club/society. There are a lot of stories that fly about regarding initiations and what not, they're only partly true. Initiations are a lot more tame than they're made out to be though.\n\n* Go to the fresher fayres. Get as much free stuff as possible. \n\n* Get on the housing market early, there are lots of really dodgy letting agents and landlords in Aber. Some are genuinely great but you don't want to be paying \u00a395 to sleep in a tiny room with no internet like in Abergeldie. (Though it's a lot better now Emyr has been done for fraud).\n\n*  Andy's Records (at the bottom of Penglais Hill) sell tickets to Union events usually. Saves you having to trek to Campus for a Reload ticket. (I don't care what people say, Reload is class).\n\n* Ow's cabs. That is all.\n\n* Required reading is laughable. If you can't get the book for less than \u00a320 it's probably not the right book or is over-priced. Take it from me who spent \u00a3100 on literature in my first year, they don't really help.\n\n* There's a guy who sells DVD's &amp; CD's next to the student Union on Wednesdays, they're good value and he sells some amazing rare live albums and B-sides. Good guy.\n\n* I'm running out of things to say, message me if you want to know anything else.  ",

Student nights in aber suck to an impressive extent. \n\nGet out into the countryside and pick some mushrooms as soon as you arrive. Also generally just get out and enjoy the scenery as much as possible because that is all there is. I have known people moan about a lack of things to do in aber because they have moved from various cities. I just moved to a city and I miss being abke to get out into the middle of nowhere almost every day.\n\nHope you enjoy your stay.",

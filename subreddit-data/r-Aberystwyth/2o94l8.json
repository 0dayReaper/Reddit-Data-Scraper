    "postText": "I know this sub is mainly populated by students, but local legends Aber Jazz (a trad jazz band formed 42 years ago) are playing their last gig in rummers on Saturday. \n\nThey have a couple of original members including their drummer who is 85 and plays like he's hooked up to a car battery. It will be a great night and a chance for you uni folk to meet locals of your age, who are the people you need to know in terms of free parties, raves etc come spring.",

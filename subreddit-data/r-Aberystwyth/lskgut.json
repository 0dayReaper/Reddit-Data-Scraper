            "comment": "Aber is weirdly lively and diverse for where it is. There\u2019s a lot going on, a lot of amazing, eccentric people, and a quiet sense of community and cohesion.\n\nAll of that, and the amazing natural spaces that are all around it; the coast, rolling into the river valleys, and then slowly dispersing into the hauntingly bare Elenydd.\n\nI went to school in Aber, and this is just my hypothesis, but I think that it\u2019s always been helped by the fact it has the only big schools around. Some of my best friends lived in Gwynedd and Powys, not even Ceredigion! So there were a lot of geographic differences squished together, which extends to people coming to shop, study, go on nights out. I don\u2019t think you get that in many towns of Aber\u2019s size in other parts of the UK. There\u2019s also no obvious class divide in Aber or Ceredigion as a whole. Maybe that\u2019s because there\u2019s no private schools - there\u2019s nothing wrong with them, but they segregate people based on class and create a lot of cultural animosities because of that. I have rich mates, even though I didn\u2019t come from much - I was shocked to find out that basically doesn\u2019t happen in many parts of the South East, it creates a lot of cultural disparity which I\u2019m glad isn\u2019t the case in Aber. I could go on about that, but I won\u2019t!\n\nAdd to that the uni - I love Aber when the students are back, they bring so much life that wouldn\u2019t be there without them. The uni and the hospital make it really culturally diverse, too. I went to Welsh lessons alongside Syrian refugees - where else does that happen? Aber\u2019s dodged the fate of a lot of other seaside towns, and it\u2019s got so many little nooks and crannies that I\u2019ve always loved looking around and exploring - twenty years here and I still find somewhere new now and again!\n\nBest place in the world.",

I've learned so much about living on my own here, and the ability to walk to stores is awesome! I think next year will be better (I'm at the university), but even as dead as it is there's always something to do.",

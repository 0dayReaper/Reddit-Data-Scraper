Do you think they fixed the exchange with all the work going on?\n\nLast year our speed was 800KB/s download. Same house and contract. ",

It was okay for the small stuff, but if I wanted to watch any videos or online TV (didn't have a telly, either), I had to go to Pantycelyn and commandeer one of their computers (as I did with Sherlock - watched them all in one sitting after my exams - brilliant)",

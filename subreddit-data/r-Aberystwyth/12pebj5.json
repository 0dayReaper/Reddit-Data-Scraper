I am a Bengali-Canadian \"hick\" and also a just a little fella so I just have a few questions for you folks!\n\n1. Will my race be a problem??\n2. Will the fact I sound like an American Texan be a problem??\n3. Is my height going to be a problem??? (Heightism in dating (5'3) / Will I get mugged for being a hobbit)\n4. What are the biggest cultural shocks I should expect from Aberystwyth/ AberUni???\n\n Thanks for your time!!!",

Certainly we are much more similar to each other than for example the US and Canada are to each other. As with all places you\u2019ll find some (generally older) people who are racially intolerant or even outright racist, but amongst the younger crowd especially the students I\u2019d be amazed if you found anyone who has a problem with you for being non white. \n\n2. Nope. For bonus points learn some Welsh, people love hearing it spoken with an American accent!\n\n3. No more than it would be in Canada I guess? I don\u2019t know anyone who has been mugged here, definitely not something to worry about. \n\n4. Honestly probably not as much as you\u2019re probably expecting. The sense of humour is probably the biggest difference but you\u2019ll get used to us!",

(we really need a tongue-in-cheek emoji.)\n\nSeriously, remember that you're coming to a country and a culture which is very used to having people from outside coming in, to the extent that the majority of students are not from that country. Also, any instance of bullying is treated very seriously by the university. It's not that it never happens, but it's certainly not tolerated within our community.",

So I know Aberystwyth very well, and I also know my rural community very well, and I don't see any of what you describe here, except in a few crackpots (that's Mike Parker's word for them in one of his books, but I've met them) who moved to rural Ceredigion from English cities because they are racists.\n\nYou've just brought up the topic of skin colour; why did you do that? Remember, we're specifically talking about Aberystwyth here; I can tell you this, Aberystwyth people are almost universally colour-blind. I hear plenty of English people claiming (usually without reason of course) that they've faced racial discrimination, but I don't recall ever hearing it of someone from overseas, except for these crackpots. And both in my job and in my political activities, I probably would if it were a thing.",

There were a few racist incidents but they were all along the lines of \"your not Welsh\" instead of \"your not white\" and was mostly just one incredibly awful guy who attacked random people including hospital staff for not speaking Welsh.\n\nThe summer tends to get a load of dick tourists being assholes to everyone and everything but they are limited to only a month or two.

There are so many cultures and people from all walks of life there. It did feel like a nice little tucked away hub in the heart of Wales.\n\nI never did really find any other bengali students though during my time there. Never thought of it as a problem though. The Indian restaurants in town are ran by bengalis and they're very welcoming too. Everyone will find it so cool that you're from Canada. Try join a society whilst your down there, it's a great way to meet people.\n\nOh and the biggest shock, the hills. Get ready to do some heavy cardio traversing them bad boys.\n\nFeel free to message me if you want to know more about my time there or just want a general chat anyway!",

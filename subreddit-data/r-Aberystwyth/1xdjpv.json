    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI have my conditional offer and I'm a fairly introvert \"mature student\". I've been told that Penbryn has good sized rooms but I'm wondering about noise levels (specifically for sleeping). Can anyone give any insight about noise and such? I've been to university in the past but part-time and lived at home. Additionally, are there any other areas that you'd recommend I consider that have rooms with good size that may be quieter?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: To anyone else who has a similar question - I've been in Pentre Jane Morgan for a semester now and it's a good choice. 5-6 people to a house and I've been lucky enough to be with people closer to my age and older.",

You're in a self contained house which is nice rather than the free for all hustle and bustle of flats, but you obviously still have neighbours if you want to broaden out beyond house mates. I was slightly older than my house mates and quite introvert when I moved in first year to PJM too, so can recommend on that side too.",

And to be fair the other rooms in pjm were comparable with Rosser if not a little bigger. If you're really lucky some of them have double size rooms, though then again they may have turned them into bunk rooms now. Just as another point, with Rosser it can be a bit too easy to be like ships that pass in the night with flat mates, a friend of mine only met his housemates 2 weeks in after they discovered a hitherto unseen hungover bearded man eating beans out of the can. With pjm it's easy enough to have your privacy, but the way it's layed out makes it easier to call through to people in their rooms, which keeps things friendly. To be honest you'll have a good time wherever you end up, I think people get a little tribal about which halls is best :p   The important thing is to get your second year accommodation sorted asap, don't leave it till after Christmas, there isn't enough in town for everyone, and you don't want to end up in a bnb!

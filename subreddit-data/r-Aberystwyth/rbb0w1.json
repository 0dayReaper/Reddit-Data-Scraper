My room was cramped, cold, and about as en suite as having a bucket.\n\nWhen I moved in the room clearly hadn't been cleaned. They tried to fob me off but I stood my ground. \n\nThe 2 previous years I'd been in Rosser (not the fancy then-new block). Small rooms, but it was clean, warm, had a properly functioning shower and toilet, and a really nice, light, big kitchen with a view of the bay.",

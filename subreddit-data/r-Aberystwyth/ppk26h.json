            "comment": "The Pier Hotel (not to be confused with pier) - About average, small, but do drinks with 4 shots and nice atmosphere  \nKanes - good place to go to chill, great cider selection  \nWhite Horse - apparently good but never seen a student end up here  \nLibertine,Cwtsh SY23 - Both very nice places for cocktails but you'll only end up here a few times a year  \nSpoons - its spoons  \nCambrian - Excellent fun cocktails, absolutely go here. Favourites are refreshers vodka and fizz wizz or the death star if you want to get hammered (comes as 2 pints, drink one with a mate)  \nBar 46 - Spacious so large groups end up here quite a lot, good food and decent for drinks if a bit more expensive than other places/leaning more towards club pricings for some stuff   \nRummers - Good drinks, not too expensive, great atmosphere and decent amount of space  \nAngel - see other comment  \nThe Mill - \u00a31 jager bombs, no one comes here for anything else  \nDownies - Cheapest strong drinks in aber. the toilets here were probably the source of corona.  \nHarleys - Really good atmosphere and drinks, is a semi club vibe most busy nights but closes early at 1pm and only has a small dance floor, good music though for a club.  \nScholars - Nice pub and popular if a bit out of the way from a usual night out, not too much to say about it.  \nInn on the pier, known as Inn on, More expensive for drinks than some places but quite nice tbh, does some nice food I think. Open the latest I believe out of any popular pub.  \nPier Pressure - The only real nightclub in aber after yokos closed/turned into some upmarket and dead expensive wine bar (rip). Closes somewhere between half 2 and 4 most nights, only open the busy nights in aber (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday). Drinks here will break your wallet if you get more than 2 vks, but as a club its pretty decent.  \n\n\nTheres probs more I've forgotten/not been to that are still good",

Recommend going out on a Vodka Tuesday or sports night Wednesday with a society or sports club and they will take you on a pub crawl and you can see what vibe you fancy",

Not a nice place\n\n\nCambrian is making a turnaround but they have a lot of work to do before it's actually nice to be in but the drinks are nice.\n\n\nAvoid the mill, I've been there twice and each time, there was police called to the pub for some reason or other.\n\n\nSpoons is cheap and easy but usually busy\n\n\nThe SU bar is hopeless and never really has a vibe. Cheap drinks and not much else.\n\n\nDon't drink in pier. They charge near double price for drinks and food. Pier pressure is good to go clubbing (since yokos left) but not much else",

Rummers was pretty good too.\n\nPool ship and castle, drunk pool academy.\n\nThe mill was only ever good for shots.\n\nGelngower for hangover beers.\n\nI suspect this is all very out of date but man it was always a fantastic night out",

Owners are friendly and the service is excellent.   \nAnother good place to drink to escape/avoid the student crowd is Scholars. Although the music in Scholars has improved this year so it may attract more students this time. Who knows...",

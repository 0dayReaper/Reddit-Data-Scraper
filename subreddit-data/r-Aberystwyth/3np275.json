    "postText": "\n\nHello everyone,\n\nA bit of an introduction for you: /r/MHoC is a political simulation game, where political nerds (and people who are fans of arguments generally) get together and discuss/roleplay politics.\n\nI am the Welsh Liberal Democrats (Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol Cymru) Candidiate for Wales, as well as the parties Deputy Leader. \n\nAs a party, the MHoC Liberal Democrats differs somewhat from our real-life counterparts. For a start we currently have more than 8 MPs (ahem), and we're somewhat more radical on the liberal side of things. We don't sit between the Tories and Labour - we are a genuine liberal option, with a focus on completely restructuring the economy, protecting our civil liberties and really going for it on digital rights.\n\nAlso, worry not, we're definitely not a bunch of [Nick Cleggs](http://nickclegglookingsad.tumblr.com/).\n\n****\n\nWhen it comes to Wales, we are, as Liberals in Britain have been for a long time, passionate supporters for Devolution, Federalism and Home Rule for all. If the practical possibility ever came up (there are currently meta issues around activity meaning it isn't happening), that there would be a Model Welsh Assembly, we would passionately support it. \n\nWe want to make Britain a federal state, with the People of each of the Home Nations being given powers over the issues that matter to them. But at the same time we are passionate believers in the Union, and believe that together we are stronger.\n\n[United We Stand, Divided We Fall](http://i.imgur.com/hvMNete.png)\n\n\n****\n\n###[Our Manifesto](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzzNbsd_cthRNHFiNG9NekVwMjg/view)\n\nThere is a page on Wales on one the last view pages. \n\n****\n\n##[Click here to vote in the General Election!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/3ni7z5/general_election_iv_megathread/)\n\n\n\n\nOf course I'd quite like you to **Vote Liberal Democrat** and, even better, join us on /r/MHoC! Our primary motivation is to have a bit of a laugh while having some heated debate, so it's something that should appeal to most redditors I think.\n\nThank you.\n",

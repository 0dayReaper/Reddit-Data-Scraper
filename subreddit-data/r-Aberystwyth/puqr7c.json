    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm a masters student at the uni working in town. I've had a few people asking for help for the WiFi or setting up devices so I'm here to offer help\n\nIf it's a games console then it needs to go on the PAU-IOT network. In order to connect you need to register it's mac address with the university.\n\nIf it's a laptop, desktop or mobile then you need to connect to the eduroam network. This is a bit more complex as you need to setup the network config which can be found on the university FAQs.\n\nIf it's a Google home/chrome cast/alexa, these all don't work on the university network and there is no way to get them working.\n\nIf you are having any trouble, drop into Welsh Computers in town and they should be able to help you or even if your looking to buy a new laptop.\n\nStay safe and enjoy freshers week.",

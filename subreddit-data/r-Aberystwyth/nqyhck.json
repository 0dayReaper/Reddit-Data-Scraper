What I'm not so knowledgeable about is the area around Aberystwyth, so does anyone know any good wild camping spots within a 15 - 30 min drive from the town where you're unlikely to get caught or run into other campers?\n\nI've found a tonne of spots in and around the Swansea Valley and Brecon Beacons so I'd be happy to share if you know some spots. Thanks!",

The further out from Aber the better in your case; there\u2019s no part of Ceredigion that\u2019s truly \u2018wild\u2019 in any meaningful sense, but a lot of it is certainly remote and you\u2019re unlikely to get bothered an hour\u2019s walk out of any village. Most of the county is also private land, so watch out for that.",

If you wanted to keep your eye out for wildcampers though (so you can tell them not to do it again of course.) the best spots would be when you get up in to the Cambrian Mountains around Pumlumon. You're very unlikely to find anyone though because they're relatively quiet hills. \n\nIf you were to find someone wild camping, I'm sure they would be in a small discrete tent or bivvy bag treating the area with the utmost respect and never as a place for a party. You would never find them camping in fenced off fields or woodlands, and would likely only ever find them in open country.",

I do, however, fully respect the laws of \"Leave No Trace\" as I do not wish to harm the wild. All I'm saying is, if the Welsh Government wishes to keep wild camping illegal because of \"damage to the environment\" yet allows cars, planes, pesticides, coal, factories, plastic, and maaaaaaaaany others to be used and abused across our land then I fully support ignoring the illegalisation of wild camping. Plus, with the increased costs and restrictions imposed by campsites all across Wales, why the hell would I want to go camp legally?",

There is a legal line in the sand and in this instance it's drawn out in the CRoW Act. Saying \"But I disagree because...\" is no no defence at all if someone were to take you on for it (trespass is civil, not crimal law so it would be a landowner, not the police). If you're going to break the law by wildcamping you need to acknowledge what you're doing is illegal rather than trying to be some sort of edgelord. You might get caught and using some humility and admitting what you did was wrong in the eyes of the law and just taking it on the chin could be your way out, but if you start rattling off about why the person who caught you is wrong, despite the law being on their side, you're going to harm any case you have and put other future wildcampers at risk by having a landowner that might come down heavier on them because of that gobby wildcamper they had that one time. \n\nThe fact is I agree that wildcamping shouldn't be illegal, but I accept that for now it is and if I get caught then I've got to be a big boy and own up to it rather than make excuses.",

Pot smokers know weed is illegal, yet they still smoke because they enjoy it. They aren't gonna make a blatant excuse to an officer like \"I think it should be legal therefore I can smoke it\". That's the same with me. I understand you might not be able to read properly and that's completely fine, but that's what I meant by what I said. Mong lol",

    "postText": "So I'm gonna assume that the vast majority of people in this Sub are people from Aberystwyth, so I just want to give a massive thank you for having such a wonderful, clean (at least the parts I saw) town! I went last summer, hoping to return in October, my cousin (who lives in Machynlleth) showed me around and it was beautiful. Constitution Hill is amazing, so I just wanted to say thanks! Everyone was very friendly, and you have a very beautiful town! Also, when I went (Mid to End of July 2015) I noticed that there was an abundance of Jewish people there: I have no problem with this, but I'm very curious if anyone knows! ",

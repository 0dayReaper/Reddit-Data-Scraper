    "postText": " \n\nPrynhawn da Aberystwyth! My name is Beth and I am currently working on the ASSISTANCE project further south at Cardiff University. We know that this last 18 months or so have placed greater pressure on nurses and nursing students than ever before. Because of this, we are currently doing a survey study to find out the impact of the pandemic on nurses and nursing students' choices about carrying on nursing, their mental health, and their experiences of not being able to give the kind of nursing care they want to give. If this rings true and are a nurse or nursing student who worked in Wales during the pandemic please consider filling in our survey - you can be in any branch of nursing and any field and you do not have to have worked with COVID patients.\n\nThe survey link is here: [https://cardiff.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/the-assistance-study](https://cardiff.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/the-assistance-study?fbclid=IwAR2r2Ep-vjod3FjXlPY5QDuRjOsCm6SsmnMdOz4wGiQWL8ZMHfyEC-wUOfs) and every completion counts as we are trying to reach 3000 responses! Thank you for your time, please do share the survey with colleagues, friends, and families so they can share their experiences too!\n\nBeth",

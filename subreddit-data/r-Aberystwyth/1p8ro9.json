    "postText": "I'm posting this partially in the vague hope someone might be able to help me out, but largely just as a warning. However great you do or don't think aber is, it is utterly, utterly appalling at anything remotely not the conventional course.\n\n\nI took a Gap Year, and thank fuck it wasn't specifically for stress or mental health reasons. You'd think it's a reasonably common practice, or at least well known right? Apparently not in aber! The university has *no* system in place for people who just want to defer their course for a year, and have utterly failed to do their jobs (Imo, at least) every step of the way.\n\n\nThe only way to 'take a gap year' is to take a 'temporary withdrawal', which is generally what people do in emergencies like deaths, or if they're seriously considering leaving. I wound up trying to explain to almost every member of staff involved that I wasn't leaving for good, just taking a **gap year**. And *still* very nearly wound up removed from the course part-way through my year. If you take a 'temporary withdrawal', it's effective immediate. So trying to get the hassle and panic of taking yourself out of the system early is the worst possible thing. I *almost* left part-way through january, were it not for the one sane guy in the office who thought to use common sense and check I still wanted to complete second year.\n\nIt will also cost you around \u00a3600, right off the bat, just for the privilege of leaving. And **no one tells you**. Because the uni withdrew me on the 1st of june, Student Finance saw fit to reclaim funds for the three months I wasn't part of the uni. Now, whether you agree or disagree with it (I disagree), the point is at no point, anywhere, did *anyone* let me know something like this would happen. And more importantly, if I'd known and sent off the forms in september...I would still have that money.\n\n\n\nSo, now we come to today. the week to apply for uni accommodation is coming up, and unsurprisingly I'd like to live with my friends in my final year in uni accommodation together.\n\nAlso unsurprisingly. This is a foreign concept to accommodation and the academic office. I'm not eligible to apply yet because I'm withdrawn, and have no access to email, and the academic office are refusing to 're-admiss' me now, I have to contact them in 'early july' to begin the process. So clearly it's not like withdrawing and I have to do it the day before I return. The dates given are apparently arbitrary, my initial email was told to contact them again early july. After pushing further, they've 'discussed it at length with accommodation', and the date is now early may. Both of which are far too late to apply for uni accommodation....or private accommodation. So far the only 'reason' I've been given is that it's almost a full calendar year before I'm recorded to start back. Despite the fact we apply for uni accommodation almost a full calendar year beforehand as well.\n\nThere is no mechanism to get you 'back' into the system. If you take a gap year, there's no \"gap year\" button or system that lets you apply for accommodation. If you choose to take a gap year, apparently you are the *only* person who can **not** apply for accommodation. Everyone else can, people on a year abroad are *guaranteed* accommodation. *You* have to wait six months after the application period closed and hope half the freshers have died.\n\n\nSo, now I'm sat here in australia, unable to actually enjoy a **gap** year because I'm too busy trying to work out where the hell I'm going to live next year, sending emails and wasting money on international phone calls because the staff ignore my emails.\n\n\nI'd love any support or help anyone could suggest. But in part this is a warning to anyone wanting to take a gap year. Don't. Or be prepared to deal with boatloads of stress.",

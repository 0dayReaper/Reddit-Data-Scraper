There's a free bus to morrisons a couple times a week or you can walk into town (take a taxi back, that hill is awful to walk up!). Theres also a shop near the campus for small shopping trips. There's some nice walks in the area but I wouldn't know much about going for proper hikes. There is a train station too if you're worried about going to/ from home. Let me know if you have any other questions",

There's not a lot of parkong spaces around town - most are limited to an hour or so on the street, although some of the little retail 'parks' have 2 or 3hr parking. Buses run often enough to and from town and campus so you dont have to walk up the hill - year passes are availavle for students too I think. There's also a taxi rank nr the train station if you need transport late (after a night out). Trains do run, but there's only one platform, so it's not like there's one every 5mins to somewhere!\nI have a car myself, and when I was studying here, we were lucky to get a 3rd yr place with parking at the house - where I live is not easy to get to with public transport so I felt I needed to take my car with me (I was also in halls 1st and 2nd yr, so paid for uni parking)",

You get used to the hills pretty quickly. I'm a Londoner originally too and the buses here are substantially more reliable than in London - they aren't as regular, but won't get cancelled because they are essential transport for villages in the countryside. This means they can take you to all kinds of random hiking locations; the T2 bus is particularly great as it takes you through the middle of Southern Snowdonia. There's also a [uni hiking club](https://facebook.com/aberhike) that uses minibuses and car shares in non-covid times in addition to public transport that you could join.",

There are also some pretty good circular Aber walks: it's a small place so you'll be in the countryside or on the coast in 20 minutes wherever you live.\n\nThe coastal path goes through aber so you can get a bus to the next village down (Llanrhystud) and walk back, or the train to Borth and walk back, or the bus past Borth... these are all stunning walks. There's a fairly frequent bus north/south which doesn't exactly follow the train route so you can get the bus to e.g. Taliesin and walk to Borth for the train back. One day I did the steam train to Devil's Bridge then walked to Borth (25 miles) to catch the train back to Aber.",

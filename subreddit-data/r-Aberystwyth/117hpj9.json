    "postText": "Hello there! I am a third year undergrad student working on my dissertation. My dissertation focuses on the media representation of the trans gender community in Wales and whether or not trans portrayal in the media is having a negative or positive effect on the trans community. For part of my diss, I am looking for participants from Wales (who are transgender or people who don't conform to gender norms) to carry out a survey on trans representation in the media, although I welcome people from all backgrounds to complete the survey if they feel they have something to contribute. \n\n(To complete the survey you must be 18 or over).\n\nBelow I have provided a link to the survey. It will take a few minutes of your time to complete and I thank you in advance for your contributions.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkdqUwrgrVC4kr-W66lR75eT2yub2xqY_XlAPFwPECgpARoA/viewform?usp=sf_link",

    "postText": "Hi all, as the title implies I'm not a city resident and hail instead from the land of Peaky Blinders, silly accents and general okishness that is Birmingham.\n\nThis weekend however, I do plan on visiting for a night with my dad as we check out the uni for a visit day there. Having just done the same in Swansea, Bangor, Plymouth and Liverpool where we had plenty of pints and meals in various places, we're keen to do the same in order to get a good feel of the place. Therefore, I will gratefully be taking any eating and drinking suggestions you have for us pair.\n\nCheers!",

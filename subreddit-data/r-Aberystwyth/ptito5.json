So I\u2019m working on my application for Aberystwyth University and I wanted to come on here and ask if I could read anyone personal statements, or if anyone would like to give some tips! I\u2019m a great writer, but I\u2019ve never written a personal statement before, and wanted to see someone\u2019s who actually went to Aberystwyth! Thanks in advance for any help!",

But they got in. \n\nLook at it as selling yourself as a product, what makes you different from the next candidate? Once you've done that, so long as you get the required grades, you will get a place. Aberystwyth isn't anywhere near as discerning as the big name Universities, so don't stress about it too much",

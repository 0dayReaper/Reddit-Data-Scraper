    "postText": "I am a US student looking to possibly study in Aber in September, but I was wondering how isolated the town is? Everything I've read mentions it's a great community, but are there a lot of opportunities to travel to other parts of the UK? Do trains run regularly? I am planning to get my whole degree here &amp; I'd like to be able to travel around the UK and some of the rest of Europe too.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s an amazing place to be and definitely offers a unique university experience. Being totally honest though, it\u2019s difficult to do the whole Europe thing if you live here. Realistically it\u2019ll take you half a day to travel to London or a long morning to get to Birmingham or Manchester. \n\nIf you wanted to go to Europe it\u2019s an early start to either catch the train to Manchester, Birmingham or London for a flight (you likely won\u2019t get to your destination until that evening, or a full day of travelling to go on the Eurostar). I\u2019ve used the Eurostar, and rail then flights to get to Europe before and with a bit of planning it\u2019s never a major issue, I just always add a day either side of my trip to allow for any delays.\n\nThere is pretty much only a single route out of Aber on the train which generally you change in Birmingham or Shrewsbury for onward travel elsewhere, so most destinations by rail will go through them. You can also get a student rail card to make it cheaper. \n\nThere are also free buses in Wales (The T buses through Trawscymru) which give a good opportunity to explore Wales.\n\nBasically if you want to leave Wales or go beyond Manchester or Birmingham I would allow for an entire day of travelling and make it an overnight trip to visit other places. Entirely doable, but just worth bearing in mind. \n\nPublic transport aside I absolutely love Mid Wales and wouldn\u2019t live anywhere else. It\u2019s not for everyone, and you\u2019ve got to have a love rural life and the ability to live in a funny little bubble to be here, but the people are wonderful, there\u2019s some great eateries and bars opening up in town, some really quirky little things to do in the surrounding area and it\u2019s generally just a very beautiful area.",

Pretty much everything will involve getting the 3 hour train to Birmingham and you can link to pretty much anywhere in the country from there. \n\nCan get to London in 5 hours if you are lucky with connections, if not 7. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGet a car if you want to travel about.",

            "comment": "There are trains running, but only one platform so bear that in mind - I also think they only run every hour or two. If you want to go to North Wales or South Wales, also bear in mind that you would have to go across to Shrewsbury first, and then change trains.\n\nThe buses are quite good - cheaper, but obviously takes more time to get places. The TrawsCymru I've used before was good for getting to North Wales.",

It\u2019s far from other stuff yes. It\u2019s very unique. I had a blast. Even flying to Europe is cheap but gotta get to the airport early and the bus could be more expensive than the flight\u2026 and if your friends want to do hostels\u2026 read up on them. It\u2019s a culture shock.",

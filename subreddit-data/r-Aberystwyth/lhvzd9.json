    "postText": "Hello, we are a group of psychology researchers from the University of Kent, UK. It would be a huge help if anyone interested in participating would fill out our quick survey (18+ years old only) about emotions and vaccinations:\n\n[https://kentpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5zrxlyi5WWdU3Bz](https://kentpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5zrxlyi5WWdU3Bz)\n\nThe survey takes around 10 minutes to complete, and we are happy to respond to any queries or questions. Please private message us to avoid giving away the point of the study to others.\u00a0\n\nThanks for your time.\u00a0\n\n**Edit:** The survey is now closed! Thank you very much for your time, we will be sure to post the results up here when they're ready.\u00a0",

That way I'll at least have somebody when I arrive.\n\nI am queer so if you're not cool with that then don't reply obvi.",

Before he started uni he found a snapchat group for Aberystwyth newbies and chatted to loads of them before they all arrived.  It was great fun watching the locations of them all as they travelled to uni from all over the world.  Maybe you could find something like that group? No help with buddies, but I know you are going to love it there.  Enjoy your new adventure.",

There was a protest a few weeks ago as well trying to stop the university closing the welsh speaking halls of residence.\n\n\n\nThey've already closed the on campus bar which used to be quite a hub of social activity, and it is true that student satisfaction is decreasing.\n\nI personally wouldn't advise anyone to come here, I can understand why they chose an open day to do it on.",

There are many degrees taught entirely through Welsh, so it figures that it would be good to provide accommodation along those lines too.\n\nPantycelyn has been a brilliant space not only for students to live in, but also containing spaces to help foster other aspects of the Welsh identity. For example: I was chatting to the Union's Welsh Language Officer yesterday and she was saying how in Pantycelyn there is something like 6 decent sized rooms that can be used for all sorts of different activities. She used the example of the Welsh choir, which has something like 100 members. In the new halls that they plan to move Welsh speaking students into, however, there's only something like 2 small rooms available for stuff like this.\n\nThere's also a bunch of other grievances such as rumours that the Uni is planning to use the Pantycelyn building as a sort of academic hotel.\n\nPantycelyn isn't about segregating Welsh speaking students, many choose to live in  mixed halls, but having the option there makes Aberystwyth a pretty unique place (pretty sure no other unis in Wales have such a set up - I may be wrong).\n\nAnd the grievances about Pantycelyn are in the climate of people being pissed off about a multitude of other things with the Uni; Arts Centre, shitty pay rises for staff, overworked PhD students, falling student satisfaction, crappy Union events, blah blah",

Down consti end you do tend to get some big stones kicked up by the waves so they could do some damage. \n\nDon\u2019t be tempted to go for a walk on the prom to watch the storm either! In the 2013/4 winter storm blocks were pushed out of the prom wall that weighed several tonnes, so imagine the damage that a wave like that could do to a human. Honestly that is my biggest piece of advice, stay off the prom.\n\nBasically you have two options. Hole up and watch the storm with a front row seat from the terrifying comfort of your own home, or get some food and drinks and hole up at a mates if they live away from the prom. You\u2019ll probably wake up early as well, so get a good nights sleep.",

If so has the uni given any advice?\n\nBearMcBearFace's advice is totally right.\n\n***Do NOT go for a walk on the prom!***\n\nIf you do have a place to get to away from the prom, probably a better option if you are in uni accommodation with the dodgy as hell windows.\n\nKeep safe, and all the best to you :)",

Whopping big portions too, I've admittedly only been twice but each time we've massively over ordered. (solution - box it up, take it home, whack the rest on a pizza for a hungover lunch.) And it is genuinely affordable on a student budget.",

Because it's tucked away around the back of the pier, it's not the easiest to discover. But it has lush sea views, the food is very very good and some of the wait staff are like.. Phenomenally chirpy and professional haha. I give it my highest regards, cos it's on the pier, and from what I heard the pier is going through some tough times financially, and it would suck if brasserie had to shut down! ",

The 'fusion' tag is a bit of a stretch, but you can get anything from baguettes to quesadillas to ho fun noodles and ice cream fritters for cheap as chips. A fiver will get you a big box (yes, a box, even if you eat in) of some fantastic pad thai, spiced to your liking, best consumed inside at the Formica tables with a bottle of Tsingtao. Champ'yun.",

    "postText": "Safe, \n\nI'm going to be stopping near Aberystwyth for a week with my family from this Saturday (08/06/19), I'll be going to the new skatepark in town because that's my little escape from the family. Is there anyone who'd like to meet up maybe drink beers, smoke weed and sit on the beach? I love spending time with my family but I need to be able to go act like a idiot with some friends and cause some raucous. \n\nAlso if there's any skaters on here I'd like to see some street spots we could go skate? \n\nTIA",

The Kings Hall steps was good for street back in the day but there's a lot of benches there now not to say you can't still skate it! When at the park, ask if Hendrix is around, he'll show you some good spots, he's a short dude with busted up teeth!",

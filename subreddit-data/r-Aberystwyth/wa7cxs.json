Neither of them do food, although you can take takeaways into Bottle &amp; Barrel (there's a good fish place opposite). For good pub food I would recommend going to the Glengower, but as it is on the seafront it will probably be quite busy with tourists, and nowadays it leans more towards restaurant than traditional pub.",

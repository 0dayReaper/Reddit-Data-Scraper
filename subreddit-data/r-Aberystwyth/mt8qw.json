The staff are so helpful, they can advise you on what coffee is best for your tastes, grind it correctly for your needs (different grinds for different coffee makers), and its very reasonable. They also sell interesting teas, a load of coffee making equipment, and the best choclate covered coffee beans you've ever tasted.",

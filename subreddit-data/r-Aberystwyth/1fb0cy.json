    "postText": "Not much to add really. In 117 days I'll be leaving Leeds, possibly forever, to move to Aberystwyth. I'm 21; I'll be 22 when my course starts on the 24th of September. What should I know/do/seek out/avoid? It'd be great to meet people and hopefully make some new friends before I arrive. I'm not an enormously outgoing person and I worry that I'm leaving behind everyone and everything I know to go somewhere where I will be utterly alone forever. So it would be nice to avoid that. :P I've visited the town and uni before and liked it a lot so that's a big part of why I've chosen to move to Aber. But as a somewhat awkward, somewhat nerdy gay guy who likes peace and quiet with no friends anywhere remotely nearby and no family at all, I'd be lying if I said I don't have some concerns. What's the situation with uni digs? I'd move into a privately let property in first year if that would mean I had a more relaxed, tidy atmosphere. But being on campus so close to facilities I'm desperate to avail myself of has a lot of appeal too. I dunno. Any advice you can give would be great!",

            "comment": "I am about to graduate and leave Aber, and there are a few things you should know.\n\n1) Never trust the train into or out of Aber. If you have to be somewhere on a certain day, travel on the day before. My mum just arrived by train and hers was delayed, then cancelled and the replacement bus had to route her through various places to make up for the trains. \n\n2) If you want peace and quiet, do not live anywhere near a pub. On football nights, you can hear the chanting go on for hours. You are better off trying to find a flat amongst locals and postgrads, so on either edge of town, and walking in.\n\n\n3) Join societies. Seriously. You meet so many people with your interests, and if you aren't outgoing, then it allows you to talk to other people without having to run around introducing yourself to everyone. Join a few societies (you can always leave one or two if you are taking up too much time) and you'll make various friends who you can hang out with. \n\n4) Yokos/Why Not is overheated, overpriced and plays terrible music, but for some reason everyone wants to go there. I prefer a pub scene to a club scene, so I avoid Why Not. Pier Pressure is very expensive, but has more space to dance, but is also almost always empty. \n\n5) If you plan to drive, get a house with parking. I cannot stress this enough. This is a very small town, with lots of locals with big off road cars and students with hundreds of cars. You will not be able to find parking if you live in town. You will also not be able to park at uni. The car parks on campus are either for residents or staff and you can't even get a permit if you live in town but not on campus, so you're stuck. If you drive, you might be better off renting something JUST outside Aberyswyth so that you can still apply for a permit. \n\n6) There is a housing crisis. Landlords know that they can rent out their flats at a moments notice, because there are lots of people who are getting desperate. Find a flat as soon as you can, and get it pinned down. Landlords here are generally not great, since they can always get new tenants, so try and keep everything in order, pay on time etc. ",

            "comment": "Spent 3 years in the place, got another year left... I've gone back to the halls for the convenience of it. Some observations are:\n\n* Halls are (well were) pretty chilled. Living up at campus was quite useful for first year but it's fun to get experience of both campus and town. Yeah okay they got messy but some of the smaller places (PJM, for example) seemed slightly better.\n* People are rather tolerant of everything... although the locals may be a bit curt with you if you're obviously a student (they're actually really nice)\n* Travelling is a pain. National express coaches seem pretty cheap, trains are every 2 hours. Driving is possibly the easiest but parking is at a premium.\n* (trying not to sound patronising) Nervousness and apprehension are perfectly normal... I know I felt them in droves when I started but most people are in the same boat.\n* Accommodation for further years can be interesting, if you get the opportunity start looking early, but make sure you know any people you live with. Have a good look around the place too, as with Aber itself houses seem to have certain quirks you may have to deal with. Knowing these earlier rather than later will help you.\n* There are a good number of pubs with different flavours. If you like beer the Ship and Castle is a nice place but it can get busy with locals; the Wetherspoons is actually okay as a place to meet up with people as is Varsity. Rummers is a bit on the expensive side but has some nice outside seating if its not too chilly.\n\n",

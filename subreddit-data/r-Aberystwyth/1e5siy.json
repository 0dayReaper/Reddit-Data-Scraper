    "postText": "Please no rude comments or judgements- I am a junior right now at an american highschool.\nand I am extremely interested in studying in the UK. I am from America. I came across a program called \" Across the Pond\" and am planning on applying with them, they helped me find a few schools.They are pretty much the middle man. I will be studying film, and I came across Aberystwyth University in Wales with a pretty awesome sounding program. I fell in love and that is my top choice school. I am looking for someone just to say anything. Such as general information about the schools reputation, and acceptance rate and flexibility. Is the school easy to get in to ? A good school for film?) I looked it up on google , and it said the acceptance rate is 94 percent. I also talked to a counselor from the school and they said there is a 1:2 serious applicant to acceptance ratio.\nMY PROBLEM: I have a 2.3 GPA. and am anticipating receiving a 20 on my ACT ( and retaking it). ( not sure if any one is familiar with that stuff.. - im not familiar with tariff points or anything) but thats not really good... at all.  I am not sure how much this matters to the school. Does it make a big impact? ( I will be explaining in my personal statement what went wrong in school and how I had a bunch of family stuff and mental stuff going wrong and how that took a huge toll on my grades. My teacher is also writing me a recommendation vouching for me.)\n\n With international students, what are they looking at when they accept you?\nWill my personal statement be the big thing they look at ? They said they look at a student holistically. I am so nervous and this is really the only school I want to get into and go to. I need some sort of answer, reassurance, or just anything. AH. Thanks alot !\nDO I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET IN?",

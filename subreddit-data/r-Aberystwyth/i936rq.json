It would be a huge help if any UK nationals interested would fill out our quick survey (18+ years old only) about yourself and Coronavirus (COVID-19):\n\n[https://kentpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3UvorrLQfqK8HFH](https://kentpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UvorrLQfqK8HFH) \n\nThe survey takes 7-8 minutes to complete, and we're happy to answer any queries or questions you may have.\n\nThanks for your time.",

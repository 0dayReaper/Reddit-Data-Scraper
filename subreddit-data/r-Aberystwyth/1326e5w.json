Also, there is Aber Robotics - they have some robots and stuff that they build, so if you reach out to them with the idea, they might be interested. Also, there are few good lecturers, that are good with robots, so could always reach to them as well - one lecturer has been a judge on Robot Wars, all are super nice, so if you talk to them, I bet they will at least help to set it up :)",

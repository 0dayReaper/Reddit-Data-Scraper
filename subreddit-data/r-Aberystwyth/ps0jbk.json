    "postText": "I'm a college student from the US and I'm looking at studying abroad in the Spring semester of 2022. I was hoping to get some insight on the university and town. Overall what the town is like and what the experience at the university is? I know that is broad question and I appreciate any comments!",

            "comment": "I came here to study in 2009 and (like many others) never left. I am now married and couldn't be happier. \n\nThat being said, the harsh reality of living here is that the lack of variety of things to do soon becomes apparent. Sure partying and socialising are great but the pubs are much the same and from what I hear, the student union on campus has gone downhill considerably, so going out becomes repetitive and your enjoyment will come down to the friends you make. A good way to make friends are the tons of societies, clubs and groups that would satisfy any interest. Not only the academic societies like Law/math/agriculture etc but also fun ones like the juggling society, LARPing and the ACOG (Aber community of Gamers) [Here] (https://www.abersu.co.uk/teamaber/societies/) is a list of the official societies but there are tons of others that you will see at the freshers fayre \n\nAs others have said the uni and town are very friendly and accepting, I have never heard of any form of hate crime going on whatsoever and the majority of people are happy to share a beer on the beach or a smoke outside a pub.\n\nThe area is quite hilly, and the university is located at the top of one of these hills, so if you move off-campus in your 2nd year you should be prepared to arrive at lectures red-faced and sweaty. There are, however, regular bus services and taxis are really cheap if you miss them or are in a rush.\n\nDepending on where in the US you are coming from, be prepared for a weather shock: whilst generally milder than many parts of the UK, the winter months can see weeks on end of overcast skies and intermittent rain with flooding of the surrounding areas fairly common. We don't get much snow here (relative to the rest of the UK) but even a couple of inches can cause travel disruptions and make getting up the hill to the uni a pain in the ass. However, in the summer the town transforms into a tourist haven and the sunsets are absolutely breathtaking even after more than 10 years here. Temperatures range from about 35F between December and February to around 70-80f in the summer.\n\nSomething else to consider is the cost of living here, if you intend on staying in uni accommodation (which Aber guarantees for the length of your study) then you should be fine, but if you move into private accommodation you will have to pay a considerable amount for the privilege, not to mention bills on top of that. splitting the cost of a place between your friends may seem tempting but living with friends is a bigger commitment than most people realise and should not be done without great consideration.\n\nOne thing that I heard from several Americans that came here is that they were not prepared for the amount of walking that we Brits take for granted, a 20-minute walk each way to get groceries is nothing, but as I said there are plenty of buses etc to get around that. There is also the amount we drink to consider, if you have fallen in with a decent group of people they will never pressure you to drink more than you are comfortable with, but be aware that you will see alcohol consumed in quantities that you thought would kill a human being.\n\nIn terms of the actual university, as u/Sparkly1982 said, your experience will differ greatly depending on what area of study you intend to pursue, but in general, everyone I've spoken to has said their tutors and lecturers were helpful, available and very knowledgeable. The university also has a wealth of resources available to help you if you need it, obviously I can't speak to other universities or what others have experienced, but when I suffered a mental health crisis they were more than happy to let me take a year out and re-asses my priorities and come back when I was ready to deal with that stress again. \n\nAll in all, you will love your time in Aberystwyth, it is a great place to study and make lifelong friends, but be wary of getting stuck here, the phrase \"end of the track syndrome\" comes to mind (Aber is the last stop on the rail service here, hence the term) and it is easy to feel trapped here because of it's rural setting, you have to travel at least 2hrs in any direction to get to any bigger form of civilization.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to message me if you have any more questions! And if you end up coming here, lets go for a pint",

            "comment": "Your mileage at the university will depend on what you're studying as each department has quite a different culture.\n\nHowever, the best way to describe the town and student body generally is as a party town. There are bars and cheap drinks galore and there's always a house party somewhere.\n\nOtherwise, the area is outstanding for natural beauty and the sunsets are the perfect backdrop to an autumnal beach bonfire.\n\nThe general attitude of the locals and student body is relaxed and socially liberal, though there are a few idiots about as with everywhere. Aber is mostly a haven for LGBTQ+ people and people of colour, but I do know a few who have had some issues (but they are the exception rather than the rule).\n\nIf there's anything specific you'd like to know, I've been here for 8 years now as a local and a student, so ask away.",

Not sure where you'll be staying but if it is in town then I'd advise on figuring out how long it takes to walk/bus etc. to your classrooms early on. If you're lucky in town you can catch starling murmurations, spot cool birds of prey (red kites) flying overhead and even seals and dolphins in the sea!",

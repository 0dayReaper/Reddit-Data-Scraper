The industrial year program is really good for getting some practical experience (and helping you find a job after graduation). The department has a big research focus on intelligent robotics, space/planetary robotics and computer vision and so if any of these interest you it's a very good choice as you'll not only have good taught modules on these topics, but will also have access to a lot of resources (like the robotics lab) for your dissertation project (my dissertation ended up being based around robotics and vision and I was able to develop it to run on the department's research robots)\n\nHope that helps :)",

The software engineer course has some compulsory modules in the later years, and you're required to do the industrial year, but you could equally pick the straight computer science degree and still do all the same modules on the software engineer course if you wanted. Main difference being you'd then end up with a BSc instead of a BEng, the BEng makes it a bit easier to become an accredited engineer with a professional body (but most software engineers don't both with this anyway)",

The department has good relationships with a lot of businesses that have taken on industrial year students in the past, so there's a wide selection that the university can help you with (and some come to visit the uni to pitch themselves to students), but you're also free to make your own arrangements if you'd like to. It also doesn't need to be anywhere near the university,  there's usually some within the university itself, in the science park and at the national library, but most people end up going further afield. I actually ended up doing my placement in Germany, with a company I found myself, but my second choice was the Plymouth Marine Lab, who regularly take students from Aber.\n\nIn your second year you'll get some interview training, CV advice, etc. to prepare you for applying. I don't know if it's still the same, but when I was there we had an away weekend to Gregynog Hall, which is a lovely old manor house the uni owns, where some employers would come to run mock interviews and try to help people figure out what sort of jobs they might find most interesting.\n\nFor the most part you're effectively just spending the year working a regular job. Both you and your employer need to write up a report at the end and you'll have some support from a member of the computer science department, but day to day you're just doing your job.",

Does seem interesting though.\n\nThe scholarship exams you suggested also seem worth a shot since the course is small. I am pretty middle of the road in computer science, getting a high 6 in my gcse so hoping that's enough to not embarrass myself, what did you get for the gcse? just so I can compare and see if I have a chance. And Luckily im year 12 at the moment so I have a lot of learning to do before I start but all of this seems like great advice :)\n\nThanks again! Great insight :)",

It's good that you're getting all this sorted so early!\n\nWe didn't actually have a computer science GCSE or A level as an option when I was at school (I think a handful of places had started offering it, but not many), closest we had was ICT (which was more about learning basic office skills than anything). I can't remember my GCSE results (they were fairly middling though) but my A level results were pretty awful overall, I had a C in ICT, a D in maths and an E in further maths, it's fortunate I did the scholarship exams, as I might not have made it in otherwise. I did the Aber exams in maths and computer science (I could already program a little bit from teaching myself), I'd recommend reading a bunch of past papers in whichever subjects you pick, as they can be really helpful.\n\nI didn't enjoy school that much, but I really took to university, as I could mostly just focus on things that interested me and spend time on odd little side projects that helped cement my understanding. I actually ended up staying at Aber for another 4 years after my degree to get a PhD, and thoroughly enjoyed that too.",

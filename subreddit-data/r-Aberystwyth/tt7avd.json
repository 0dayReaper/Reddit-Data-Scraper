    "postText": "Hi Aberystwyth!\n\nI need your help. I am a linguistics student from Aarhus University, Denmark and I am doing my master's thesis on the Welsh language. I am looking for people from, or from around, Aberystwyth who want to take part in a language experiment.\n\nIt is an experiment on Welsh English speakers' perception of the vowels in the words STRUT and TRAP. Apparently, the vowels sound quite similar when said by Welsh English speakers, so I am doing an experiment to see if they sound alike to Welsh English speakers as well!\n\nTo do this, I need some Welsh English speakers to listen to sound clips of \"Stack\" and \"Stuck\" and guess which of the two was played. (It's a lot harder than it sounds)\n\nIf you speak Welsh as your first or second language, you are welcome to try the experiment. If you don't speak Welsh at all, you're more than welcome as well!\n\nThe experiment takes around 10-15 minutes to complete, only requires that you can play audio, and all data collected is 100% anonymous and cannot be traced back to you in any way. The experiment is voluntary so unfortunately no compensation will be given.\n\nThe thesis works as a continuation of a line of other research done on Aberystwyth English by my supervisor. The sources for the major entries are cited below.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, you can do the experiment here: [https://webapp.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/WebExperiment/vowels\\_en.html](https://webapp.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/WebExperiment/vowels_en.html)\n\nThank you for your time - Sebastian, Aarhus University\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Hejn\u00e1, M. 2015.

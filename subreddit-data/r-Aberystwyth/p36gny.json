            "comment": "There aren't really any preferential areas of Aberystwyth  in my opinion, the Penparcau area is regarded by many as the \"rough\" part of Aber but this is nonsense. Anywhere you find a property that suits your needs will be a good area as there is a very low crimerate everywhere. \n\nBe aware that property prices in the area are almost double what they are in the neighbouring counties and be prepared to pay for the location rather than the actual property. \n\nI would also caution against bringing children here, there is so little for them to do. Very few after school clubs and activities, and if they are teenagers it's even worse. It is common to see groups of teens passing around a bottle of some kind and generally being a nuisance, but the police keep them from causing any real trouble. \n\nI know this hasn't really been helpful in terms of finding a property but these are points that most people don't consider when moving to this area and I hope it was helpful in some small way",

Playgrounds, the amusements, nature walks, CAT, the donkey farm, Silver Mountain Experience, Bwlch Nant Yr Arian, King Arthur's Maze, Ystwyth Bicycle Trail, dance class, stage class, ballet (all at the  Arts Centre), football clubs, Boy Scouts, Clarach beach in the summers, not to mention day trips to castles, amusement parks, and fun farms within a few hours drive in every direction (Folly Farm, Fun Farm in Llanrhystud, Quackers), Kids' films on all the time at the Commodore, Arts Centre and Libanus. Penparcau is nicer on one side of the main road than the other, yes, but it is still mostly families.",

A lot of the activities you have listed require your own transport to get to most of the time, of course public transport is an option but can sometimes can be inconvenient, and since we don't have a car of our own (we use her mum's car for pick ups and drop offs and day trips with the childminding kids) getting to these activities can be challenging. \n\nTo be fair I should have considered that if OP is looking to buy a house, they probably have their own transport. So, my apologies.\n\nI do stand by my sentiment that there is less to do with kids as they get older, as well as mentioning that the schools in the are not in the standing that they once were. Not to say they are bad, not at all, but they used to be excellent. And once they leave school, their career options are limited compared to what they would have access to nearer a city.\n\nAberystwyth is absolutely a fantastic place to raise a family, don't get me wrong I love it here, but that's not to say that there aren't issues that folk moving to the area should be made aware of that may affect their decision.",

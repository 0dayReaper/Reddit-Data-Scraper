I've also heard that the people here are a little too \"good.\" I appreciate the appeal of community service with PLP but I still want to experience parties here and there.

Parties at CNU are fine but don't expect any tailgates like a big sports school like Tech or anything. For academics I would say CNU does well but we have little name recognition which can be important for jobs. There's alot of people here that try to hype CNU up but I think they've all just drank the kool aid. I had a girl try to tell me CNU is on the same level as tech which is absolutely false. Overall it's a fine college but if you're looking for a party school or a diverse campus I'd look somewhere else.",

What major are you interested in? Your choice on college shouldn't be based solely on the social aspects, it should also be based on the academics and what program you're interested in.",

Weekend wise there are events sometimes and if you wanna go anywhere you have to drive nothing fun within walking distance. Except some restaurants are around but idk there isn\u2019t really much to say about it. I just go here because I live near and wanna get my degree and get out",

It\u2019s a good school w good people but you so need to drink the koolaid as another commenter said. Newport News is average, not much around the area but the rules that the school has are pretty crazy, 3 years on campus requirement, meaning you pay crazy money instead of moving off campus to a house or a apt. Ask me if you have a anymore questions",

            "comment": "CNU isn\u2019t a bad place to be imo. It is very academically oriented, but you can find fun things to do if you look for them. My experience with PLP has been ok. The only reason I\u2019m staying in it is for the money and priority course registration and housing. The classes required for PLP aren\u2019t really that bad. There aren\u2019t really any parties like you\u2019re probably imagining. And if there are you need to be on the list to get in, and from what I hear the alcohol is not free, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after. My experience at CNU has been positive so far, but I have already run into some really BS rules. CNU is also very \u201cimage driven\u201d, it looks really really nice, but it\u2019s not all that it\u2019s chalked up to be imo. I do enjoy it but the \u201cimage\u201d that CNU sells is very convincing. If you are looking for the classic college experience consisting of parties and lots of fun things to do all the time, CNU might not be the best choice. But if you want a very good education CNU does have that advantage.",

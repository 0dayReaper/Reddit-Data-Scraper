CNU seems to really be dominated by frat culture, and when I say that I don't mean to ruffle and feathers, it just seems to me that it attracts all these white people who just love to drink, smoke, and party. I don't like any of those things to be honest and the promises I got of CNU being a dry campus really is what drew me to the school in the first place. I want to be social, but I don't want to do so at college parties where I have to drink alcohol. Every time I go on the CNU class of 2020 Facebook page I just see people who are interested in drinking and frat culture/being preppy/being basic. Are there peopl who aren't like this at CNU? Am I just overreacting? Am I being a judgemental asshole? Honestly, I have no idea. All I wanted was a school where I could socialize and be my usual outgoing self, get an education, and network without being ostracized for not partying or for not wanting to do drugs or drink. Please help.",

                    "comment": "The phrase that rings the truest to me is \"you will find what you go looking for.\" I'm a third year student now and I've stayed pretty far away from the \"frat culture\" as you describe it. Despite that, I wouldn't say it's a dominating thing on campus. There's definitely no need to even go to parties, much less drink there if you want to be social, and that's not what everyone is about.\n\nYou will find that sort of atmosphere to varying degrees at any college, and I do believe personally that CNU has much less of a party culture in the way that you're talking about than other universities I have visited. It's not an invasive thing, and it doesn't at all have to be your thing.\n\nThe one other thing I would say is don't judge people based on what they post in the Facebook page (or on move-in day). Everyone who is attending as a freshman is going through a pretty major life change and is in the process of determining who they want to be, what they want to do with their lives, and what kind of people they want to surround themselves with. Some people will try and make huge changes and not be known as the same people they were in high school, and that's ok. Going to college is not easy. One of the great things about it, though, is that you don't have to be defined by what \"everyone else\" is doing - you can define your own place and experience, and people respect that.",

I don't have a speed test or the actual numbers, but it's way better than it [used to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/CNU/comments/1brkgt/speedtest/)  (IIRC it's something like 50 Mb/s down, someone correct me if I'm wrong). I've never had issues playing games or streaming video, and god knows half the dorm is watching netflix at any given time.\nOver the past year there's been some issues with the wifi reliability due to some changes they've been making, so I'm hoping that they'll have the summer to straighten those out, because it was generally pretty good before that.",

In the afternoon/evening until about 1am the internet slows down some. No specific numbers, but it was never so slow I couldn't steam video. WIFI can sometimes be unreliable, but most of the time it was okay. If you need to download something big, do it at like 4am. Downloaded an 8GB file at 4am in like 30 seconds.\n\nI don't know if they will continue, but they used to do a reboot on Friday nights that would cause everything to go down too.",

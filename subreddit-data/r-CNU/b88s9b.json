Im also considering two years at nvcc and going to VT. How is the Engineering and computer science department at CNU compared to a place like Tech and how are the opportunities here?",

            "comment": "The PCSE (physics, computer science, and engineering) department at CNU is excellent. The department is small enough to really get to know your professors and share in their research and passions, and broad enough to make sure you have what you need to enter the real world. They have close ties with NASA, Northorp Gruman, Jefferson Labs, and others for internships and jobs when you graduate. The 5 year masters program is also something to take into consideration. I can honestly say that I cannot think of a single person who graduated without a job or solid lead signed up. \nThe department is constantly evolving, and the electrical and computer engineering focuses have been vastly expanded since I graduated. The community is tight knit, and we are regularly in touch as both friends and a professional network. \nIf you have any questions feel free to send me a message. Good luck with your decision!",

The PCSE department hosts a PCSE focused career fair each year which brings in around 20 companies offering internships and full time positions. Many of these companies host on campus interviews within a week or so of the fair. \n\nAlso we have something called Pizza my Mind where every Thursday a company that is looking for PCSE majors to work for them come in and present in a lecture hall. Its a great way to see a wide array of companies in the area and around VA/DC which you can apply to.",

            "comment": "PCSE Department at CNU is a bit of a shitshow.  Individual classes are fine, but often don't make sense in context (teaching the same content in 3+ classes, not covering major concepts at all).  I would say you'd be much better off at Tech or VCU if you're interested in any kind of engineering, they have much more rigorous and well regarded programs.",

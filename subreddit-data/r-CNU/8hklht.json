I was wondering if people are right about there being like no drinking on campus bc that\u2019s honestly something I\u2019d like to do in college. Also, how bad is sharing a bathroom with 3 other people? And how is living on campus for 3 years? Is it fun?",

Just don't get caught.\n\nSharing a bathroom is fine as long as your roommates aren't too disgusting. If they are, don't be passive-aggressive about it. Be direct, but in a nice way if you can. \n\nI have to say, I enjoyed my time at the school but the 3-year forced living on campus is total bullshit. I mean, granted, they're really NICE dorms but they're essentially forcing you to pay the school's boarding fees and follow on-campus rules (like the dry campus thing) even though living off campus is way cheaper. But you'll be alright- and that senior year off campus really was great in the end. \n\nWelcome, new captain!",

            "comment": "I transferred in as a junior last year, so my experience is different than most people's, but I know that in the upperclassmen dorms, the explicit rule is no alcohol on campus, but the unspoken addendum is basically \"don't cause a disruption to other dorms and we won't investigate\". And the threshold for what is considered a disruption must be pretty lax, given my roommates last year got absolutely plastered, and played loud music while screaming at each other every weekend and our RA only entered our dorm for the once-per-semester apartment meetings.",

            "comment": "The bathroom situation is totally doable as long as you and your roommates communicate about cleaning and buying toilet paper. It has its drawbacks (definitely note where the bathroom is in your building just in case someone is showering and you need to go or something), but for the most part it works out in the end. \n\nAs for drinking, it is a little know fact but CNU is actually a dry residence hall not a dry campus. The difference is that CNU can have tailgates (that always involve alcohol) and serve alcohol at events in the Ferguson as a dry residence hall. If we were a dry campus (as everyone likes to say) we wouldn't be able to do those things. That aside, alcohol is always around in college regardless of rules, but be careful and smart about it of course. Also the consequences for getting caught in the res hall with alcohol is severe so you are better off just hitting up a tailgate or going to Port (the apartments where a lot of the upperclassmen live). Not trying to enable you or anything, but I know people will do it regardless and having a little advice may make you more informed. ",

            "comment": "I lived in Port Warwick this past year. Not too much of a party scene as it used to be but they can happen, walking distance from some dope ass Restaurants like brickhouse. It can get loud sometimes I will admit, depending if you get on a block with a frat house on it or just rowdy college kids (like me, we threw parties on occasion). Most of the time you\u2019ll get a quiet night or I was just lucky. Our neighbors we super awesome and chill. However management can be a pain in the ass. I didn\u2019t get my bed frame until a week after I lived there so I was sleeping on the ground, which wasn\u2019t a big deal, but they have a lot of problems with billing and a lot of hoops to jump through with the paperwork. Overall, the neighborhood is great, but management is not.",

A one bedroom and bathroom cost is $643/month. However you will have two roommates because it\u2019s townhouses only. If you go in with two friends the rent will be cheaper and be about $595/month. Those costs don\u2019t include electric",

Plus I could walk/longboard instead of driving which was a win. This was around 2012 so not sure if it\u2019s still in good shape or not.  It never got loud like port Warwick did",

I lived there and am here to tell the tale. \n\nOnly one murder while I lived there, in the parking lot of the units near the love shack (those ones as you roll up right facing the road) And like yours (maybe the same one?) it was premeditated- dude was found dead with his pants down :(. \n\nAs horrific as that was, I have never known NN murders to involve CNU students (might be wrong but none come to mind) &amp; I personally never felt unsafe living there (well once but it was unrelated to the apartment complex)\n\nIn fact, I would say I had a great experience living there! I had no bugs, and the unit I was tucked away off the road and had been renovated. Dishwasher, washer dryer, two bathrooms, man I was living the high life! Maintenance was always quick to help too and very chill. \n\nI did have to argue with the office after they tried to shyste me re: the carpet upon move out, but as soon as I provided them with the pictures I took of the apartment\u2019s carpets in fine condition they refunded my deposit. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had such a bad experience there! If I might ask when did you live there?",

I was so mad when they tried to say there was gum in our carpet (they had no photos - probably because it was a lie). I had covered every square inch of the carpet (even the stairs) in old oriental rugs the day we moved in so I know for a fact that carpet only saw the light of day once in the 2 years I lived there &amp; was *pristine* when we left.",

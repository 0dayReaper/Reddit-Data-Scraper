If you just want to take the class to get the requirement done then take 103/104, it will be a much easier time overall. Only take 121 if you are able to put a good bit of time and effort into the class or your grade will suffer.",

Just make sure you look at the LLCC (liberal learning core curriculum) because 103/104 might not be on the list. You have to take 12 credits from natural sciences I believe I definitely know 121/122 qualify ",

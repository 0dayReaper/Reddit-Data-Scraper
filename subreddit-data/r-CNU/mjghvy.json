    "postText": "So I\u2019m a rising sophomore and going through the housing process.  I was assigned the time of 1:55 pm today to sign up for my housing assignment.  So I dutifully go about my day, and at 1:55 I go into the housing portal only to receive a message that says: \u201cWe are currently out of housing assignments for the 2021-22 academic year.  Please send your info to the housing admin office for consideration for the waitlist.\u201d  I\u2019m sorry, what?  This is completely ridiculous.  What happened to all freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, huh?  Just because I wasn\u2019t in student government and didn\u2019t have a 4.0 gpa in high school shouldn\u2019t mean that I suddenly get to miss out on housing, especially when my family and I have put down so much money on this school only to get relatively disappointing dining options and now, terrible housing transition services.  Is it that hard to treat your students as more than potential moneymakers?  As someone who put personal capital into this school, I am very displeased with the less than satisfactory return on my investment.  Can anyone tell me what my options are for housing, or if this is just a temporary situation?  I don\u2019t get why I have to potentially live off campus now just because my time slot was later than everyone else\u2019s.",

            "comment": "Yeah like the other comment, you really haven\u2019t provided enough information about your situation. Did you not have roommates selected? You have to do requests and everyone has to have everyone selected. If you didn\u2019t you will be randomly placed. Housing is guaranteed due to the 3 year housing requirement (unless you are local and apply towards the housing exemption).",

            "comment": "Did you have a housing group? First of all, if you were trying to get a room all by yourself, that isn\u2019t how it works. You have to have a group of 4-5-6 to actually secure housing. You didn\u2019t mention it above, so I\u2019m bringing it up. If out of the whole group you really were the earliest time, you did in fact get fucked by housing, but will eventually get placed in SOME room. Housing lottery is in fact bullshit, and it screwed over my suite last year, but we were able to secure a poso room. Housing is guaranteed so you\u2019ll be placed, but maybe not the selected roommates. If you were trying to sign up by yourself, you would have screwed yourself over regardless. Sorry to hear about the predicament, and I wish they did it better but there isn\u2019t anything us students can do to change the system.",

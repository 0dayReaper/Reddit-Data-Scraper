You have a decent to good chance, but make sure you are very prepared and professional for your interview and do well next year first semester (unless you are a senior, in which case you\u2019re a little late there bud). Any more questions, feel free to ask",

At CNU the two most popular majors right now are psychology and biology. The question really isn\u2019t what the best major for the school is though, its what major is best for you. If you spend four years studying something you hate, then you\u2019ve effectively wasted those four years and every second you spend pursuing that field afterwards. Do what makes you happy, and if theres not money there, so something you at least find interesting. What do you find interesting/want to study?",

I graduated in 2010 before the economy had recovered from the last recession, and most of the people I knew in CS/CE had jobs lined up before they graduated while a lot of my friends in other fields were struggling.\n\nI've said this before on this sub, but consider starting out in Computer Engineering because it's easier to switch from CE to CS if you change your mind later than the other way around. You'd need to check the course catalog to be sure on that, but I've looked at it within the last couple of years and not much had changed from when I was there.",

Luter business school is really highly ranked, so thats also good. For comp sci you might want to be interested in Mason. With the proximity to DC, you will have lots more cs related opportunities. I know someone who got 18/hr as an internship to basically pretend to write code all fay and get people coffee. But on the other hand, a lot of the cnu staff for comp sci (one of my majors) seem to really care about their students and how well they do.",

If you are worried your SAT is too low (which it's not) you could always apply \"test optional.\" My wife did that and got in because her GPA was excellent but her SAT was not great. For you though, it seems like you'll do fine getting in. JUst don't let your GPA fall senior year. They don't really care about APs or honors high school classes. Just GPA, SAT, and volunteering",

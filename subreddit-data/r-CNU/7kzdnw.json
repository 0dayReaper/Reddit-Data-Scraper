    "postText": "I just accepted a job at CNU.  My chair had mentioned faculty get \"dockable laptops.\" My question is: what kind of laptops are these?  Anyone know the hardware specs?  \n\nI've been considering buying a new laptop; but if my faculty laptop is decent, I may not. \n\nI don't start for almost nine months so I won't see it myself for a while and I've already asked the chair a million questions, so I don't want to pester her with my dumb tech fixations.

I wouldn't say they are great computers and you probably couldn't do anything like gaming or video editing but it's a fine computer for browsing the web or teaching. I've never seen a professor have a problem. ",

And it was a few years ago, but I remember asking a new professor at that time what his provided computer situation was like, and he said they gave him the choice of either a top end MacBook or a very solid windows laptop. I really cant remember the specifics, and this was maybe 3/4 years ago so it may have changed. Congrats again, though",

    "postText": "Hello, my name is Shane. I'm a transfer student coming from Germanna and am transferring to CNU come this fall. I applied for on campus housing and have been put on a wait-list for it. Does anyone know how limited the housing for transfer students is? Should I seriously consider looking at apartments instead in the area? Is the housing first come first serve for transfers? Any information would be appreciated, thank you.",

            "comment": "Hey Shane, I also got into CNU as a transfer for fall 2022. I haven\u2019t accepted their offer yet since I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll go there if I get in somewhere else, but from what I\u2019ve read on their housing page sophomores can\u2019t live in freshman dorms (obviously) and they can\u2019t live in the apartments that are intended for only juniors and seniors, so there are just a few halls you would be allowed to live in (if you\u2019re going to be a sophomore in the fall too). But unfortunately transfers get last pick of the dorms so after everyone else has chosen their rooms, if there\u2019s any room left you may get to be in dorm but you\u2019re not guaranteed on-campus housing. Hope that helped and I hope you\u2019re able to get into an on-campus room.",

            "comment": "Honestly, look at apartments.\n\nCNU already has the tendency to allow more students to live on campus than what they can actually accommodate (making rooms a triple that don't really have the space to be a triple), and if you're on the wait-list, that's them  essentially saying you don't have a spot on campus.\n\nWith that in mind, avoid The Suites at Port Warwick. It's a popular apartment complex for CNU students to go to, but the management is absolutely shitty, won't take any of your maintenance requests seriously, and will absolutely try to blame any and all damage on you.",

I unfortunately fell into the trap that is Port, so that's the only apartment complex I lived in while I lived in Newport News.\n\nI know many students who lived off campus and didn't live in Port tended to rent in the houses in the neighborhood surrounding CNU campus.\n\nI would recommend joining the Facebook group for your year, and if your year isn't senior, to join the Facebook group for what will be the upcoming senior class (Class of 2023).",

            "comment": "So this is really a tossup. Im a transfer that enrolled in fall 2021 as a sophomore. I didn't submit my transfer app till June but they managed to house me in a sophomore dorm. It's important to note that housing isn't based on credit hours it's based on age and number of years in campus, so enrolling as a student age 20 would you put in the sophomore pool while enrolling at age 21 puts you in the junior or senior pool (I don't have a source for this but I'm looking for one. I do know that when I called the housing office in July I was asked for my age). if you're enrolling as a junior there isn't junior housing left available at this point. For the class of 2024 that enrolled as freshmen that means they'll be placed in lower class dorms, and they won't start looking at housing already enrolled transfers until their commitments to their freshman housing guarantee policy is met. It's possible they will find more upperclass housing by i.e. overcrowding rooms but that space will mostly be given to returning students. I'm not sure how they weigh housing already enrolled transfers vs incoming transfers but I'd imagine returning ones are higher on the waitlist. \n\nThis all sounds grim but there are some upsides: Im told that the housing office is more lenient with requests of room changes since the class of 2024 is a bit smaller (presumably due to covid) and they have more empty spaces on campus than they have in previous years. That's good news if you're in the class of 2024, and if you're not the it's possible the 2025 class is also smaller (i know of at least one freshman who is transferring out so you've got that available!). Housing for transfers is first come first serve but I submitted my app in like the middle of June which is closer to the end of the housing process and they managed to find me a space. Because you've submitted yours earlier than that you'll probably get a better spot on the waitlist than I did, and you very well could get housing.",

            "comment": "&gt; Christopher Newport University is in the middle of its largest wave of COVID-19 cases this school year, a little over two weeks after in-person classes started.\n\n&gt; As of Wednesday, 129 students and six employees had active cases. On average, 171 students were in quarantine each day last week, about 3.5% of the student body.\n\n&gt; In a letter to students and employees Monday, vice president for student affairs Kevin Hughes blamed the rising numbers on students not following safety protocols, not in-person classes.",

But like you, I don't get that because those people were still near each other in the school.",

            "comment": "My friends and I in university chorale spent a whole class period discussing this.  It\u2019s more than likely the dining halls, since those are the most congested places on campus and there are reportedly workers there not wearing masks.  I don\u2019t get why they close the pop up cafes on weekends and then bitch and moan about \u201cstudents not following the regulations\u201d when we\u2019re basically forced to either shell out dining dollars or actual money to buy food off campus or go to the dining halls and risk covid.  I\u2019ve spent many a night with an empty stomach because, as a double music major who doesn\u2019t own a piano at home, I basically have to be here to learn at all, and I\u2019m not trying to get covid because I was hungry and forced myself to go risk getting a case just to eat their shitty frozen food.  The university ultimately doesn\u2019t get or refuses to admit that most of these kids don\u2019t need to be here to learn.  History, English, math, and business majors can complete basically all their educational material coverage online, without having to be in person, since almost all the work is traditionally academic.  Really, what should have happened is they selected certain groups to come back by major based on facility needs.  For example, people who take science labs should\u2019ve had a much higher priority than people who are in group lectures for a history course.  It\u2019s not a bias because I\u2019m a music major, it\u2019s just practicality: during these trying times, CNU academic facilities should be used by students on a basis of extreme need, not on a basis of \u201chow many can we let in without a spike in cases\u201d.",

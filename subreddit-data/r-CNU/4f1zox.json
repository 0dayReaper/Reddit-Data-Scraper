Public transit isn't great in the region unfortunately. Parking is pricey, but college is expensive in general so it's a cost that is well worth it.",

For just going to the store etc., you can probably catch rides with friends but if you want to go off campus often for a job or volunteering or something it is good to have your own.\n\nYou can find info on parking at CNU's website, along with pretty much all other info you may need.\n\nhttp://cnu.edu/parking/parking/index.asp#Purchase",

If so I would also guess it isn't very robust or reliable an implementation of the service. \n\nThis school isn't a microcosm the way a VT, ODU, or other big state school is. You will want the ability to drive around. This is a cool area and worth exploring on your own. It is easy to drive around here and there are a lot of places to go off campus to eat and have fun. I say go for it. Parking in general is fine. My parking pass was $250 I believe. ",

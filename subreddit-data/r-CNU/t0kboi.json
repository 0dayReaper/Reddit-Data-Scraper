The criminology department was bad when I left, but showed signs of improvement. There is catholic service on campus and plenty of religious clubs, but I wouldn't call CNU over-religious in the least. Much like partying, if you didn't want to see it, you wouldn't, but if you wanted it, it was easy to find. There were some LGBTQ clubs on campus and I roomed in James River in a suite with a trans man and a trans woman. I'd say it's queer friendly.  \n\n\nHave your daughter check out the Knights of the Force! I founded that club back in 2015.",

Of course, there is going to be people who are full of hatred in any large enough group, but it is plenty easy to find your people and to not have to worry about the others. I\u2019ve personally had a great experience academically, and it largely depends on what her major will be, but there are plenty of opportunities. I read the comment about the LGBTQ community being elitist, and I understand what they meant, but I do believe that the tone has shifted in the last three years. I think a large part of that may have stemmed from them being less accepted and thus having to push that aspect of them much more. Now, there is very little disagreement on campus about the LGBTQ community and a majority are very accepting (except for that one scholar in residence who is not coming back next year). If you or your daughter have any more questions about the school please feel free to reply or DM me. I\u2019m happy to be honest about it, but I also recognize that there are some things people complain about regarding CNU that are either their faults or just part of the college experience",

You can go from one side to the other in about 15 minutes. \n\nI would have wished that administration in general wasn't so hard to slog through if you have any problems. It's a pain in the ass.\n\nIt's not necessarily an overly religious vibe, but there is one. There are about a million and one different religion-based student groups on campus, but they aren't in your face about it.\n\nI personally didn't like the LGBTQ community there. (I'm a bisexual woman, for reference). A lot of the community has this very elitist bug up their ass that can be very off-putting, especially if you aren't \"loud and proud\" about it. This could have changed however in the 3 years since I've graduated.",

            "comment": "This showed up on my feed but I visit CNU almost every weekend because I have a lot of friends there. (I go to ODU further down in Norfolk) what I\u2019ve experienced there is that small school energy where everyone knows each other. It\u2019s a good school for academics, but most small schools are able to stand out like that due to size. Less diversity than ODU &amp; William and Mary in my opinion. There\u2019s not much to do in Newport News, and anything outside the CNU area is a little dangerous if you have no common sense. I think another downside is that they don\u2019t offer a huge selection of graduate programs, but other than that it\u2019s got a nice campus. You are also required to live on campus dorms until your senior year. I don\u2019t know how the lgbt community is like but the place seems to be in a generally more conservative area.",

The area itself is alright, not the best lol. The campus could look a lot better but the buildings on the inside are pretty. If you\u2019re visiting make sure you check out areas like Ghent (hipster urban place outside downtown) in Norfolk and Downtown. I\u2019m not originally from down here and didn\u2019t know Norfolk was actual city with tall buildings. ODU prides itself off diversity and is good for engineering/ other STEM majors. Downsides are the Hampton roads tunnel traffic and it floods more. I know the LGBT community is larger here and Norfolk is considered one of the friendly cities in this state",

But I personally had a horrible experience with admissions treating me like a number and trying to pad their statistics with me... It just makes you think if they treat people like that during admissions, it can't be better after you give them money, sign papers, move, and basically get stuck there.... I've also heard a lot of similar stories about them from other people. So administrators are definitely not quality individuals and the university definitely doesnt deserve any money or fodder in my opinion.... but their students and professors might be a saving \"grace\". \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

It's a professional designation that allows individuals to verify financial statements and prepare tax returns (among other things). In Virginia, [it requires 150 credit hours of education](https://boa.virginia.gov/cpa-exam/requirements/). Usually, people just get a bachelors (120 hours) and a Masters in Accounting (MAcc) that's 30 hours. But it's cheaper to just do all 150 in undergrad if you plan ahead.",

            "comment": "If you figure our the mac address of your smart tv (xbox, play station, anything else not a standard computer you need to plug in...) and  spoof it with your PC while registering (and doing all the dumb security checks).  Then when you plug in your smart tv network will \"recognize\" your smart tv as safe and allow you to connect.  Otherwise you'll get an error.\n\n\nThats how we did it when i was going to CNU.  Apparently now the wifi situation improved beyond what it was in 2009 (only accessible in the lounges).  So you might be able to just connect to the wireless and be done.\n\nHope that helps!",

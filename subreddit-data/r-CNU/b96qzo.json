With the few math classes you are required to take you should be able to get through the classes with minimal issues. If the classes are difficult and you are struggling CNU has plenty of places to get help (free tutoring, office hours, other professors, etc). Also you should see if you have already gotten credit for some of the math classes you may have to take from your transfer in.\n\nGood luck.",

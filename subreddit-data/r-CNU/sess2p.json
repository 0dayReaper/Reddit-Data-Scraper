Just wondering how supportive the environment is in terms of helping students stay on track.\n\nThanks!",

If your grades drop below a certain point you'll be put on academic probation and have to do some stuff with the CAS (btw they're awesome you should go there if you need help getting shit together academically)\n\nAnyways my point basically is, if you need help you should ask for it and don't count on anyone coming to help you of their own good will. Sadly, that is often not how things work in the real world. CNU does have some good places to support you if you seek them out, but the ball is in your court as they say",

Most professors are pretty consistent with it and always happy to give one on one help during that time. If you're looking to ask general questions about the school either as a prospective student or freshman, the class Facebook pages are way more active and people are pretty willing to answer questions.",

            "comment": "Current RA here, there are support networks on campus for both students, professors, and family members to reach out about the well-being on an individual, and generally it comes to us RA\u2019s to go and meet up with that individual to see how they are doing. This includes grades wise, socially, and emotionally. Not everything going on gets brought in front of me, but as far as classes professors will report when grades start to slip and that would reach me. It can also sometimes be a case of the individual not desiring to change and give their classes the effort they require. \n\nGiven that you\u2019re a potential parent, I\u2019ll be as honest as I can be about our system. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it is significantly better than what other schools have assuming your child would be living in the dorms. The best course of action would be to have an open dialogue with your child and talk about their in-class performance on a regular basis. Legally, your child does not have to disclose the information about their grades to you, so there is no true way to find out if they are not open to sharing. This rule applies at any school afaik as your child would be considered a legal adult. If they had good habits keeping you in the loop in high school, I would just encourage that as they move forward into college.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got any other questions you want to bounce off me I\u2019d be more than happy to either answer them outright or point you in the right direction. :)",

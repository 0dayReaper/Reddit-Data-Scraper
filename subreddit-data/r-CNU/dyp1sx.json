There isn't really any way people are introduced to this sub except \"oh, I use Reddit, I wonder if CNU has a subreddit\"\n\nseems like there are a bunch of people that will jump in on conversations if they see a thread, but not a ton that will start a new one. I think that's true for reddit in general",

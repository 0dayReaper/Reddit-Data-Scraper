Would it be better to get more people to have a better chance?\n\nWhat are the big differences between the Apartments and the Residence Halls? Which apartments should we try to get into? Village, or east campus? How different is Rappahannock from the actual apartments?\n\nOur main want is to have individual bedrooms and not too far from the Academic Buildings.",

            "comment": "Getting a 2 bedroom might be difficult, so you should have a backup plan. I lived on east and had friends in Rap. Rap is more expensive, but it's a 12 month lease and is a little bit nicer( hardwood floor kitchen). I would say go for east since it's cheaper and the base floorplan is the same",

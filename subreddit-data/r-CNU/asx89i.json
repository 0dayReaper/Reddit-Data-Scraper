There\u2019s nothing like some continuity in your life and CNU excels at all of those things. \n\nPLP students get special treatment in almost everything. It sucks ass if you\u2019re not in it. \n\nCommons is the better dining hall. \n\nIt is so freaking easy to make friends here at CNU, you\u2019re gonna have a great time,  just be chill and talk to people.

Not communicating enough, especially to professors I had trouble with, was my one major flaw as a student. Talking to some professors changed my view of them considerably. Not to defend the truly bad ones, but a lot of professors are just as awkward as you are as a student, and just as wary, defensive, and frustrated with life. They are keenly aware of the difference between students who are just there to get it over with, and those who really want to learn. Give them a chance to prove that. If you avoid them because you don't like them, you can't possibly expect the situation to change. Number one thing I wish I'd known from the start, more than anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParticipate in your education. What I mean by this is don't be afraid to bend and shape it into what you want or need. For example, another mistake I made was not protesting the heavy liberal arts requirement typical of honors degrees in the USA. I was required to take classes I had no need for, and they prevented me from taking classes I needed very much. This affects me to this day, even professionally. I learned a bit too late that they can be flexible but only if you speak up. Tell your department advisor or chair that you are unhappy with it, and demonstrate to them what you are missing because of it. You are paying for this degree, thus you have every right to influence it yourself. Also, don't be afraid to tell a professor or advisor when you feel like a class is not good enough, or was missing something you needed. It might not get fixed right away, but you may find them willing to help you learn what you need outside of class. These kinds of conversations can also lead to a lot of interesting things, including off-campus work, references, and long-term friendships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome degree programs require a \"senior project\" even if you are only going for your Bachelors. I would suggest you do one anyway, and make sure your advisor or a professor know about it. Ask to present or at least publish your work where others can see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo sailing. CNU is located by the best rivers and bay in the world for it, and you can do it just about all year long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, no matter how hard you are studying, remember now and then it's OK to sneak into the physics lab and use the projection display to watch Dirty Harry movies.",

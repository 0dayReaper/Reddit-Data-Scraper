    "postText": "Anyone at CNU play Ultimate Frisbee? I'm in a Sunday morning league that is looking for more teams/players. The games start on 9/11 at 11 AM in Hampton. The league is co-ed and pretty laid back. The deadline to join is this week. \n\nYou must be 21 or older to play, sorry freshmen! But this is a good way to get active and meet people off campus. \n\nFor more info, the wbesite is kickball.com/vapeninsulaultimate",

    "postText": "So I'm a returning student, about to start my junior year. I know a bit more about technology than most people and I'm looking to achieve an open NAT type (for Rainbow 6 Siege), and just generally have more ability to change options and do things my own way. Would using my own router (against rules I know) achieve this? And furthermore, would they be able to figure out I was doing it without finding the router (set up as hidden network of course)",

            "comment": "Sadly the simple answer is that this will not work. The NAT configuration would only work if your router was connected directly to the Internet. At CNU, your router is connected through CNUs NAT which you have no control over. I'm not an expert at Networking, but this is more or less correct. I don't think you will be able to use your game the same way you did at home.\n\nAs for of they could find you, the simple answer is yes. A hidden network only stops the people who know nothing about networking. Also CNU can find your router through its ethernet connection and track it down to the ethernet jack it's plugged in to. ",

Never got in trouble, I always threw a shirt over it or something for room checks but they honestly do not care enough to go search for it. Having said that, the only reason I used my router was because I was able to change the NAT settings and finally play some games on an open connection....not sure if anything has changed in the 2 years since I graduated but it should be doable ",

I actually already have a paid VPN subscription so I'm probably going to try that first, but if that doesn't do it I'll try the one you linked to.  \n  \nIf you meant siege for the servers there is a file where you can tell it which server to connect to, I already have mine set to east coast (connected me to Brazil for some reason...).",

NAT type probably shows as strict, which causes issues for siege in particular more than most games.  \n  \nI'm asking this question in an attempt to solve that exact problem. Could be NAT type (port forwarding issue), which CNU will not help you with, or just high network latency which an ethernet cable could fix. If it's a NAT type issue, I wanted to know if I could possibly have my own hidden router and if that would allow me to have open NAT.  \n  \nBest of luck to you and your roommate, let me know if you figure anything out. Hoping I don't have to stop playing siege just because of our internet! ",

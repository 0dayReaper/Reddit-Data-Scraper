    "postText": "So I haven\u2019t even been admitted yet to CNU, but I already know that the major I have selected is not what I want to study. I selected Cybersecurity, but I want to switch into business. I\u2019ve heard that you get paired for housing with people from your majors and I don\u2019t want to be with physics and engineering majors if I am doing business. What should I do? Can I call someone or is it too late. Decisions come out March 15th.",

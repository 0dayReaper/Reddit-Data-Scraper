I really don\u2019t want to end up in PoNo as a sophomore. Does anyone know anything about this? ",

            "comment": "I'm gonna be a junior next year so I'll say what I know. The housing lottery was really fucked this year for a lot of us, and a substantial portion of my class does not have living space at the moment. That being said, I'm a current resident of Warwick and did manage to find housing in Rappahannock, meaning that I will be moving out along with the rest of my suite. I'm not the only one in this situation, I know a fair amount of people in Warwick that will be leaving, so I think there will definitely space available for rising sophomores. I doubt you will live in PoNo next year, but the issue is how much space is there for second years if they are going to allow my class to continue living here. That I sadly do not have any information on, but if you have an earlier housing lottery time then you'll probably end up in Warwick or PoSo.  ",

They are literally warwick without the kitchens. And if anything that makes them nicer because every time I went in Warwick to visit friends I wanted to throw up because of the smell of burnt foods lingering in the hall way. ",

PoNo as a sophomore is still nice, you still get a commonroom, and you're still close to academic buildings. Only difference is you don't have the hall kitchens like you do in Warwick, or the personal kitchen if you get lucky in JR. I wouldn't worry too much, wherever you end up, as long as you're living with people you like, should still be fun",

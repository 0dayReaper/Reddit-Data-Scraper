He never rolled up to the office unannounced, never in our staff meetings, and no regular email correspondence. \n\nWays he influenced the program were from a bigger picture perspective. Speakers is where he has a very heavy hand, though. He picked almost every single person for the speaker series. That was almost totally out of our hands, which was frustrating because we knew that was the least liked part of PLP. Students got notification of speakers almost immediately after we did. I\u2019d estimate that there were only 3ish speakers during my time there that were secured more than a few weeks in advance. There was also one speaker he was really frustrated about seating - not enough students near the front, people lingering in the atrium, students coming in late. We had to revamp how we did check-in and put PLP staff in the concert hall to act as ushers. \n\nHe made decisions on the number of students admitted which I think is what changed the nature of the program through it\u2019s 20 year history. The first PLP class was a cohort of about 20 students. For Leadership Adventure they did a weekend long camping trip. I know there was whitewater rafting involved and other outdoor adventure elements. So, there\u2019s a history on why it\u2019s \u201cLeadership ADVENTURE,\u201d y\u2019know? Fundamentally, PLP is a recruiting tool. In order to grow the university into what it is today, PLP numbers had to increase. \n\nHonestly, outside of those pieces, he left us to do our thing. He used to have more involvement with PLP in its earlier years, but the as PLP, CNU, and the number of professional staff dedicated to the program grew, his day-to-day involvement decreased.",

Have 2 or 3 stories to tell about a time you\u2019ve seen leadership happen in your life. Talk about things in your wheelhouse instead of talking about grandiose ideas that aren\u2019t relatable to you. PLP is built in the idea that leadership is accessible to everyone regardless of position, age, or traits. \n\nMy second piece of advice is to be authentic. You can tell when someone is BSing you just to try to impress you.",

About 400 students are admitted to the entering class. The vast majority of PLP students get $1,000 or $2,000 a year. I\u2019d estimate about 50 get $5,000, but you\u2019re usually also Honors eligible. There\u2019s a lucky dozen or so students who receive a $10,000 a year scholarship. Currently, only two students at CNU have full rides and they\u2019re Juniors. Those full ride spots won\u2019t be available until after they graduate. \n\nI\u2019ve written my fair share of letters of recommendation in support for scholarships, internships, and graduate school. You have to put in the effort to cultivate the relationship with your staff guide for those to be more than half-hearted and vague. PLP helps students stand out when resumes are being reviewed, but if you don\u2019t have anything substantive to talk about in the interview it\u2019s fluff. Doing the minimum isn\u2019t going to make you special. I think that goes for just about anything on your resume, though.",

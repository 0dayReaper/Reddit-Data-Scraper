Have a roomie meeting and come up with rules ya\u2019ll want to establish about quiet times, guests, cleanliness, and item sharing. \n3. Try to be out of your room as much as possible. Utilize your lounge when you can. Walk around lake Maury. Toke up behind the bushes in front of the huge bronze statue of Captain Chris. Use the library.",

Instead of letting things build up have a civil and respectful conversation with them about the issue is bothering you and work something out. You\u2019ll also have to make a roommate agreement, facilitated by your RA. They\u2019re a great resource. Open up the conversation there or ask them for advice!",

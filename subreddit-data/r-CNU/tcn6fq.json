    "postText": "I have never seen a bar let so many underage kids drink, and I guess it got the best of them last night. It was not even 12am and ambulances pulled up outside because a girl passed out on the sidewalk. Cops everywhere and the whole thing got shut down.\n\nThis bar basically confirms my opinion that this area needs a bigger college bar scene. CNU students are flocking to this new location because there are literally no other options. Good Vibes is capitalizing on this with overpriced drinks and honestly suss vibes from management.\n\nThe venue and acoustics are honestly top tier, but they clearly have never experienced what it is like to be a \"college bar\" which I fear will get the best of them!",

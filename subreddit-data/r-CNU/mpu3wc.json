    "postText": " \n\nHi everyone! My name is Damian and I'm an engineering student at UC Irvine. I'm creating a club called The Futurist Society and I'm trying to expand it to other campuses.\n\nIn this club we'll discuss future technologies like flying cars and reusable rockets, and form a network of students excited for the future! The pandemic is a rough time to do club stuff, so we'll also be prepping a lot for next year!\n\nFor now we'll all just be on one Discord, but once we get some momentum going we can create chapters for each school. If technology and futurism interest you, come check us out!\n\n[https://discord.gg/grwFWJ3RFX](https://discord.gg/grwFWJ3RFX)",

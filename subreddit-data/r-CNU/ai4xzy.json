    "postText": "I\u2019m considering attending CNU and I wanted to know what current students and alumni think of it. I\u2019ve heard that many people don\u2019t like it because of the \u201cpreppy-ness\u201d of some of the people there. I\u2019ve had over night trips there and I really enjoyed it, but I\u2019m having a hard time choosing between CNU and VT. \n\nEdit: So as of right now I\u2019m also being considered to be recruited for their track team. I really want to run in college, but the only way that\u2019d happen is if I go to CNU. But I definitely be scheduling a tour for VT to see it because I really love CNU\u2019s campus. ",

            "comment": "Depends on what you are like. You need to choose what school you feel like you identify with. I went to CNU because i preferred a small school. I'd always see friends walking to or from class and felt like I was part of a community. CNU is great if you are active outside of the classroom and get involved with clubs, intramural sports, greek life, etc. \n\nI loved my time there but it really depends if you want a small school or big school experience. Also depends on what you want to major in/what career you want to pursue.",

Between VT and CNU the edge would have to be with VT. CNU is in a decent location for engineers with jefferson lab and the norfolk naval base being so close.",

I will say that we really don't have a strong preppy population. \n\nThere are a few comments that aren't exactly accurate, from my perspective.\n\n\\- I have a few friends in neuroscience at CNU, and they've gotten some really cool research opportunities. I've never heard them complain about their department or any lack of opportunities. That's what's really cool about smaller universities - there's far less competition for research projects in the area.\n\n\\- The dorms are insanely good at CNU, all four years. As an upperclassmen, you get your own fairly sized room and bathroom. \n\n\\- The classes are not too easy, as one poster said. I'm not sure what department that person is in, but in my experience and the experiences of my friends, very few classes are easy A's.\n\n\\-  We have a lot of nationally renowned professors here. Most of them don't brag on themselves, but you'd be surprised.\n\n\\- The lack of classes available problem varies wildly from major to major. ",

Cnu was good, but I was often disappointed by the lack of courses available. It was more of a linear progression and less of a choose your interest",

Not saying one is better than the other, just that CNU has had a few years to establish a curriculum. You can compare the course catalogs for [VT](https://neuroscience.vt.edu/undergraduate/courses-offering-SoN.html) and [CNU](http://cnu.edu/academics/areasofstudy/bs-neuroscience/).\n\nThe opportunities for meaningful student research as an undergrad are also good at CNU. I had a great undergraduate research experience starting my freshman year.\n\nYou'll be fine wherever you go. I'd recommend choosing based of the campus vibe that fits you better. ",

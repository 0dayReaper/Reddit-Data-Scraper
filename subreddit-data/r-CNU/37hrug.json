    "postText": "Hey /r/CNU!\n\nHope everyone is having a great summer / summer classes. I've been working on a cool new system for looking up, planning, and scheduling courses. Since working on the RateMyProfessor Chrome plugin I've been wanting to overhaul the course system at CNU to make it easier to use.\n\nYou can check out the project here: http://opencourseproject.com\n\nOpen Course integrates all of the aspects of courses so that you can look through classes by any criteria. You can build schedules for upcoming terms, view your exam periods, find other facebook friends in your classes, see RateMyProfessor scores for the class, and even follow a course so that you get emails about its status as you wait for registration. \n\nIf you want to share your schedule you can get a viewable link to send to your friends. For example, here's my schedule for last semester: http://opencourseproject.com/schedule/4acd6dec31dd112/\n\nAs usual with my projects, reddit is the first to get into the loop because y'all are really helpful with feedback, beta testing, and suggestions. So please let me know if you like what you see, have a cool idea, or anything else that crosses your mind. Also feel free to build up your schedules - I'm at a point in development where everything should be set and no data will change from here on out.\n\nIf you want to see some examples of what you can do, check these! http://imgur.com/a/EN8ib",

Perhaps the overall design being more CNU, without any copyright infringement of course. \n\nOther than that, if you can get a strong base of support, you probably could eventually present it to Kevin Hughes, Dean of Students. What's the worst that could happen??",

There's lots of small changes I wanted to make to the existing system so that's why I ended up just making a new one, haha.\n\nThat's definitely a thought. The current system isn't bad by any means but we are living in a new generation where having open information is a requirement. Having a clean-looking, open-ended, and more logical way to go about organizing your life is really cool.",

If you have your course schedule you got at Setting Sail you should be able to still put in the CRNs and add your schedule that way.\n\nFreshman input on usability is really important to me since you guys are the ones who have the freshest outlook on the whole system, so definitely let me know if you have any cool ideas or are confused with something.",

You might be able to get housing in the freshman dorms, but I would call the Housing Office and get the information straight from the source. They might have a certain amount of rooms saved for transfers. That being said, if you did get housing it probably wouldn\u2019t be very good. ",

I highly recommend taking advantage of the fact you're not forced to live on campus and find some other housing, like port Warwick. There's also some other affordable places nearby on Warwick. ",

Definitely call and see what is possible, and look into getting an apartment near campus. You can get a nice appt for around 900/mo around campus and the drive is super easy from anywhere. ",

    "postText": "Heyo,\n\nJust wondering if it's possible to live off campus as a junior. I was going to consider getting an apartment over the summer and living down here, but I'm not sure if that'll meet any requirement to allow me to become a commuter student. The main reason I am trying to become a commuter student is because of financial reasons.\n\nThanks for any help.",

My friend junior year just didn\u2019t fill out the housing contract and they didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to let them live off campus. However, that\u2019s a risk and they have been catching on to that and taking way your ability to register. So it\u2019s a dice roll, if they think you were just dumb and forgot to do it then you\u2019ll be fine, but if they think you\u2019re trying to cheat the system you\u2019ll be living on campus and registering late. Your choice. If you establish permanent residence though like with proof of rent or mortgage then they have to let you live off campus. You should call and ask before risking it though",

If you have a special reason why you need to live off campus (medical, personal, family, religious, etc.) Maybe you could try to contact the proper department and ask for special consideration.",

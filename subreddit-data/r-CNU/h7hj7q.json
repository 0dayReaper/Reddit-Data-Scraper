    "postText": "I honestly had a really bad time at CNU, and I regret going there so much.  \nBefore I get into the meat of the post, I want to immediately get this out of the way: I am extremely biased, and my experience at CNU is not going to be representative of most people's experiences at the school.  I seem to be a magnet for bad luck. CNU is most certainly not a bad school, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows over at CNU no matter how green the Great Lawn may seem. This post is more or less going to be a rant, and long one at that since I want to capture as much of the experience as I can.\n\nI started attending CNU in the fall semester in 2017, and eventually decided to drop out midway through the 2019 fall semester after it proved to be more of the same.\n\nLet's get the good stuff out of the way.  \nThe learning community I was placed in was absolutely amazing, and the friends I made there stuck with me the entire time I was there. Most people were friendly, although it was cliquey. The campus is also undeniably beautiful. and despite the desperate cries of my coronary artery, I still long for the buffalo chicken wraps and the beloved tender Tuesday. The fondest memories I have of CNU are wandering around campus with my friends.   \n\n\nNow let's get into the meat of it. I'm going to go through my experiences at the school in chronological order. \n\nComing into the school freshman year, I found my footing pretty fast, and wasn't challenged very much the first semester. I actually had a pretty good time. The first class I ever sat down and took was a logic course focusing on symbolic logic. It was a very enjoyable class, taught by a very bright and understand professor.  We got to build simple robots in ENGR 121 and make them compete against each other, which was absolutely fun and a great way to get to know other students at the school. The professor who taught that class also had some very idealistic views about engineering and often talked about how the mindset needed to succeed in engineering is good for approaching problems in life in general, which I genuinely enjoyed. It resonated with me on a personal level, and made me feel very excited coming into CNU at the time.   \nHowever, as the semester went on, I ended up feeling less excited. Two of my other professors in particular were a bit questionable. One of them- My CPSC 125 professor- was a last minute hire with no teaching experience. I don't want to fault him too much since he was new to teaching, but it definitely was not a great experience in that class as a result. He often fumbled with the material a bit, but that's ok for the most part. What isn't ok is *him teaching us the material incorrectly.* A standard practice in the Comp Sci department is taking the overall course structure including lecture content, quizzes, and tests from the department so all of the classes end up with a similar experience. This would be fine, but this practice would come to bite me several times during my stay at CNU. In CPSC 125, our professor taught us one piece of the material incorrectly, then took quizzes from another teacher. In that quiz, it was done properly, so using the method he taught us would result in getting it wrong. That one kind of slipped under the radar for the most part. Only a few people noticed, and for the most part nothing like that happened again, but that problem would go on to become emblematic of the problems would face later on at CNU. \n\nI also had an American Studies class that was a constant headache. Our professor made us buy several books that we only used small excerpts from for one. Again, not the biggest deal, but come on. The quizzes and tests were terrible in that class. The class more or less just had us do assigned reading, and then come to class to analyze it. However, our teacher went out of his way to ask the most inane questions on assignments that were about *memorizing small details* about a work rather than understanding the work as a whole.  He wrote the single most egregious question I have ever seen on an assignment in my entire life. We were assigned Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum Address as a reading, and in it Lincoln says that an outside military force could not conquer the US in \"a trial of a thousand years\" but the real danger to the United States is a civil war. Our professor decided to ask us a question about that line in particular. Did he ask about the meaning of the line and the historical context of it? Of course not. The question he wrote was along the lines of \n\n\"Abraham Lincoln said that an outside military force could not conquer the US in a trial of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Years, but danger could arise from within. Complete the quote.\" with the choices being\n\nA. 100 years\n\nB. 1000 Years\n\nC. 10,000 years\n\nWhen I read that question, my jaw dropped. How could any person who has devoted their life to educating others write a question that misses the point that hard? Perhaps his intent was to have me remember that quote forever, because that question is burned into my mind permanently.\n\nLater on in the semester, he assigned us a reading at 8 pm via email the night before the class met that we needed to read before the class. When we met, he asked if we got his email, and I replied \"Yes, at 8 pm last night.\" He immediately got defensive, and said \"Well, I could have sent it earlier today.\" \n\nWhat kind of reasoning is that? That's the equivalent of someone saying \"You killed 4 people, how could you!?\" to you, and then deciding that the best reply is \"Well, I could have killed 8!\"\n\nThe class was just more of the same throughout the semester, with other squabbles like that happening semi-regularly.\n\nNow, I understand my complaints so far are admittedly pretty petty regarding this class, and you'd be right. However, these experiences would go onto shape my overall perception of CNU as time went on. Attending that class and thinking about how much I'm paying for it made me feel jaded. This semester was the height of my entire experience at CNU, and I only had good things to say about two of my classes. \n\nSo the first semester goes by without too much issue, aside from feeling a bit disappointed overall. However, registration came next. I think something was terribly wrong with the entire PCSE department that year, because most my peers got completely shafted during registration and had a lot of trouble getting into the classes they need for their major. I was pretty lucky in that I only needed an override into Math 240 (Which filled up about a day before I could even register). So I go to the office to get that all sorted out, and the guy there was noticeably irritated and was displeased to see me come in with the override form. I get it. The classes filled up, it's logistics nightmare, but don't take it out on me. They end up opening up another section, so everything is ok for the most part, but my peers couldn't say the same. The overall mood on my hall was doom and gloom. \n\nEnter the spring semester. It was pretty uneventful except for CPSC 150, which I'll get to  in a bit. I took Phil 202 with the same Phil professor I had last semester and enjoyed it a lot.  I don't want to name names in this post, but I'll make an exception for Professor Homan since I only have good stuff to say about him. Bless that man, I loved his classes. Aside from that, the first year writing seminar had very low expectations, and went over basic things that most people should have learned in middle school like how to cite sources. Econ 201 was super basic as well, and I literally played Starcraft during lectures and got a B still (Don't do this).   \n\n\nCPSC 150 I feel was officially \"the beginning of the end\". The professor I had explained everything very, very slowly. His lectures were around 2 weeks behind the other classes, to the point where even his own homework assignments were outpacing him. I distinctly remember him talking about something that we had to know over a week ago to  complete some homework, and he introduced it in class as if it were rocket science and we had never seen it in our entire lives. He said things along the lines of \"Now, I know this is very hard, but just keep at it, and we'll understand it all together, ok?\" I raised my hand and told him that we already did some problems like that on the homework, and he was taken aback, as if that were surprising. It felt pretty bad sitting in class since his lectures were more or less meaningless since we already had to learn the material beforehand. He also had this one quirk where he'd pull up a powerpoint and copy sentences on the powerpoint onto the white board by hand, which is just kind of silly. One day I noticed he stopped taking attendance, so I never showed up for his lectures ever again unless we had a quiz and I got an A. I will say that he was pretty good about helping students who asked for help and hosting office hours and such, so it's not as if there was a lack of effort on his part. It's just that the pace of the class was just way too slow, and it was to our detriment. Remember how I mention the CPSC department shares lectures and other material? This class was no exception. By the end of the year, we were so far behind in the material compared to other classes that we were an entire coding project behind. There were somewhere around 6 big projects in the semester (I can't remember the exact number) and we only ever made it to project 5 while the other sections taught by other professors made it through all 6. So effectively, by having him we were literally missing out on material. \n\nLet's take a quick minute to talk about housing. I was in the Santoro dorm. It wasn't great, but not the worst still. I was in a triple and it was pretty cramped in there, and our AC didn't work very well so our room was constantly uncomfortably hot for all of us. I guess that's about what you'd expect. The fire alarms were stupid sensitive, and they'd go off all of the time for stupid reasons like putting popcorn in the microwave for too long. There were a few times where it'd go off at 3 am or such, and we'd all have to march outside in our pajamas in the middle of the night. That's all not too crazy, but what nobody expected was for our ceiling in the hallway to start leaking. Near the end of the semester, a leak formed in the ceiling on our hall. It got bigger, and bigger, until the hallway had a perpetual yellow puddle in the hallway. Eventually they slapped down a big trashcan to collect the water, but that leak wasn't done yet. The ceiling tiles deteriorated, and collapsed into the trashcan. We kept trying to get someone to fix it, but the maintenance people kept giving us excuses, like saying it's the end of the school year and they need to cut into the wall to fix it which is a safety hazard or something like that. So a few weeks go by, and the leak is so bad that the water is seeping into people's doors and saturating their room carpets with water, which is absolutely gross. At that point our RA had just had it with it, and went to bat for us, nagging the maintenance people until they actually did something. Turns out their excuse about having to cut into the wall was exactly that- an excuse. Somehow it was ok for them to cut into the wall now that our RA nagged them. I mean, it's not like a huge puddle in the middle of the hallway is a safety hazard either, right?\n\nSo, despite having nightmares about the yellow puddle consuming us all, my first year came to a close, and I felt optimistic about the second semester still. I thought that I wasn't being challenged because it's just intro level stuff, and I got a bit unlucky with professors. Turns out I was wrong. My next year at CNU would be more of the same.\n\nWhen I signed up for CPSC 250 for my second year fall semester, the instructor was TBA. Naturally, I ended up with the same professor I had for 150 because my mom gave birth to me under a leaning ladder while knocking over salt shakers or something. And.... My professor did the exact same thing. Everything was the same, right down to us being one project behind the other class. However, he did even worse this time. He started to struggle with the material. The lectures he would go through were designed by another professor, and he wouldn't even look at them before coming to class. He fumbled through the material, making mistakes in his coding, making mistakes with his IDE, etc. Some classes he spent upwards of 20 minutes just trying to get his IDE (IDE being a program you use to write software on a computer) to work. Eventually it got to the point where he was completely stumped by a problem in the lecture, and he turned to us and asked US \"Does anywhere know how to do this?\" which is completely absurd! It's absolutely ridiculous to pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend a university, then have a professor ask *you* to show him how to solve problems in the lecture.\n\nI had CPEN 214 this year, and the class itself was fine. However we had to build circuits using breadboards, and the kits themselves had problems. The IC chips in the kit had their labels worn out so it was very hard to figure out what chip I was even looking at. Some of them flat out didn't work. They didn't show any damage, but testing them showed that the chips weren't functioning properly. It was infuriating to build a circuit  properly, and find that it doesn't work just because of faulty equipment. The kits were missing resistors, and finding proper resistors we needed to build circuits was a hassle. The most egregious example was busted capacitors. We had to build a decently large circuit that utilized capacitors, but some people had faulty ones that would completely ruin the circuit's output. It took forever for us to figure out what was wrong, since my friends and I just assumed we were building it wrong. Eventually it got to the point where we constructed the exact same circuits on different boards and some of them would work, and other wouldn't.  We narrowed it down to the capacitors. Switching capacitors from different kits out suddenly made the entire circuit work. So when it came time to turn in our work, we ended up having to pass around working capacitors between us so we wouldn't fail. When I say fail, I mean it. The circuit would completely not work at all with the faulty capacitors. Yay.\n\nNow enter Spring 2019.\n\nWe get to lovely CPEN 315. Our professor was a very nice guy, and clearly very knowledgeable. But he would always go into amazingly long tangents about things vaguely related to the material that was interesting, but really had little to do with the class. Very little was accomplished in the lectures. By now I had some other problems in my life related to health, and I started skipping the lectures pretty frequently. I kept texting my friend each day asking him if I missed anything, and 99% of the time he would say \"Nope. Not a thing.\" I ended up with a B in that class despite not attending frequently.  As for the lab side of it, I really don't like the curriculum for that lab at all. We had to once again build circuits on a bread board. However, the curriculum had us literally build the same circuit over and over again, but larger scale. It was the exact same design process, but just longer and more tedious to design and wire. Utterly pointless, and a waste of time. \n\nI also had some problems with another CPSC class, which I won't comment on too much. I'd just like to share a time when the professor put the attendance code up on the board without telling us, then yelled at us when we didn't see it, saying \"It was up there for 30 seconds, you need to be prepared for class!\". Yes. He literally said 30 seconds, as if that's an astronomical amount of time to set up your laptop, log into it, open the browser, navigate to scholar, and copy the code down. One of my classmates asked him \"Would you mind putting up there again?\" and he scoffed at her, and angrily said \"*YES, I DO MIND*, but I'll do it anyways.\" Real pleasant. The atmosphere was just a tiny bit hostile there. Just a bit.\n\nOverall, not a great year. Academically I felt disappointed since I still wasn't being challenged very much overall, and I felt like everything I had accomplished up to that point at CNU could have been done in half the time if the courses were more rigid, and the professors were more focused. It felt like based on the pace so far, it would be crazy to enter the workplace in just 2 years from then. I felt like I had barely grown, or barely learned anything at all so far. I just had no confidence in my education whatsoever. \n\nBut before we move onto my last semester at CNU, we have to cover Puddle 2: Santoro's Revenge. My dorm room at Potomac South also leaked water from the ceiling grate. Fantastic. Also there was... a small insect problem in my room. One night I woke up at about 4 AM to use the bathroom, and when I turned on the light, I heard a buzzing noise. I was wondering what it was, and I looked up at the ceiling grate. *A wasp climbed down through the vent and started buzzing around my bathroom*. I felt like I was in a scene from Aliens or something, so I just shut the door and walked away. I'm allergic to wasps, and people in my family react pretty poorly to stings, though it's not to the point where it causes spontaneous death. I used the lobby bathroom, went to sleep, and never saw that wasp again. I did end up finding more wasps in more room later on, which was less than pleasant. The room across from me had the same problem, so it was likely there was some kind of nest and nearby and they were getting into our rooms somehow. Yeah uh. Not the most fun experience my life, but I lived and at least I didn't have roaches everywhere or something. Oh yeah, the fire alarm also kept going off at 3 or 4 am in PoSo too. \n\nSo I come into my last semester at CNU hoping that things will be better. \n\nSpoilers: It wasn't. \n\nThat semester was giving me problems before it even started. So, I bought a parking pass, but didn't have a chance to pick it up since I moved in on the Sunday before classes due to scheduling problems. So I just say, \"Ok, I'll pick it up before class starts on Monday, and slap it on my car. It'll be fine, right?\" It wasn't fine, unless you define fine as being fined a fine by the university. That morning, I wake up at 6 am to make sure nothing stupid can happen with my parking pass. My class was at 8 am so I had plenty of time to get it sorted out. Here's the problem. I checked my email, and there's an email saying they'll start writing tickets at 7 am. *Their parking office opens at 9 am*. I checked the office to make sure that there really wasn't anyone there, and there wasn't. At this point I'm a little bit worried since I can already see people in golf carts writing tickets. I wandered around campus to find anybody who I could talk to, but it was a complete ghost town. Eventually I found some security guards, and they told me to just park in front of the library since that's public parking, and pick up my pass after my 8 am. So, I move my car there, and what do you know, there's a guy sitting outside the library writing tickets. He sees me get out of my car, and tells me I can't park there. I explained the situation to him, and said that the guards told me to park in front of the library. The guy just looked at me, paused for a moment, then said \"Well, you can park wherever you want, I'm still going to write you a ticket\" and drove off in his car. WTF? I got into my car, and started circling around campus looking for ideas. I ended up parking in front of the ticket office since nobody was there. So, at this point I was already incredibly stressed out and having a very bad day. I walked into my 8 am class around 20 minutes late, and fumed for the rest of the day about it. All of that was just incredibly unprofessional, and ridiculous to put up with. \n\nThe 8 am class I mentioned was CPSC 327. And guess what? There were more IDE problems. Our professor spent an entire class period trying to fix his IDE. Great. As a fun fact, I told my friend who attends JMU as a CS major about how I had so many professors have problems with their IDE and asked her if that happened at JMU, and she just laughed and said \"No, that's ridiculous!\"\n\nHonestly I don't remember much of  this semester either, aside from it being more of the same. Subpar curriculum overall, etc. I was getting to jaded and upset with the university at that point, and some health problems were starting to really get to me as well. Halfway through I really lost any drive and desire to keep going at that point, and I started looking into dropping out since CNU had not treated me well these past years. But that wasn't before **PUDDLE 3: SANTORO'S CURSE**. This time our washing machine at Rapp started leaking water everywhere. Saturated the entire dang carpet in front of it, and seeped water into my room as well. Great, I love it. Also our washer/dryer never worked right in the first place and doing laundry was hell on Earth, taking over 5 hours to do a small load. \n\nThere's one last loose end to tie up. Do you remember how I said earlier that my friends were having problems getting classes they need to graduate on time? My roommate in junior year has to take an extra semester at CNU *just because he couldn't get into classes he needed to graduate on time.* He literally did nothing wrong, and worked hard this entire time, but CNU's physics department shafted him. He was still considered a sophomore in terms of credits in my junior year. Same thing with another friend, who was also a CPEN major. So... Yeah. Fun times.\n\nSo, I ended up getting a medical withdraw since I wanted to take some time to sort out my health problems, and also reevaluate my career path up to that point since CNU gave me nothing but trouble. \n\nOverall, I felt that my education was lackluster, and it was really not worth the money at all. I never felt like I was developing as a professional at all, and I never felt any confidence in my own skills that I acquired throughout my time at CNU. I'm currently in the process of transferring to Virginia Tech, and I'll be started in the fall. \n\nAnyways, this post is super long, and I'm getting tired. I would have liked to write a more poignant conclusion, but I'm tired and burnt out. If there's anything I want you to take away from this, it's two things. The first is *sign up for PLP or Honors if you can*. PLP is the only way to ensure that you don't get screwed over by registration. If you want to avoid bad professors and have the privilege of *being able to graduate on time* sign up for PLP. I know the tone of this post has mostly been sarcastic, but I'm being serious about this. PLP will save you so many headaches. And the second lesson is.... Don't buy a washer/dryer combo. Seriously. They suck.",

I mostly enjoyed the courses within CE/CS (outside of the math curriculum) but I graduated in 2010 so obviously things can change a lot. There were a few of professors who were notorious for being bad, but on the whole they were pretty competent. The upper level CPEN classes where we got to mess with microcontrollers, FPGAs and logic analyzers were great, and I really enjoyed working on my capstone project. \n\nIt's a real shame that you had such issues with scheduling, because the CE program was pretty tight on what classes you had to take and there wasn't a lot of room for error. I dropped an early PHYS class because the professor was awful and had to take summer classes to catch back up, but when it came to scheduling each semester I did not have problems getting into the courses I needed. I remember getting stuck with the early morning classes sometimes, but not missing the course entirely.\n\nWere the CPEN 214 kits those tackleboxes with (I think) maroon tops and tan bottoms? If so those were unreliable when I took the class over a decade ago.\n\nHopefully you will find VT to be a better fit for you, it's a good school.",

The reason the freshman course is like that is because the number of people entering college without ANY knowledge of how to properly write a paper (especially of the research variety) is staggering. While frustrating for someone who knows how to do it, the professors are even more frustrated that they have to teach the basics to people who should already know them. Luckily I took AP English 11 and 12 in high school and my scores on the tests were high enough that I got to skip the freshman and sophomore English courses. I'm sure I would have been just as frustrated as you, otherwise.",

            "comment": "I also had some bad experiences at CNU but this one stuck out the most:\n\nFirst semester freshman year I had one professor who was brand new, he was like 30 and had a PhD from some random school. I think this was one of those credit wasting/ filler freshman seminar classes. Anyways he proceeded to give us no syllabus and the classes were completely unplanned, like one class we just went around the room in a circle and told stories... it was like some hippie dream job for him. The only graded assignment I want to say (there may have been more but this was like 7 years ago now) was a ten page, single spaced paper on \u201canything you want.\u201d Dead serious, no context at all. I wrote mine on pets because I like animals and their connection to people, but keep in mind this was freshman year for me so writing ten single spaced pages is a lot. One guy I knew just took a long history paper he wrote in high school and turned that in. The professor ends up fired after one semester and we all got As regardless of the work we did. Pretty disappointing intro to college to be honest and probably hurt my mindset overall because it didn\u2019t inspire me to work hard in school. Not an excuse for bad grades I graduated 3.0 and all that but my freshman grades weren\u2019t good, didn\u2019t put as much effort in as I should have. Oh and he smoked weed with some guys I knew. At least he got fired and the school realized he was a lunatic not ready for a teaching career. \n\nAlso had to use shitty out of date software that never opened for my business degree, instead of just teaching us in, ya know, excel or word like normal people use. I had some good professors and bad ones along the way, mostly stayed at CNU because of my friends there and the fact it was in VA and not unnecessarily far from home. After reading your post I can agree that the educational standards aren\u2019t as high as they should be if the school wants to claim itself on all these top ten lists etc. also I had a slightly more enjoyable time at CNU simply because we could move off campus after 2 years back then. Should still be that way IMO. Let people learn to live outside a bubble on their own and make decisions for themselves and learn to be responsible adults.\n\nEdit: just wanted to also state that my major-specific professors were all much better and more experienced than the Intro ones, which makes total sense. I do still believe they should invest in better intro teachers too though because 1) all the classes cost the same, and 2) you want to set up a good foundation for the students to continue to grow on",

As someone who just graduated this semester, I definitely encountered some of the frustrations you mentioned but nowhere near as bad as the experience you described.\u00a0As a Computer Engineering major myself, I actually came away from my four years having a very positive experience overall.\n\n  \nI never really had any issues trying to register for classes and was usually able to override ones that I needed and weren\u2019t able to initially get (I came in with some AP credits though which definitely helps come registration time). As for professors, I encountered several familiar faces throughout my four years of classes (especially in the PCSE department), but I saw this as a positive. My professors knew my name and who I was as a student, and I felt comfortable enough reaching out to them whenever I needed help with something. I think one of the strengths that CNU has over some of the bigger state schools is that you do have smaller class sizes and can utilize your connections and relationships with your professors for all kinds of things. For example, one of my professors who I had a close relationship with recommended me for an internship at NASA Langley a couple years ago, and I have been working there ever since. CNU and the PCSE department do seem to have the students\u2019 academic interest at heart in terms of quality of education and development of professional connections, which I appreciated and valued as a part of my undergrad experience.\n\nI just wanted to quickly put this out there as someone who did have a positive undergrad experience at CNU, especially for those who were considering it and are now on the fence. Nobody is going to have the same experiences wherever you go for school, and unfortunately it sounds like you encountered mostly negative ones during your time. Good luck to you at VA Tech, I hope that\u2019s a better fit for you!",

            "comment": "Lol I had a professor that\u2019s so bad at CNU first semester freshman year that he had to curve the final overall grade MORE THAN SIX POINTS in order to make the whole class pass. Most would have failed. And also I get what you mean, first semester for me was insanely stressful and pretty bad. I also know there are a few majors at cnu that are pretty notoriously bad, you may have just went into one of those. Now my room had problems as well and everything wasn\u2019t handy dandy, but CNU is still one of the greatest  times of my entire life. Now that may be cause I have a insanely shitty home life and my high school (along with my home life) was so god awe full that it single handedly gave me clinical anxiety and clinical depression, as well as insomnia and a few other mental disorders. So comparatively for me, if I have friends and a halfway decent education, CNU will still be phenomenal. Just my scenario though",

            "comment": "This is actually super discouraging. I was really excited to go to CNU once i realized that with the addition of 2-3 courses, i could double major in computer science and computer engineering because i took most of my core computer engineering at SBU (including the ones you've mentioned here if they transfer) only to realize i love software more (but i do like working with hardware). Doing the double major may allow me to do the 5-year program in CS, which was exactly what i wanted at SBU and isn't something i can do at many schools. Only CNU from what i've seen.\n\nAlso disappointed to hear about the dorming situation bc i was actually excited to finally move out and into one of the upperclassmen apartments since id have my own room and bathroom. And the apartments just sounded nice and i was sitting here wondering how i would afford it, but i definitely would not want to figure it out just to deal with so many issues.\n\nKinda reconsidering CNU now, which means i have no idea where to go or what i'm doing.\n\nJust when i thought i had my life together... lol",

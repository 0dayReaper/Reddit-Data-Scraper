    "postText": "Hey there, I'm currently a High School Senior deciding between JMU and CNU. I applied to for Comp Sci, and considering Comp. Eng. as well. I'll be posting the same exact posts in both subreddits, so, yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main things I want to consider is opportunity after college, cost, and social life. From my understanding, JMU is a lot more lively than CNU, but with the smaller size at CNU, close-knit relations are created with professors and students. Alongside this, CNU is right next to the Jefferson Lab, which may offer great internship opportunities and just a nicer area to get a small job after college. I know CNU also has a 5 year master program, but I'm not sure if I'll take that. Really, I'm just not sure which one to go to. I have been to both CNU and JMU and loved both their campuses, except JMU, funnily enough, smelled like dog food -- I'm sure that was just a one-time thing. I'm mostly concerned for my future with opportunities, and cost. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",

            "comment": "As far as after-college opportunities go, CNU does have some good ones. They also have a partnership with Ferguson (toilet and plumbing business), which may or may not help you. As far as cost goes, expect to pay about $250 for parking, roughly $1000 for a lot of meal swipes with decent food, and the tuition/housing you can look up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for social life. CNU has a student population around 5,000 with over 3,000 of them being females. With a campus this small, you will run into someone you know everyday. It won't be too hard to maintain friendships. On the flip side, if you get on bad terms with your friend group, news can travel fast. You can still meet entirely new people who are disconnected from your friends, but they will have started to form their own friendships and friend groups. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm not saying don't go to CNU. I'm saying you could probably find an opportunity somewhere else after you graduate. Unless you really like strip malls and traffic.\n\nI do have a friend that went to W&amp;M and ended up doing data requisition for Ferguson. He got paid pretty well to do it. Like someone else mentioned, CNU has a connection to Ferguson,  so that might be worth it.",

            "comment": "I'm a senior in CS at CNU right now. The department has been gaining a good reputation with companies all over the state in both the private and government sectors. The thing is about picking a school for many engineering and science majors is that you will learn very similar things as all other schools, but one school may offer different elective classes that another doesn't.\n\nCNU has been adding more CS elective classes each semester but it's probably not as many as JMU offers due to it's large student size. I would recommend looking at some the classes that both of the college's offer and see if any peek your interest.\n\nWhen it comes to getting job, you will find that it means less about your school and your GPA, but rather your in class and out class work. If you you want a good internship or job, work on something out of class that you really like doing. Weather it's a game or website, it shows initiative to learn and create and companies love that. This goes for any college you end up at. Other big engineering schools such as JMU may have more companies looking for students, but also has way more students that want the same thing as you. \n\nBesides academics, CNU does have a great campus that is being continuously upgraded. It's not big which means less walking when raining and more time to hangout between classes. The dorms are pretty nice when you get to the later years, but can be a little cramped in the first 2 years if you are unlucky.\n\nI hope some of this info helps. If you want to talk more about or have more questions, PM me and I'll try to answer them.",

            "comment": "Currently a junior in the CS department.\n\nCNU has really good opportunities post grad for PCSE Majors (Physics, Computer Science and Engineering department). The school hosts multiple career fairs per semester on campus in the Student Union. One of these Career fairs is PCSE specific and only hosts companies looking for students in those majors. This makes it extremely easy to find internship opportunities for summer between academic years and post graduation jobs. \n\nIn addition to this they also work with different companies and host interviews on campus for real world jobs. Companies like GDIT, Ferguson, ADP. The Center for Career Planning will send out emails where you can sign up for an interview slot and then you'll meet with one of the companies recruiters for a meeting/interview.\n\nLastly there is something called Pizza My Mind which is every Thursday during lunch block (a hour window in which no classes take during the middle of the day). Each time one company comes in and presents what they do and what kind of students they are looking to recruit. After the presentation you can go and talk to the team of workers and recruiters they brought with them and they'll tell you how to apply for positions. These events are nice because they order pizza for all attendees and going to a majority of the Pizza My Mind events during each semester will net you Extra Credit in PCSE classes (usually a few % boost to your final grade).",

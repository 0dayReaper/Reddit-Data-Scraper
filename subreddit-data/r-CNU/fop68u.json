                    "comment": "Individual department chairs decide how many seats  and what classes they want to give to freshmen. Since upperclassmen have more classes to choose from (100-400 levels), departments must save most lower level (100-200, and some 300 levels) seats for freshmen.  \n\nOnce the registrar's office registers a majority of freshmen, the the enrollment numbers are provided to department chairs who then decide if they want to increase the enrollment caps, move a classroom in order to allow for more enrollments, or keep the class as is. \n\nFor years the registrar staffers (not registrar management) voiced concerns that the \"wrong\" classes are being held for freshmen. For example, a large population of incoming freshmen will transfer GOVT 101, HIST 121 and/or 122 from dual enrollment or AP credits. Because of this, we know that we don't need to hold that many seats of AIDE and AIWT for freshmen, but it happens anyway. Also, registrar staffers HATE register freshmen in religion or theater classes, especially if the student did not specifically ask for one of those classes. The amount of students and parents that complain about religion or theater on their schedule during Setting Sail in insane. Still the departments want us to move students into those classes.\n\nIf it helps, registrar staffers dislike freshmen seat holds just as much as you. We don't get a say in the matter and we know that the outcome, year after year, leaves the student body frustrated.",

During my time in the office, those ladies did an amazing job.  \n\nOne of the first things a degree auditor should do is look  to see if a comparable course is offered at one of the Virginia Tidewater Consortium (VTC) schools in the fall semester. This matters if your needed course is a major requirement. \n\nIf the course is not offered through the VTC, then they will look for it at another state school, preferably one in driving distance from CNU or online. A state school is because they want you to be able to pay your home state's tuition, if possible.  \n\nIf that is not possible, they will suggest that you speak to your adviser or department chair to see if a possible alternate class is available. They will be may be cagey with the wording of this because they are not allowed to tell you to ask your adviser or department chair for a course substitution.\n\n Lastly, if a fall course is not possible, then they will repeat the entire process again, but this time for a spring course. If they can, they will try to find a course near your home or online that will allow you to return home so that you are not spending extra money to take one class at CNU in the spring.\n\nKeep all of these steps in mind if you speak with a degree auditor.  There has been a lot of staff turnover in that office so be sure to kindly and respectfully advocate for yourself if need be, if the current staffers are not so helpful.",

He was assigned the 4th day of class registration for fall 2020 &amp; says most classes he needs are already nearly full. I\u2019m assuming your suggestion to speak with a degree auditor is his best bet if those classes fill? Thanks! (It\u2019s so frustrating; he went from potentially graduating early to perhaps not graduating on time...and his 529 can\u2019t support that.)",

Also have him look into taking credit(s) through the Virginia Tidewater Consortium. 300-400 level bio lectures and sometimes lectures and labs are offered at ODU, Hampton, or Virginia Wesleyan and even more, these classes may be online, which is important if living costs or travel are impacted. He must also determine if the 300-400 level bio credits can be met through independent study. He needs to consult with his adviser or department head for that info.  Lastly, he must explain what \"most classes are full\" means. I say this because sometimes the class a student wants to take is full whereas a class that meets the same requirement is not. Also, he needs to consult with his adviser or department head to see if they are accepting waitlists for full classes. If so, he needs to add himself to a waitlist. That will let the department know that students are interested in the class and perhaps make the department consider adding more seats or opening a new section.",

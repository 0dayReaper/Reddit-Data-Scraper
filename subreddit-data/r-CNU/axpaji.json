    "postText": "I personally do not attend, but know a few students here. One of them I talked to almost every day during high school. When I heard of his passing, i cried for weeks and weeks on end. I posted about him and how terrible i feel about not doing enough. His mother at first was very supportive, but soon turned against me. Because i am not a student here and didnt hang out with him outside of school like his \u201creal friends\u201d, i have no right to talk about him according to her. He did so much to help me very supportive and a great listener one of the best potential comedians imo. I don\u2019t hate her. I know shes going through a lot of pain. It\u2019s that i personally insult her on some illogical level and I hate it.\n\nI still miss him dearly. Loses this painful are rare but so strong.\n\nHis brother hates me too, why you ask? I put my hand on his shoulder, and it triggered him. So that\u2019s fantastic.\n\nP.S: If you know who I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t tell me I have no right talking to her that way. I have been NOTHING but polite abd respectful towards her in a private way. This is the first time I spoke about my frustration. Why do I deserve this amount of disrespect just because I wasn\u2019t important enough for her to know all about? I also didn\u2019t know until the week was over that this happened to him.",

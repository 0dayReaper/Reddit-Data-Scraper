    "postText": "I've got an incoming freshman this fall and I was hoping to get some insight into anyone's experiences concerning laptops (and any peripherals) at CNU. What type of support did you get and what experiences you had fixing broken laptops? Experiences with CNU IT Services? Additional software through student licenses available? I'm sure to go with Dell and willing to go higher end - there's just not much detail on the IT Services web page so I thought I'd see if I can get some first hand stories before calling... thanks much in advance!!",

We thought he\u2019d be doing loads of statistical modeling, etc.  Because of this (and because he intends to go on to grad school), we bought him a pretty high end 15 inch Dell - with the guarantee that they\u2019d come to campus for any necessary repairs. He\u2019s not had any problems and is still quite happy with it\u2019s performance.",

There are whole boards on here to help you figure out what computer is best for your needs, I\u2019ll try to find one for you.\n\nEdit: try r/suggestalaptop but make sure to read their rules before posting",

But if your student is just looking to have help with a relatively simple problem, IT Services is pretty great at helping out.",

It\u2019s been a while but it\u2019s a decent amount of reading but most of the grade comes from research/opinion/synthesis writing, so as long as you\u2019re sincere about it you can do well. The lectures are very different and something to look forward to. I would say 6/10 in terms of difficulty.",

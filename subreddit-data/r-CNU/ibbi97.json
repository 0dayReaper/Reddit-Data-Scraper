I figure we won\u2019t be there for too long, but personally, I need a break from being home. With that being said, do you guys trust other students to be smart with the virus and truly limit the amount they party as well as follow the guidelines set in by the school?",

They\u2019ll keep doing what they did last year, and be surprised when we get sent home again. I\u2019m not expecting more than a month but at that point CNU will be caught between sending us home on time or waiting for the first refund deadline to pass so they won\u2019t owe us as much money. Really hoping to be proven wrong but given there are already cases on campus I can\u2019t see it getting any better.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much since this is literally a pandemic, and people are trying to go to school for their own reasons. I\u2019m also giving it about a month. Heard something about people with apartment suites have an easier time staying on campus if they close as they can sustain themselves with food. I personally wouldn\u2019t mind that as it\u2019d benefit me, but not sure how realistic that even is.",

It would certainly be nice though as I\u2019m not exactly looking forward to being home again for longer than I have to be",

I\u2019d give it until the first refund deadline before we go fully online :(",

It is not often that anyone feels comfortable sharing their personal medical conditions that can put themselves at risk, and expect others to make the right decisions. Not only am I glad I'm able to take classes remotely now, but also highly concerned for a few that I know that are less fortunate. I can only hope that when the Admin does announce to shift everything back to online, the timing of that happening does not count as a too-little-too-late type of situation.",

Masks are being enforced and visitors limited, although it is a bit more lenient in the apartments more than then on main campus. The only thing I\u2019ve heard about was a \u201cfrat party\u201d (which was more like a 15 person get-together outdoors) off campus, that people freaked out over. Class capacity will most likely be 15-20 and socially distanced, and the risk there will be just as high. As long as people aren\u2019t throwing absolute ragers, then we will be alright.",

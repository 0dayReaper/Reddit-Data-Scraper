    "postText": "I have a kid at VT - they offer a guest account that a student can invite others (parents for example) by email address people they want to allow to see their unofficial transcripts. You guessed it - I also have a kid at CNU and wonder if they have something similar? Just asking here before I call the Registrar's office with the question and ask my kid. Nothing nefarious going on, we're looking into some summer classes at NVCC and I'm expecting they will want transcripts at some point.",

Hopefully you can ask your child directly for the form and they will supply, as they should know how by at least their second semester. I doubt the registrar has the ability to provide you with that information even if you ask because you are not the student. Hope that clears it up a little.",

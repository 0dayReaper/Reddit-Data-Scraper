I figure the school probably won't want to because it would increase covid exposure, but I also can see the school lightening up on at least that one restriction. Just wanted to hear peoples' general thoughts.",

As someone in a housing thats for a class other than their own, believe me I wish they would announce tomorrow that its over, but I dont think thats any time soon.",

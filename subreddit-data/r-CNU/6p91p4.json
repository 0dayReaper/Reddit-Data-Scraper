    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to be a freshman this fall, and was wondering if buying a Chromebook instead of a full laptop would be a good idea. I'll be majoring in Computer Science and also will be in the PLP. If I do end up buying a Chromebook, I'm thinking about possibly bringing my desktop too. Any feedback on what I should buy/bring would be greatly appreciated!",

I would think as long as you have the desktop in your room you could do what you need to in class with the Chromebook with the IDE. Also you might eventually need to install Visual Studio depending on when and if you take the C# class.",

            "comment": "all you'll need for PLP is Microsoft Office, especially Word, but you can definitely get away with using Google's apps to do all the same things.  You'll have lots of writing assignments and projects throughout the years. But word of caution, the formatting tends to get messed up when trying to send documents to the printer, so it's still a good idea (at least for writing assignments) to have Word, simply to check formatting and print from there. Profs will dock points if you formatting is always off, even if it's not your fault. ",

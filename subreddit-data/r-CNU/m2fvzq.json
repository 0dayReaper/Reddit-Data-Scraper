            "comment": "As the other comment so far said, the most important thing for you to do to set yourself up for a good experience is to find a club or organization and make yourself a part of it. Hopefully things will change a little more before you arrive in the fall, but right now it is difficult to make friendships in class or out and about, so diving in with an organization can give you a place and a group of people early on which is good. Personally I\u2019m in the marching band and car club here on campus and both groups are fun to be around and have provided me with the majority of my on campus relationships. Don\u2019t fret too much about the first semester schedule and if you don\u2019t know what you major is yet that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s important to keep an open mind and remember that everyone else in your freshman class will be new to this too. You picked a pretty good school to go to imo",

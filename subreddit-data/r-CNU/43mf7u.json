If you're in the area, try to make it to this year's drag ball. (It is mega fun, bring a friend) The campus is a bit conservative, but overall it's mostly accepting. You'll be ok. Don't know anything about LoL or Smash Bros clubs, but there should be a list of clubs online somewhere. ",

It's not too difficult to start a club.",

Community (we have relationships with William &amp; Mary and Old Dominion University and have many tournaments), a good number of people who play League of Legends, including numerous diamond-level players, and several CS:GO teams that compete in collegiate tournaments. Feel free to join the group on Facebook or ask me anything here!",

There's some sort of League within CNU, but it's very casual and not taken very seriously. That being said you shouldn't have a problem if you just want to find people to play with.\n\nThe LGBT community here is from my understanding, very good. I've never seen any homophobia on campus and I hear spectrum is really cool. \n\nAlso, I recommend finding time on the weekend to walk the whole Noland trail by the Mariner's museum. It's very beautiful.",

Check us out on Facebook we don't use compass for shit\n\nSame with eSports at CNU \n\nIf everything goes according to plan here's what we're gonna be doing\n\nWeekly tournaments on Friday, called Captain Hook.  Smash 4 and Melee.  Idk if they're keeping the same schedule so I'm not gonna say anything about that. It may seem super intimidating at first but everyone is super nice and really helpful.  On top of the weeklies we're hopefully gonna have two bigger events (names TBD)\n\nNotable people that come through \n\nMelee/PM: lloD, Mom, Malco, Milkman, DanSoFree, Reslived \n\nSm4sh: Chas, Puppeh.  Not as big in smash 4 yet but working on it \n\nAlso like we're pretty bad here.  If you show up to like 3 tournaments you'll end up on the PR. People come out and just take our money lmao \n\nBasically we're friendly as fuck, stream a lot, run Melee and Smash 4. I want them to bring back PM but we'll see. ESports at CNU also runs other tournaments, so league, SFV, whatever the fuck else \n\nI'm Birdman, mainly melee Falco, so if you see me introduce yourself ",

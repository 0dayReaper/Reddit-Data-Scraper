    "postText": "Schools like UVA and Tech get their roommates relatively early.  This gives the students time to get to know the people they\u2019ll be living with before they start living with them.  Two weeks is not nearly enough time, it\u2019s basically like throwing two random animals in a zoo together and saying congrats, you\u2019re roommates.  Things could go fine, or things could go terribly wrong.  Telling us who our roommates are well in advance would give us time to kinda feel out the other person\u2019s quirks and personality, but two weeks? Also does anyone have a clue as to how to even find out who my roommate is now? cnu live only shows the residence hall and room I have",

I think that the pandemic created lots of uncertainty as to if, and how, CNU was going to reopen fully, or with modifications, which caused a long delay. Once it was decided, housing had to scramble to make all the assignments. It sucks for everyone.",

Maybe if I had weeks or months to get to know him before moving in I would have swapped rooms quicker. I can almost guarantee that there are groupme chats or Facebook groups for your building and maybe even floor. The best thing to do is try and coordinate there to find roommate/suitemates",

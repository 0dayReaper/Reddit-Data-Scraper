I appreciate that nobody wants to hurt our feelings, but we really need to know what we can do better.\n\nI can see why so many people have had trouble starting this sort of business. This takes a ton of work, and it hasn't been easy for us to juggle school and Captains Cookies. I just wish I had more time to put into Captains Cookies. Building a business out of nothing takes a lot of time, but thanks to suggestions like yours we're getting there.",

I almost started one of these myself but decided against it for this very reason (the fear that someone would come out and sue my ass over a recipe). Good luck though! ",

    "postText": "Hello, so I know this is more of an opinion based question, but after long consideration, I think I am going to commit to CNU. I am quite interested in computers, so I think both majors are extremely viable options for me. I understand the difference between the two majors, yet I still can't decide. I also wanted to ask a bit on the whole, how plausible is getting internships at NASA. I'm really intrigued, and definitely want to give it my all when trying to apply to NASA, I just wanted to know how realistic it is. I know CNU is located near the Jefferson Lab and the Langley Research Center, so I figured that it's pretty reasonable as long as grades are good, and connections are made. Thank you for your help!",

            "comment": "It's been a while since I graduated so I can't guarantee this information is up to date (though I just glanced at the course catalog and things look about the same to me) but if you aren't sure between CE and CS, start out with CE because it's easier to go from CE to CS than the other way around if you change your mind. For example, CE requires PHYS 201 and PHYS 202 which can also apply for CS but the minimum for CS is PHYS 151 and PHYS 152. If you start out with the minimum on the CS track, you'll need to take extra courses if you decide you'd rather do CE later on.\n\nAs for internships, there are a few programs at NASA Langley. The DEVELOP program tended to have a lot of CNU students. It's certainly not unrealistic to expect to get an internship at NASA, just realize you may not end up working on space-stuff during your internship. I also had some friends who interned at Jefferson Lab and enjoyed that.\n\n",

My suggestion to you, whichever major you pick, is to look into joining the UAS (unmanned aerial systems) team. It's a great group of students, and it gets really nice support from the department and the university. With your interest in NASA, it might be a good fit for you and be a nice addition to your resume.",

            "comment": "I did both CS and CE. I can say that CE is way more intense, but there is a lot of overlap. If you know you're going to put in the work, I'd recommend CE, as it is an ABET accredited program and you get a lot of the CS fundamentals anyway. Any job that requires a CS degree will probably also accept a CE degree, but not necessarily the other way around.\n\nIt is very common for students in the department to take internships with NASA or JLAB. Additionally, there is a recruiting event each week hosted by the department where they bring in a company or organization to buy you pizza and tell you why you need to work for them.\n\nMy best advice in general is to find a club or group that piques your interest and get some practical experience that way. Employers love extracurricular projects and many groups like the Unmanned Aerial Systems team, the Cybersecurity Research Group, or the Game Development Club can really help.",

            "comment": "Both are great degree programs. If you think you are going to be a programmer or something close to that, CS might be best. However, if you have any interest at all in hardware projects, give CE a lot of thought. I wish I had taken that route when I was at CNU. I walked out of CNU and into the embedded programming industry, and a CE degree would have made the OTJ learning curve a bit easier. However, both programs will prepare you, and you can do a bit of mix-and-match if you want. When I was at CNU, getting both degrees didn't take a lot of extra time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you never do anything but strictly writing or debugging code, then CS is fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you are like me and find yourself playing with Arduino, Raspberry PI, embedded 6502 and 68k series stuff, and other, the CE stuff helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving said that, a CS degree and a minor or partial degree in Electronics might be even better, for anyone interested in embedded work.",

You have to go to a few random campus events of your choosing and write a one page summary. And there is a stipend depending on your gpa. Plus Dr. Paul is a homie. Really nothing to lose and it\u2019s a decent resume booster",

You get scholarship money, you get to replace lame classes with cool classes, and your gen ed requirements are much lower. Plus you get the option to turn internships into credits. I turned 2 summers worth of internships into 6 credits. Also Jay Paul is the man",

The program itself has to many inconsistencies with what they WANT from you compared to what their mission truly is. Unless you are desperate for money the GPA requirement and guidelines WILL make life harder for you then it needs to be.\n\n (Also to add leadership freshman year is not new concepts and anyone who has worked a job before could easily teach the class with how elementary the curriculum is)",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m commuting this year could someone please let me know where are the best spots to park at? And are we allowed to park in the parking lots that are labeled as main campus residents or just the ones that says daytime students? \n\nAlso, would you guys recommend purchasing a parking pass now or waiting a bit to see how things goes. \n\nAnd any areas/rooms on campus that are good for my online classes\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "The commuter pass is only for the parking lot on east campus right next to where Moes used to be. I\u2019m living off campus this year and am going to be biking/walking to class, I\u2019d recommend doing that if you live close enough. As you might know the parking enforcement guys at CNU are not the nicest, and you can\u2019t park anywhere on campus with a commuter pass. After 5 PM open parking starts and you can park anywhere without a pass.",

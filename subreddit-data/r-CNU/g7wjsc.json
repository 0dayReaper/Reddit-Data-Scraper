    "postText": "\\- My family and I will be moving to Langley AFB so I'm applying to CNU this November. Do I have live on-campus as a freshman or do I have the option to live with my parents? \n\n\\- I am interested in Computer Science program and Army ROTC. Any ROTC cadets who can provide some insights? is it a combined ROTC classes with William &amp; Mary? where are the classes taken? What are the pros and cons being in ROTC and Comp Sci workload?\n\n\\- Is the face-to-face interview a deal breaker when I apply for Early Decision? \n\nThank you all in advance.",

            "comment": "You don't have to live on campus as a freshman if you're living with your parents on base, but I agree with the sentiment that you'll be a lot better off living with other students. For the most part, it's a social thing. CNU is pretty big on socialization - as a Freshman, you'd be living on the same hall as other people in your major, so you can get to know the people you'll see often over the next 4 years. Besides that, there's tons of events, not just by the University, but by the many student organizations on campus. While it is cheaper to live off-campus, it can be very beneficial to live on campus. Part of going to college is learning to handle yourself and live on your own away from your parents.\n\nWhile I can't speak to the ROTC program at CNU, I can speak a bit to the workload of Comp Sci. Comp Sci by itself is pretty heavy, and I know of many people that almost failed the program and some that switched to a similar major, Information Science.\n\nETA: I saw that you asked about the meal plan in another comment, and if you are adamant about living off campus, don't bother with a meal plan. It's overpriced unhealthy food. CNU staff associated with the dining halls take pride in the fact that \"It's not the Freshman 15 here, it's 20!\"",

So, I just bring a lunch for the break in between and go to the gym then to class. Or I just buy food from places near by. There are some good restaurants near campus. Hope this helps!!",

They require an interview, but I live about 4 hours away, does anyone know if they'd be willing to interview me through Skype or something? Also, I missed the priority deadline, so will that hinder my chances of getting in either?",

The earlier you apply, the better your chances are, they'll usually get more selective as they fill up more and more slots. Do it all as soon as possible, that's my recommendation",

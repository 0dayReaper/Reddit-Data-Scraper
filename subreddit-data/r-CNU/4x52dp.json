            "comment": "What you want is [an ethernet switch (ideally a gigabit one because CNU will give you way more than 100Mbps that the cheaper ones support)](https://smile.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Gigabit-Ethernet-Desktop-TL-SG1005D/dp/B000N99BBC/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471213664&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=ethernet+switch) and a few spare ethernet cables to go with it. In addition to not functioning well with many consumer electronics (such as game consoles or media players like Apple TVs) due to its security settings, CNU WiFi is notoriously unreliable because of all the people connecting to it in such close proximity. If possible, anything that you can connect with ethernet should be set up that way.\n\nPlus, if nothing else, CNU's internet is *ridiculously* fast - like, 900 Mbps downloads late at night when nobody is using the network type of fast - and you won't get anywhere near the speeds over WiFi that you do with a cable.",

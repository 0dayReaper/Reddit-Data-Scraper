They now teach some Python and/or JavaScript in 125, and 360 is totally dedicated to learning to pick up and work with new languages - it covers introductions to C#, C, LISP, Prolog, Python, and PHP. CS grads are also required to take 330, which is covers MIPS Assembly.",

Not sure about CS, but everyone in the CE program had a job lined up either before graduation or soon after.\n\nNot sure how it is now, but as others have said it was very Java centric when I was there. That's not really a problem though, because learning any programming language will teach you most of what you need to learn any others. Even though I only had part of one class focused on C++, that's the language I've been the most for my job and it's been fine.\n\nNot sure this is even on your radar, but if you even slightly suspect you might be interested in learning about the hardware a little more in depth (as well as touch on cool stuff like microcontrollers and FPGAs) you might want to start out in the CE program. There is a LOT of overlap between the two, but the math and physics courses tend to be a little higher level in CE than in CS. If you start out in CE and decide that it's not for you, it's easy to transition to CS (plenty of people in my program did) but if you start out in CS and decide CE sounds cool you'll have a harder time of it.",

My first job post graduation (which I still hold) is software development for a major software company. Make sure you have relevant internships during the summers and you'll do fine.",

    "postText": "I posted something similar to the tech board, but I thought I\u2019d ask here too (and join the hordes of other high school seniors asking for advice) to see more sides! \n\nI live in Virginia, and I\u2019m currently planning on going to law school after undergrad. Since my parents are pushing me to go to the cheaper of the schools I was accepted into, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to Tech, CNU, and VCU. CNU and VCU offered me money (5k +2k study abroad for the commonwealth scholar honors/plp thing at CNU, and 3k at VCU.), but Tech isn\u2019t substantially more expensive than the other schools because of that.\n\nRegardless of where I go to, I\u2019m planning on double majoring in either psychology and political science, or English and political science. Would you say that CNU does a good job at preparing someone for a good law school as opposed to larger institutions like VCU and Tech?  I\u2019ve also read a lot about people dropping CNU\u2019s leadership and honors programs because of unnecessary stress from requirements, is that true?\n\n(I know many people also decide not to go to law school later on, but the other fields I\u2019m interested in would still require at least a graduate education, (likely in a field like psychology/non-stem) so this would apply to that as well.)\n\nThanks in advance! I\u2019m trying to make a decision this week, and I thought an outside opinion would be helpful!",

            "comment": "I can't really say much in regards to your perspective on pre-law, other than I know a lot of those professors work pretty hard for their students. As an Accounting major, since we are liberal arts, I had to take a course involved with a professor from pre-law who does take her work very seriously, but worked with her students and made herself available for help.\n\nWhen it comes to PLP/honors, I am a bit more experienced in that. PLP I wouldn't say requires you to do \"too many\" hours, considering people go to volunteer 1-2 times a week for a small amount of time and are still able to fill those requirements. The only parts that are kind of annoying would be attending speakers and other events, but you get to choose those extra events, and the speakers aren't too bad themselves. Most of the people I know (including myself) are only involved with PLP, since it's easier than having the extra workload and requirements from honors. From what I've heard and seen, honors is a lot of work and effort, but PLP is definitely more laid back. \n\nOverall I'd say it comes down to what you're comfortable with and what you can handle. I wish the best of luck to you.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re really interested in moving on to grad school, especially in law, I recommend applying for PLP. I\u2019ve been in the program for a year now. The hours of community service are not that extensive  (an hour or two a week does the trick) and yeah maybe the events can get tedious occasionally, but let me tell you the real benefit of PLP:\nNetworks and Prestige.\nMajority of the students that graduate successfully from PLP (and a good GPA helps too, of course) get into their grad school OF CHOICE. Being a PLP graduate shows grad schools and future employers that you\u2019re serious; it shows them you\u2019re driven and that you\u2019re looking to make a real impact and organizations love to see that, and need to see that from young people trying to enter any field.\nYou\u2019re also encouraged to do internships as part of PLP. This means making real connections in the real world, getting your name out there, and potentially having a job lined up for yourself before you\u2019re even done with school.\nWhile part of the program, you can get tired of the classes, and the speakers, and the required events, but it isn\u2019t actually all that much extra work, especially when you consider the benefits from it as you move on the graduate and professional world.\n\nTLDR: PLP is worth it.",

            "comment": "Honestly, our Pre-Law program isn't half bad, and I absolutely love our Political Science and Psychology departments .\n\nAs far as PLP/Honors, most students drop it after the first year because of the stringent requirements. You need to maintain at least a 3.5 GPA and for PLP you have to do a crap ton of service hours each semester to remain in the program. \n\nUltimately, if you do decide to come to CNU, I would highly encourage you not to join the PLP/Honors program. From what I've heard from many students, the payoff isn't worth the work you have to put into it.",

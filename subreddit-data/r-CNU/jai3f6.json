Doubtful though, considering how this semester has been.",

I, an alumnus, am in quarantine right now because I stayed with my girlfriend and her roommate who both live off campus, and the roommate was in contact with a classmate whose roommate tested positive. The classmate (whose roommate TESTED POSITIVE) was not directed to quarantine, and wasn't mandated to get a test either. Thankfully, the classmate did go get tested negative, but since he didn't quarantine, that one case could've spread to at least 20 people, and that's just from his contact with my girlfriend's roommate (thankfully, they were wearing masks and socially distanced). I guess I don't NEED to quarantine, but I am limiting spread just in case.",

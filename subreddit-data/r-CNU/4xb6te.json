    "postText": "I have social anxiety disorder and I'm going to be going in as a freshman this fall, and I want to honestly cry. It's two days until move in and I feel so scared, insecure, and I keep thinking I will be quiet and no one will like me or want to be friends with me. I want to stay home where I'm comfortable. I was at Setting Sail and I was quiet literally the whole time. I hated myself and I didn't understand why I was being like this. I don't even think this is the appropriate subreddit to be posting this, but I didn't know where else to post this. I just HATE self-loathing and I hate this stupid disorder that makes me feel like this. I don't even need advice, I just wanted to anonymously vent. ):\n\n\nEDIT: I just wanted you guys to know that I am so shocked at the community and how you guys are so loving and caring. God bless all of you -- seriously. I've met a ton of people through direct messaging who want to hang out, and for the first time in my life I actually am making more plans than I know what to do with. The tunnel is dark but it seems like there is some sort of light at the end of it all. I appreciate the outpouring of support. Y'all are bomb. I knew CNU was the right decision for me. :)",

I'm still not, really, but you learn to fake it. I loved my time at CNU (graduated in 2010), and even the very first day I met people who I am still friends with even though we've scattered across the country.\n\nAnxiety isn't really something someone can just \"stop\" feeling because they want to, but hopefully this will help some: Almost everyone else is excited AND nervous, even most of the people who seem like they are not. First day jitters are totally normal. Move in day will be chaotic with everyone coming in and meeting everybody else for the first time, but you'll get through it and into the swing of things in no time.",

You are bound to find people with similar passions, hobbies, classes, etc. I can speak from experience that CAB, Elevation, and Res Life helped me find a strong circle of friends, and I've heard similar things about many other groups (including general Greek life and major studies fraternities/sororities). It may not happen immediately, and social anxiety is not necessarily going to go away, but if you put the time and effort into finding somewhere that you're comfortable, I guarantee your years at CNU are going to be so fulfilling! Leave you're door open! Say hi to people outside! Sit with someone else who is alone at lunch! I graduated in 2013, but feel free to send me a PM about anything, you're seriously going to be fine!",

Therapy helped a ton, and the biggest thing I learned was that these thoughts are all made up and offer me no value whatsoever, they are a massive detriment to my success. You are going to do great. If you feel like you slip up the first few days that is perfectly fine (you aren't alone!) but you can ALWAYS improve. Here are a couple good quotes to think about. \n\n\"I can accept failure, I can not accept not trying\" - Michael Jordan \n\n\"Eighty percent of success is showing up\" -Woody Allen\n\nHave fun, message me if you need any help at all!",

I still have little spurs of insecurity/think I'm lonely but I know those are lies and I try and kill them right there and then because I know I'm not a loser or a weirdo. I'm a person.

If you are into Youtube, FightMediocrity is a great channel relating to this stuff, crazy engaging concepts on confidence, connecting with people, how to be a man, and generally how to get the most out of life. Highly recommended! ",

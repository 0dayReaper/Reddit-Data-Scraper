            "comment": "All of campus is free parking on most weekends, but this weekend several lots are reserved due to family weekend. I will paste the email from our parking services\n\nAll day Friday:\nLot B (Visitors Lot) \nLot D (near Luter Hall) \n\nAll day Saturday:\nLot M (near Klich Alumni House)\nParking lots I, K, and L behind Potomac River and lot H (near the baseball field) will close at 10pm, Friday in preparation for the football game. Vehicles in lots I, K, L  and H must be moved by 10pm, Friday night or will be towed at the owner's expense. Lots will reopen at the conclusion of the game and vehicles must be moved back to their appropriate lots by 7:30 Monday morning.\n\nIf you are coming on Saturday, it is likely that your best bet will be the lot near the library, but just to be sure, if you call cnu parking services sometime during business hours this week they should be able to give you a more definite answer to help you avoid the ticket",

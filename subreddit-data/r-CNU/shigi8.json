Also, can you participate in both the honors program and the president\u2019s leadership program? Please let me know\ud83d\udc95",

You have to do an interview for it but they recommend you do an interview before or while applying anyway. Any yes you can do plp and honors but it\u2019s a lot of work to do both. Best of luck!",

If you think you can only get into honors just do honors since that's easier and has a bigger benefit than PLP, but if you don't think you can, go for both.",

I personally recommend it to make the most of your university life. The honors classes are a bit more interesting and intellectually diverse than most of the liberal arts curriculum they replace. So reach out to the director and talk to him about it! He's a genuinely kind and informative guy.",

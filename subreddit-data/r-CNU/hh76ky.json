Should I be worried ? Can I switch roommates if we don\u2019t along ? And if I can is it gonna be a really hard process ?",

Sometimes things don\u2019t work out, but you are more than likely to get someone who you have things in common with, primarily because it will be someone with the same or a similar major as you. If something does happen and you truly cannot live with them, there are steps you can take with your RA and hall director to move into a different space. :) Mostly everyone goes random at first! I only know maybe 2 or 3 people who actually sought after a roommate on Facebook/ GroupMe then ended up actually living with them.",

Honestly it can go either way and i found myself not to fond of either roommate. Sometimes random roommates can be a bad, sometime they can end up being your closest friends in later years.\nNow if you don\u2019t end up getting along with your roommate, as long as neither of you are in danger, your RA will try to mediate between you two. If that doesn\u2019t work you can be moved to another room but it usually takes awhile as rooms don\u2019t open up during the semester that often.",

It\u2019s all about communicating expectations, which you\u2019ll do with your RA in a roommate agreement. Heck having a random roommate could even open you up to experiences you hadn\u2019t thought of/done/had growing up.\n\nThat being said address any lifestyle problems in the living space promptly but respectfully. If that doesn\u2019t work reach out to your RA and they will guide you through the process. Usually a room change can cost a little bit of money but it\u2019s nothing huge, $50 IIRC",

Some like you a little less, some like you a little more. For me, I was in a suite of five, and two didn\u2019t care, one didn\u2019t like me and with one I got along so well that we\u2019re rooming again! So it\u2019s all around a neutral experience I\u2019d say. Respect eachother and you\u2019ll be fine.",

Just be honest and open with your roommate about your living style and preferences. If things are still strained and one of you would like to move, you can start that process in mid September ish (housing freeze for the first several weeks). Just don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re miserable to bring up issues, as open communication will save everyone involved a lot of stress.",

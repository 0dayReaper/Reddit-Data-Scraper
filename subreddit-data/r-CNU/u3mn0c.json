I saw the horror-story rant from 2 years ago on this sub, and was wondering if anyone could give a more updated opinion on what the CS program's like in general, if it's worth taking, if you would've gone somewhere else given the option, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMostly interested in the quality of the education but would love to hear advice/opinion on anything else too \\^\\^",

            "comment": "Honestly: the CS program at CNU is fine. Having family that went to VA Tech, you may find it easier to get into big tech companies with Tech on your resume, but the education doesn\u2019t vary much for CS (engineering of course may be a different story). GMU and ODU likely won\u2019t be any better or worse than CNU for CS.\n\nThat said, plenty of folks (myself included) managed to go from CNU to west coast big tech fine. If you\u2019re curious for more info, feel free to DM and I can provide more details, or email some folks from the PCSE department (they\u2019ll be more than happy to respond and you can find professor emails at https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/people/).\n\nI personally loved my time at CNU, and have 0 regrets about it from a career perspective.",

I did do a decent amount of stuff on my own (side projects + learnings), but nothing specific to CNU in that regard.\n\nI did do internships at CNU and managed to find ones in my area of interest (spent a summer prototyping with Google Glass for a company in the area), and I know of folks who are now doing internships in big tech since those connections have been made for the university now.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly pretty flexible and just depends on what you want. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "CNU's CS program is an average program, but it's more about what you get out of it. If you do the bare minimum and graduate, you got an average degree that will help you get the average job. If you put forth the effort and participate in the programs they offer outside of class, you're going to make more connections and get more opportunities. You're going to learn the basic skills that you will use everyday and help you land a job. \n\nI enjoyed my time at CNU, I didn't participate in the extra programs for the PCSE department, so I got the average education experience from it. With that said, it helped me get into the door with my first job, where you learn 100x more with on the job training and hours of doing the actual work. School laid that foundation for me. \n\nGo to the school you feel most comfortable at and CAN afford. Don't get so caught up in the big names, most jobs just want a degree to prove you are trainable and competent enough.",

            "comment": "I'm a sophomore at CNU right now. It's an alrigjt program. Obviously CNU is a liberal arts college so it's not super focused on those fields and you'll get a better education at VTech which is more focued on those fields. That's not to say it's horrible, I think it's alright so far and CNU has partnerships with NASA and Canon Virginia which can be beneficial for CS majors. They're also planning on building a building specifically for engineering and computer science and all those fields which you might be there to see. So they're definitely putting more focus on it, they're just in the process of it right now, so it isn't there yet.\n\nMy decision to go to CNU wasn't just cause of the major tho, it's also cause of location and campus life and the price as you talked about. So you also should definitely look into that as well.",

As for the location and campus life, I haven't given those much thought, just cause I'm not sure any difference in campus life justifies the tens of thousands of dollars more I'd be paying to go somewhere else. Dunno if that's shortsighted of me tho",

CNU maybe the cheapest option but have you looked if they have a sold grad program for CS? VT is pretty limited being in Blacksburg and Hampton Roads isn\u2019t really experience exponential growth compared to Nova.\n\nDo you prefer small college culture? CNU is small thus more rigorous and you\u2019d have to maintain a higher standing than the 3 bigger universities.",

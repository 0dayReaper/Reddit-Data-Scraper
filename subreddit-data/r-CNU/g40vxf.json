Is there a lot that goes on here (school events, parties etc.)? Also, in your experience, how hard or easy has it been to make friends at CNU? Any information about these factors and your experiences with them is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Tbh, theres always something going on on campus and although you cant rush as a first semester, its probably not hard to get into a party or two, though that wasn\u2019t my scene so I don\u2019t really have much data on that. Honestly though, making friends its weirdly easy. Just put yourself out there and you\u2019ll find people. It might take a bit to find the people who stick, but you generally will. Any more questions, feel free to ask.",

I don\u2019t go to parties anymore. If you\u2019re looking for other things to do, there\u2019s lots of clubs that are always looking for new members. Lots of really fun stuff to do on campus, and if you\u2019re willing to drive; there\u2019s some cool things around it. \n\nBecause it\u2019s a small school, it\u2019s pretty easy to make friends, especially at clubs and other activities.\nSo again, there\u2019s a lot to do on campus in regards to clubs and student oriented activities, but if you want to go to a school with big frat parties, definitely look elsewhere",

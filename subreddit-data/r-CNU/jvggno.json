    "postText": "Hey folks, so I've never requested an override before now and I've got a few questions. For context, I am a senior in the MAT program. Due to contradictory messages from the registrar's office and the graduate studies office, I did not register for a geography class that is a prerequisite for my MAT track. I don't know if it is important, but said class will be online. I wanna know how long it takes for override requests to be processed and the general success rate of them. Thanks!",

That will likely increase your success rate\n From my understanding most of it depends on the department chair approving the request. After that submit it via CNU live. At best it should take only a day or two to be processed.",

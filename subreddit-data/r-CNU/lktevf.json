    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI applied to CNU regular decision so I won\u2019t hear back until March 15 but it is one of my top two schools. I wanna major in political science but I haven\u2019t heard much about internship opportunities. I was wondering whether or not professors at CNU are well-connected in their field and help students get internships. I don\u2019t know much about the internship process but any information regarding internships within this field would be helpful!!",

            "comment": "If you're looking to intern for local politicians, great!\n\nOtherwise, there really isn't anything. Even the Center for Career Planning doesn't have much - the director just suggest that's PoliSci majors do stuff like social media coordination, or marketing, etc.\n\nI graduated from CNU in 2019 as a Political Science major, and tbh, CNU doesn't really give a flying fuck about the PoliSci majors.\n\nOverall, as an undergrad Poli Sci student, you'll basically just get internship opportunities with local politicians, and occasionally there are some opportunities in D.C., but generally those require that you be able to live in the NOVA area somewhere to commute in, otherwise those are also kind off the table.\n\nIn the end, I think it wholly depends on what you're looking to do with a B.A. in Political Science. Do you want to continue on to get a Ph.D in Political Science? Do you want to get into political policy analysis? Do you want to go to Law School? (Pro tip: if it's this latter one, being a Poli Sci major doesn't really help you. Law schools don't care what your major is for undergrad)",

By that I mean are they well-engaged in their field and if I formed good relationships with them could they potentially connect me to people that I wouldn\u2019t be connected to otherwise? \n\nIf you had had the opportunity to do your undergrad in polisci elsewhere, would you?",

I was basically told my options (if wanting to pursue IR), the best bet was to either get a master's in international relations/policy analysis and work in the peace corps.\n\nSome of the professors are great - Camobreco, Chaudhry, Kirkpatrick, Busch, and Greenlee (they are all personal favorites of mine)\n\nChaudhry is the Director of the Rieff Center for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution. She would be your best bet, I think, based on your interests. Kirkpatrick would also be a great professor to make connections with.\n\nNow could you make these connections at another college? Probably. Every college isn't going to be \"unique\" in who you can connect with, and you need to take into account other aspects of the college experience - what class size do you want? What kind of activities do you want to be involved in on campus? etc.\n\nIf I had the opportunity to do my undergrad in Poli Sci elsewhere, I may have gone somewhere else. Ultimately, I love CNU, despite some of its pitfalls.",

If I end up going I\u2019ll definitely look out for those professors!! \n\nI really liked the small class sizes at CNU and the campus felt cozy and friendly when I visited so that\u2019s also something I\u2019m keeping in mind. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m going to pursue my master\u2019s degree elsewhere and at a school that is well known for its IR school (hopefully). \n\nAgain thank you for your insight I found it very helpful!!",

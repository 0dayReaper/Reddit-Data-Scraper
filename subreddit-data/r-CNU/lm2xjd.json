    "postText": "So I received a parking ticket today for parking in a residence hall lot without having a decal. On the back of the citation, it says \"if the citation is noted No Valid CNU Decal you are eligible for dismissal\". So with that being said, I'm not sure if this is a warning or if I still have to pay the $20 fine.",

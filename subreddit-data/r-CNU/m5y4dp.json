    "postText": "Rising Junior here. Roommate and I are considering housing for next year and there isn\u2019t a whole lot of information being offered online on these two residences.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that since Rapp is still considered a residence hall that all the same main campus rules still apply, so has to be dry and there\u2019s FDA\u2019s and RA\u2019s, where as East Campus there\u2019s no FDA\u2019s but there are RA\u2019s and the rules are a bit more relaxed concerning alcohol (for 21+ of course) and guests. Just wondering if these are true. \n\nAdditionally if someone could help explain leases how we go about selecting them or if we even need one. What are the differences in cost between the two residences or are they the same as normal housing?\n\nI imagine and have heard the amenities and layouts of each are similar but is one more updated/nicer than the other? Larger spaces?\n\nWhich is harder to get into?",

            "comment": "I lived in Rapp for a year - there are no FDAs, only RAs.\n\nTechnically speaking, CNU is a dry campus, so alcohol is not allowed in any of the residence halls, even if you are of age to drink. That being said, if you're not stupid with it, you can pretty easily bring in alcohol as long as you hide for inspections.\n\nRapp is just a 12 month lease, whereas East Campus has buildings that are 12 month, and buildings that are 10 month.\n\nHonestly, I specifically chose Rapp because I wanted a nicer apartment with a year-round lease. However, it is much more expensive than living on East.\n\nWith East, the apartments aren't as nice as Rapp, and if you have a 10 month lease, even if you renew your lease, you have to move out your stuff at the end of the lease and move it back in a few months later.\n\nThe options, from cheapest to most expensive, goes: 10 month east campus, 12 month east campus, Rapp.\n\nThe 10 month leases are the hardest to get into, if I remember correctly. Most people don't want the 12, because they'd rather go home for the summer than stay in the apartment on campus. \n\nYes, you do need a lease. You don't exactly pick your lease directly. You pick what building you want to be in, which from there determines your lease. Rapp is automatically a 12 month lease. On East, however, CNU rotates which buildings are designated as 12 month or 10 month.\n\nUltimately, what you choose comes down to a few things:\n\n1) Are you supporting yourself through college? (Taking out federal loans, getting state grants, not relying on parents)\n\nIf so, East campus will probably be better for your pocket, unless you opt to not have a meal plan, in which case, you can get by living in Rapp as far as financial aid goes.\n\n2) Do you actually want to live in the apartment year round?\n\nThis doesn't particularly change things, since 90%+ students just go home for the summer and essentially waste the money they spent to have the apt year round, but you should consider it\n\n3) How many roommates do you have?\n\nEach building has different apartment sizes, as far as how many people can live in one apartment, so you need to take that into consideration.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nYou can definitely find information on Rapp and East if you go digging around on CNU's website, but you do need to be signed into the website in order to see it. I'm not sure anymore how to find it, but it is possible. You could also email housing to get this information.",

            "comment": "I got both a CS and CE major for my degree at CNU. The program offers a very practical approach to Engineering. There's a wide variety of courses you can take, but it won't be easy. If you like delving into specific courses and you don't really like dabbling in a lot of theory-based knowledge, then CNU is probably for you. A lot of the courses also pair themselves with extracurricular activities and the professors encourage you to get involved in those clubs. The course work not only overlaps, but some activities within clubs can be used as extra credit in your coursework.",

I knew Dr. Reidl very well as well as Clair and a lot of the other faculty. So the sheer Social Capital I had coupled with my reputation got me in a situation where companies were actually sending me job offers without me requesting interviews. The job market for engineers is direly under-supplied. If you get above a 3.0 GPA, there's no doubt you'll be able to succeed in finding a job. The real question becomes: What do you want your starting salary to be?",

I am a Psych/IS double major at cnu and I have friends who go to mason, tech, and William and Mary who are all doing cs, and so far I\u2019ve heard the least complaints from CNU and Mason. William and Mary seems to be good, but not exactly a safety school. Tech seems to have the steepest learning curve, but thats what you\u2019d expect there. UVA, from what I understand, has basically a pure luck system for getting into their engineering school. But yeah, I\u2019ve had a good time in the CNU CS department, and I\u2019ve heard similar things about Mason, although I have also heard horror stories from everywhere, so I\u2019m sure theres an element of luck in everything. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Whats your GPA, school district, etc?",

Unfortunately, I don't have an SAT score due to the cancelled dates, so I'm trying to take the exam in August/September. Honestly, I'm worried that I may not get into VTech / UVA since I heard that their engineering schools are very competitive. This year, for instance, I heard that many people got waitlisted by VTech. So, I'm trying to have some backups for CS programs. Also, I'm kinda hesitant on Mason since the school is very close to home, and I heard that there isn't a great college experience (which I'd like to go through). Regarding your friends at William and Mary, how has their experience been with the CS program and campus? I have that college on my list, but I'm not sure if I should apply there.",

Thats why I didn\u2019t go to mason. 4.85 is absolutely bonkers and fairfax has taught us that we aren\u2019t as good as we are. 4.85 gets into tech easy, especially if you have the IB credits. UVA is still kinda luck based from what I understand for engineering, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be an easy choice. Honestly, CNU and Mason are absolutely safety schools for you and you shouldn\u2019t worry about it. Just under NO CIRCUMSTANCE should you go to mary washington.

Definitely most of the competition from fairfax county kids is other fairfax county kids, what with quotas and all. I also cannot explain just how absolutely insane a 4.85 is and that even a 4.3 would be enough to get into pretty much any virginia school with even a single extracurricular. Honestly, I know its pricy, but for cs with stats like that, have you considered looking out of state? I\u2019d be willing to bet within the next year you could get some juicy scholarships in mass or cali. Maybe even try for Georgia Tech to be honest. Do you have any clubs or anything?",

I would say, since you have time, start looking into out of state schools. Theres genuine chance for full ride or close to it if you start farming the money now. I got like 27,000 in scholarships for college from writing a total of two essays. With your gpa and clubs and such, you\u2019ll likely be a genuinely hot commodity. I wouldn\u2019t rule them out completely. Try looking into some schools like Florida Polytech and such, smaller schools and sometimes even private schools will pay for you because they have much harder numbers they gotta hit",

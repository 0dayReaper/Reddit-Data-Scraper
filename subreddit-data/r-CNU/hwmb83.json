Trible has always been the type to wait to the last minute, or to try to push for staying open when it would make more sense to close (I remember one year I was there, it snowed really bad and the city basically shut down and he had a private plowing company running up and down the campus for hours, refusing to cancel classes. Most classes canceled anyway bc professors couldn't get to the school). I think once he realizes it will hurt the school's reputation to remain open, he'll change his mind.",

Sadly, those options are not available due to personal reasons. And I have to be honest with this cold, hard fact- if nothing changes with the campus reopening, such as going back to Phase 2 or switching back to online, that place is going to become a death trap. Especially the dorm rooms. Those waivers the university is planning on sending? They *do not* guarantee the safety of both the students and faculty. It only ensures the university that they would not be sued by families of the students and faculty.\n\nHad spent the last month, convincing the higher-ups on giving the students full option flexibility on the class method, online or HyFlex, that they would feel comfortable with. Unfortunately, that idea proposal has partially fell on deaf ears. Sure, we are all dealing with the uncertainty of how things should move forward. But placing everyone's lives on the virus chopping block is not the way to go. Right now I can only hope for everyone's sake, regardless if they care or not, that something changes before it is too late.",

I\u2019m a student with a disability, and I already deal with so many issues with professors not taking my accommodations seriously. I\u2019m horrified by the prospect of having to individually establish some method of remote learning with all of my professors. It shouldn\u2019t be like that.",

They are being instructed to be VERY lenient with student absences, especially for students with disabilities or accommodations. Plus, they all should have a game plan on uploading lecture materials to scholar so that students who miss class can keep up.",

What's most ridiculous, is the fact that the university has received funds to continue designing HyFlex almost a year ago, and yet they are only having a small number of classes be selected for that. They have no excuse to limit the number of classes for that opportunity of protecting students and faculty. What disgusts me even more are the actions of denying students to transfer to another college/university that offer the online flexibility.\n\nAs a fellow student with a disability, and having pre-diagnosed medical conditions that makes me extremely vulnerable to the virus, I can only hope that the possibilities of the VA state going back to Phase 2, the roaring outcry of the student and Hampton communities, or the last min decision of switching to online teaching, will turn the tides in terms of safety for our families and each other. One thing's for sure, I hate sitting around and wait for something to happen",

My father, who is a CNU alumi, stepped in and sent emails out to Trible, VA state senators, news outlets- the whole nine yards- just to get things moving with reconsidering changing the reopening plans. Even though the only thing we can do now is to wait, I wish something else came into play that may give the students and faculty the upper hand on switching to online teaching.",

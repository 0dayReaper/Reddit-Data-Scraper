There\u2019s a few things with walking distance of campus but after freshmen year you\u2019ll be able to see pretty much everything. However, you\u2019re pretty close to VA Beach, Williamsburg, and Bush Gardens so if you have a ride, there\u2019s a lot to do just OUTSIDE Newport News.",

On warm days when you don't wanna drive super far, CNU students often hang out at Buckroe Beach or Huntington Beach, which are on the peninsula. Or sometimes Yorktown Beach which is near Williamsburg",

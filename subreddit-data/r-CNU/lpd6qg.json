The professor that handles the security classes is great, and does a good job of it - but it's just not a good choice if you want to work in cybersecurity Most of getting employed in this field is doing work outside of the standard boundaries of collegiate education, and a lot of cybersecurity degrees leave students disadvantaged skills-wise compared to more traditional computer related degrees. A CS major with a security minor would look very well, though. I work in the field full time, feel free to DM me any questions you have.",

I believe it started as a major in the Fall of 2019.\n\nEdit:\n\nLooking at the course catalog, there are only 3 classes that are actually cybersecurity. The rest of the courses for the major are either math, physics, or comp sci.",

If there are any Christians on this sub please tell me your experiences and which ministry was the best ministry for you to join and why you chose it? Thank you guys so much!\n\nEDIT: a word",

I always thought  naming yourself after one of the worst parts of the religion's history was a poor move, but whatever, I didn't join.\n\nThere are some good churches down there. Those are probably your best bet. All of them seem welcoming to college students.",

I really loved the community - we were friends outside of small group, and large group was a great way to get to meet people every week. As far as churches go, check out Coastal Community Church. A lot of students from CRU and IV go there, and they also have small groups held on campus in the Library or in Panera on east ",

When we got there at our time, they hadnt reserved a table for our group (meaning we had a 45 minute wait minimum). So, I abandoned the reservation and decided to have it at Mellow Mushroom. The service was excellent, they have a good variety of shots/beers and the food was perfect. \n\nTL:DR - Mellow Mushroom. Avoid BJ's at all costs. ",

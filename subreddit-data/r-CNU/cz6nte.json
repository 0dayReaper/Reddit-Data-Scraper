    "postText": "I am a senior this year and I still vote absentee. I saw another organization on campus today asking for people\u2019s information to register them to vote in Newport News. I am always concerned because these are private organizations asking for a lot of your information including your ssn. What are peoples thoughts on giving private info to these types of organizations?",

I know from volunteering for a school board candidate that candidates can access your contact info to make calls anyway but I still don't like the idea of a private organization having access to poll me or whatever.",

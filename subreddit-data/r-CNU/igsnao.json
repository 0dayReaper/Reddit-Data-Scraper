I haven't seen Regs or Commons during the lunch rush, but they look to be pretty much as safe as they can be. They limited indoor seating a lot and only have tables for two, with the seats being like 6ft apart even at the same table.\n\nRegs is a bit confusing and hard to navigate compared to Commons, but if people can keep a distance it'll probably be safer.\n\nMasks are basically required everywhere and while I haven't seen anyone enforce it outside (inside they are pretty good about enforcing it) most of the students seem to be taking the requirement seriously.\n\nBefore coming down I assumed we'd be leaving in a week, and CNU was just collecting that 40% room and board fee. Now that I'm down here I'm a bit more hopeful that if we can avoid excessive partying we might make it for a bit longer than a week.\n\nI could also be completely wrong and we're going home tomorrow, idk.",

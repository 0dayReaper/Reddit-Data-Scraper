    "postText": "So I am going to be a freshman at CNU next year, and I was wondering if anyone knew how good CNU's jobs are for students or like how much they pay. I currently work at Food Lion and make $8.46 an hour. They have the option of transferring to a Food Lion at Newport News. Idk if I should do that or take a leave of absence and work an on-campus job. I do want to make money while there though, so any advice would help.",

Contact the Center for Career Planning and ask about on campus job opportunities and start looking through the online catalogue of jobs on Handshake. The Center for Career Planning will be able to tell you more!\n\nThere\u2019s also opportunities in different departments to get paid to do undergraduate research, so talk to your department chair and see what you can find!\n\nI know of several students who have been involved in undergrad research all four years!",

            "comment": "afaik best-paying student job at CNU is tutoring @ $10/hr, but you're only guaranteed hours so long as students show up for tutoring (I did direct scheduling which worked like this, but others had drop-in hours which I think worked a little different). ofc, you won't likely get a tutoring job until sophomore year at the earliest, since you need to justify some background expertise in whatever subject you're tutoring for (e.g. having taken the relevant intro/100-level classes). It's a good gig though, if you can work your way into it.  \n\n\nYou mentioned in another reply about jobs that might help your studies: I'm not positive about what jobs would benefit your studies best, but working in Interlibrary Loan helped me learn database navigation skills much more quickly than I would have normally, which helped for researching/writing papers. That was only \\~$7.75/hr iirc. Best of luck, whatever you do decide!",

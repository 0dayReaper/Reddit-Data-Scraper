    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a college student and writer for College Magazine (925,000 monthly readers). I\u2019m writing an article ranking the ten best colleges in Virginia. I\u2019m looking for student quotes supporting why each college should be considered one of the best. I would really appreciate if at least one or two of you could message me to answer the following:\n\n1. Give a short review in 2-5 sentences explaining what you like about your school (though feel free to mention a negative) (things to consider: Is there stuff to do on and off campus? How are the classes? Did it meet your expectations?, etc.)\n2. Did you study abroad? If so, was it a good experience and did the school have a lot of options and a smooth process for completing it? (it\u2019s okay to ignore this question if you didn\u2019t study abroad)\n3. your name (first and last), major, and year of graduation.\n\nYou can either DM me or email me at [blasbergj@gmail.com](mailto:blasbergj@gmail.com), and I\u2019ll make sure to send you the article with your quote in it!",

            "comment": "&gt; This was back when people still had a sense of right and wrong, and America was still ( at least culturally) a Christian nation. They knew homosexuality was a mental illness. Today, no major TV station would air this because it would be viewed as \"intolerant\" and \"bigoted.\" As a young Paleoconservative guy, it pains me to see how America has declined in the last 66 years.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/paleoconservative/comments/4ovroe/1950s_public_service_annoucement_on_homosexuality/)\n\n&gt; I have dreams of buying a house in an affluent suburb one day. If HUD puts poor housing into every suburb, that dream will be ruined. There will be no point in living I in the suburbs. America will become a dump.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/47bgaf/what_has_donald_said_about_hud/)\n\n&gt; I'm a devout Christian, and a pretty conservative guy, so please don't give me Progressive/Marxist authors.( I don't want authors that have gay characters in every book like Ken Follett does)\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/4nnzkw/need_to_create_a_reading_list/)\n\n&gt; I thought HSC was a preppy, conservative \" good ole boys' school. Are those days over? When I visited HSC a few months ago, I was very impressed with the school. I thought it'd be a great fit for me. I need honest answers. Is HSC trying to get rid of its old reputation? Is it becoming a Liberal school? If this is the case, I don't want to attend. I want to attend a school where preppy conservatives are the majority.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/hsc/comments/4mtu9i/is_hsc_still_conservative/)\n\n&gt; As I said I'm of the Far-Right, and I'm probably the most politically incorrect guy ever. I'm also very traditional in dress and manners. If I attend Reed, the only thing you'll ever see me in is a jacket and tie.( with khakis and penny loafers) Are Reedies up for a challenge from someone whose the exact opposite of what they are? I will NOT be told to shut up because of my views, and I will NOT tolerate professors giving me bad grades due to my views.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/reedcollege/comments/4oowj5/questions_about_reed/)\n\n&gt;  I want to be around students who are devout in their faith. I want to AVOID things like fornication and sodomy. I want a school where the girls are chaste.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillsdale/comments/4f80ao/is_the_student_body_at_hillsdale_religious/)\n\nCNU would not suit you. CNU is more diverse and shares far more varied social, political, and religious views than you would evidently be comfortable with. The things you are basing your college decision on, like the \"preppyness\" and uniformity of conservatism, are incredibly daft and will only be helpful if you want to continue existing in the world your parents have constructed for you thus far in your life.\n\nEdit: formatting",

CNU is not racially diverse in the least, which is what most people think of when they read diverse in my experience. We are definitely politically diverse, but racially, the vast majority of us are white. The 2015 Freshman class 73% white.

What I'm optimistic about in that regard is that, for the most part, students are embarrassed by that number and unhappy because it doesn't represent the type of community we want to have. A lot of people I've heard from really want to work harder to improve that situation (involvement with SDEC being a great example), but a lot of people just aren't sure how to approach it. I think that's a conversation that definitely needs to be had on a school-wide level. With that said, I do believe that CNU is diverse in many other ways. Some of the things I love about it is that there aren't cliques where you're either in or out, and many people are open to new ideas and hearing from different backgrounds. Anyway, there's definitely more work to do because I'm disgusted by that percentage.\n\nThanks for the source - had not seen that before.",

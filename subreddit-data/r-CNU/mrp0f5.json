It's writing intensive that focuses on how to structure the kind of things you'd write in a professional setting. Examples in the course description are \"memos, letters, proposals, abstracts, reports, resumes...\"\n\nI'm not sure if I'm going to take it because it sounds extremely boring, but it might also be our best option for something that would help us in our career.",

The writing component is essentially one ~15 page paper, which isn\u2019t too much considering you usually have most of the day free if you\u2019re only taking one class during Maymester. You spend half of the class in lectures about philosophy topics, and then watch movies pertaining to those topics the next class.",

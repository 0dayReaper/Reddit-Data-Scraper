Unfortunately we are dumb and didn\u2019t realize that sign ups were actually available for April... we just didn\u2019t see the scroll button. Since we just discovered this all the slots are filled, but this is the only day we really have to visit the campus. \n\nSo can any of you guys give us some places to hit for our own self guided tour? Are we even allowed to do that? Thank you in advance!",

Honestly, as long as you wear your mask and follow CNU's guidelines, no one will give you a hard time for being on campus. Up to you, but I've seen plenty of people on campus that don't go here and no one messed with them lol.\n\nYou could also call whoever is in charge of the tours and see if they can squeeze you into a tour. I doubt they would turn away potential students. \n\nIf you end up being able to come check out campus, I recommend walking all around the great lawn, it's just a big rectangle-- easy to follow! Also, make sure you park in the right lot so you don't get a ticket. Good luck!",

If a door opens, explore! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake sure to be masked up, however. CNU likes to come off as covid cautious",

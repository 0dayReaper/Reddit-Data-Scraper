    "postText": "I'm panicking. I recently committed to VCU, but I seriously am re- considering going there in favor of CNU. From what I've gathered from among my peers, my counselors, and my teachers CNU seems to have more promise, academically, than VCU does. I just don't know that withdrawing my commitment and committing to CNU is a smart decision. Students (and Alumni) of CNU, what is unique about CNU? Does the reputation of CNU as having good academic programs overall hold up? PLEASE HELP ME.\n\nEDIT: I'd just like to say thank you for all your help. I really appreciate how responsive you guys were. I paid the deposit last night and am officially going to Christopher Newport University for the class of 2020 entering in the fall! (:",

            "comment": "The CS department at CNU has professors who are very good in their field and are incredibly smart, but they are not the best teachers. They can help you one-on-one and have very good connections (the creator of XKCD went to CNU), but the class lectures leave something to be desired. That being said, the math department is incredibly strong, as is the business school. If you can, take a day to visit both schools before the school year is over and sit in on a class at each. No professor would mind, and you can get a sense for what each is like.",

I know we have an excellent CS, Math and Psych/Neuro department, so if you are interested in anything related to that I would highly suggest coming here.\n\nThe professors are all very welcoming and I've made good friends with a few, something I probably couldn't have done that a bigger school. The opportunities they have given me in terms of research labs and experience have made CNU a great choice for me. \n\nAs for non-academics, CNU kinda sucks in terms of parties compared to big schools. It's all about finding your group of friends to hang out with. Greek life is huge here due to our small size and many more people join it comparatively to other schools. \n\nThe city itself is honestly pretty shit. There's not much to do, with the exception of the Oyster Point city center, and a few others. But we are close to the beach, and have a few nice outdoorsy areas. \n\nI hope this helps!\n",

If you know you want to do business, you have to start taking pre-requisites for the business school your first semester. So, if you don't know about doing business yet, and you don't want to spend more than 4 years at college, that's going to be a tough choice.\n\nCNU is a great school for a lot of majors. That's one of the appeals of going there. Small class sizes start your freshman year.\n\nGreek life exists. I wasn't part of it, and if I had to do it all over again, I still wouldn't join. I had friends in Greek life, and I heard a lot of complaining from them about their respective fraternities and sororities. But, if it's something you're considering, it's available. \n\nI wasn't a big partier, and honestly the lack of an on campus party scene was attractive to me. I would rather hangout with a few friends than 30+ acquaintances anyway. I did drink on and off campus. It's only a dry campus if you're stupid and get caught. I did live off campus my last year, and enjoyed the freedom of not having to smuggle beer into my apartment. \n\nHowever, living on campus at CNU is actually a big bonus. They offer you housing all 4 years you're there if you want it. And it is really nice housing (and always getting better). VCU does not guarantee housing except your freshman year (or that's how it was when I was applying to schools).\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Newport News area, it's a lot of strip malls. That being said, there are plenty of off campus things to do in the immediate area, especially if you have a car, which CNU lets you have freshmen year. Some things that come to mind are Busch Gardens, the beach, hiking the Noland, art museums, block parties (once you're old enough).\n\nGood luck. You'll probably be happy at either school.",

But you do find your niche of people most of the time. There\u2019s not a lot of overt racism on campus outside of potentially one event. There a couple trashy subtly racist folks at the college for few but every college has them. They\u2019re getting fewer and further between too. The campus is supposedly making efforts to diversity in their admissions process so that\u2019s another plus. There also a decent bit of organizations for minorities (exclusive to one race or inclusive to all) such as the Black Student Union, Hispanic Student Org, Campus Diversity Council, and a few others ",

Outside of the athletes the student body felt 95% white. \n\nIt\u2019s a good environment but if diversity is something you value this is worth considering. \n\nThis was also pre Trump, when racists weren\u2019t as proud to be racists...",

    "postText": "Hey yall! I'm a freshman that just moved into their dorm. I've got most of my devices connected to the WiFi but one-- a TV. Unfortunately my ethernet cable isn't long enough to connect, so I hoped that I could use the WiFi. However, no matter how many times I put in the password I used for my phone and computer (the one for CNU Live), it doesn't work. Has anyone had a similar problem, and can anyone think of another password that might work?",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, if it\u2019s a smart tv, Ethernet will be the only way to use the WiFi. CNU wifi requires you to be able to log on using both your username and password, and most TVs do not have that. Target and Walmart have some 14-16 foot long cables that should work! If you\u2019re trying to use a Nintendo Switch or other console/ attachment without an Ethernet port, amazon has some adapters that are USB male-&gt;Ethernet female so you can hook it up. Hope this helps!",

Your best option is to probably just get your own router and plug it into an Ethernet outlet. These are technically not allowed, but I\u2019ve never heard of anyone getting in trouble for one. Just unplug it and put it away during room inspections.",

Connect your laptop to the WiFi then you can set your computer to share the WiFi connection with the ethernet port on the laptop. Then you can run the ethernet from your laptop to whatever you are trying to connect",

    "postText": "Any advice on how to find friends as a transfer commuter student? All i come to campus for are my classes, and then i leave. I\u2019d love to stick around and study with friends, but I literally have none!! What\u2019s the best way to meet new people? I missed the involvement fair, so I\u2019m not sure how to join anything.",

I've noticed that because of covid, a lot of people are just hanging around on the great lawn, like more than usual. If you're ever free on like a friday evening, I'm sure there'd be a ton of people! Whether they're sober or not is a different story, but nonetheless a lot of people.\n\nOther than that, this [site](https://thecompass.cnu.edu/) shows every CNU club! You can find organizations you might be interested in and email the president of the club from there!\n\nMy only other idea is attempting to socialize more in class, although that's not really too possible...\n\nI'm sure you'll be able to find some friends though! :)",

I have found some info on the [Emotional Support Animal Policy  documentation](https://cnu.edu/public/policies/policy/student-services-policies/cnu-policy-9040_emotional_support_animal.pdf) but I'm not sure exactly what I need to do. I've also found the  [Request for Accommodation Form](https://cnu.edu/life/disability/_pdf/cnu-form-dssrequestform.pdf) on the [Disability Support](https://cnu.edu/life/disability/) website. Do I use this form to make an ESA request?  \n\n\nIf anyone has successfully requested an emotional support animal and has any advice that would really help me a lot! Thanks!",

It's grown so much since it started so I'm not sure of the negative reviews are just old what.\n\nIs the positive picture that the school paints a relatively accurate depiction of the school?",

I can only speak for the English department (transferred from a community college, so I only took maybe 3 classes outside my field). \n\nCNU was a great school for me, I found all the professors knowledgeable and engaging. I had no issues with other school staff I interacted with while there. The professors really are the best part of the school though - I didn't encounter a single one who wasn't willing to help a student understand something they were struggling with.\n\nFor anything more in depth, it would be helpful to know what it is you're looking for in a university.",

            "comment": "I suppose CNU as a choice depends on what you are looking to get out of your college experience. \n\nI personally chose CNU because of the low class sizes. That\u2019s just how I learn best. You aren\u2019t taught by a TA while sitting in a room of 300 people. All classes are taught directly by the professors in at most 30 people (though some required courses do have you in classes of 75-100 but there\u2019s not many of these) and you get to know them. Most of the time they are actually great people and do genuinely care about the subject they are teaching. \n\nCNU is not really a party school. It\u2019s a dry campus so no alcohol is allowed in the dorms. Most of the big fraternities and sororities are academic based. They also push you towards doing some community service (but it\u2019s not required, I haven\u2019t done any through the school).\n\nIt is a small campus. Everything is pretty much in a 5-10 minute walking distance from the main campus dorms. I can leave my room 10 minutes before a class and still get there on time. \nAs someone mentioned, some of the administration choices are a bit infuriating, but they have done pretty well in handling Covid. Strong mask requirement, desks in classrooms are distanced and sanitation wipes are provided to wipe them down too.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a lot of constant campus activities (not so much recently because you know... pandemic and all), there\u2019s hundreds of clubs and sports so I mean I am sure you can find something that would match your interest. \n\nThe dining halls are kinda hit or Miss in my opinion. There\u2019s a changing menu while burgers, hotdogs, pizza, and grilled cheese are always options if you don\u2019t like what\u2019s on the main menu. I find myself liking it more than not liking it.\n\nJust a small look at campus life.",

It is very drawing in at first and after a while you kinda get used to it. \n\nIt\u2019s become a meme at this point at how many columns buildings have and how the grass is so green that it has to be painted. So they do a lot to make the campus look nice, which I mean I can\u2019t fault them for that. So it\u2019s more for show to draw people in than it is for actual use and purpose. \n\nStill overall a nice choice for a school, I don\u2019t regret my decision.",

Usually by the time I'm allowed to start signing up for those classes, all but one or two have been filled up, and I'm left with subpar options for the direction I want to take my degree once employed. Different departments might be better on this, and its clear the quality of the classes that already exist is high, but it really feels like there should be more than one section per subject for these high demand, high need courses.",

            "comment": "I transferred out after my freshman year. From my personal experience, here\u2019s the important things I\u2019ve taken away from it:\n\n- The professors are great, or at worst decent. I never had issues with classes in terms of difficulty or accessibility to instructors. Class sizes are pretty small.\n\n- You will not be a good culture fit if you don\u2019t join a student org. Greek life, CRU, band, sports and other student orgs have a HEAVY campus presence. They tell you this in orientation and it is very accurate. If orgs aren\u2019t your thing you will not get a lot out of campus culture.\n\n- Students were much more closed minded than I expected. A close friend of mine witnessed several instances where students made racist comments (by racist I mean using the N word, hard R in public). \n\n- The reputation and \u201creach\u201d of the school isn\u2019t worth the cost at $27k+ (more now?) tuition. Schools like GMU or Tech (even VCU/JMU) have a much bigger reputation/name recognition for employment prospects.\n\n- Major selection: it is very limited compared to other public universities. For example CNU has a couple of basic Comms major tracks (like PR) while GMU has several Comms concentrations (health comms, political comms, etc). The quality of education is lower in my mind because it is not as specialized as other schools. When I left, a faculty member was trying to get a pre law/legal studies track off the ground too. I know a big focus of CNU is their teaching track, so outside of that you probably wont be getting the best education in the area you want to study for the cost.\n\n- This seems small but it\u2019s actually a big thing- when I attended (dont know if it is different now) the meal plan was expensive and stingy. You get 2 dining \u201cguest\u201d passes per semester. If you have friends that visit often or a long distance partner who visits, you wont be able to go to the dining hall with them (obviously notwithstanding covid- this may not be an issue now).\n\nEDIT TO ADD: You also have to live on campus for 3-4 years. You can\u2019t move off campus until senior (?) year unless you have very specific circumstances. \n\nI hope this helps!",

When it came to things like application questions, financial aid help, or getting more information in general - they were very quick to respond and were very friendly (no roundabout emails or dodging questions) which was issues I've dealt with other schools before where they'd just say leave a voicemail or send a LONG email with random links for vague help/faqs, and this helped me in choosing the school.\n\nNow I've been a commuter since I live within the area and it just makes sense (especially with this pandemic), but the opinion also lies within your major! I'm in psychology with a few minors, but all the professors have been very friendly and warm so far (maybe one or two were a little hard to get close to but they were teaching a couple of classes containing 50+ students online at times). Same with the advisors and the students as well. Majority of people are friendly though to my surprise.\n\n(Sadly I can't give much info for on-campus things except that it looks very nice, I've been maybe 3 times - tour, welcome package, and research meeting since arriving 2020).\n\nWish you the best in your decisions!",

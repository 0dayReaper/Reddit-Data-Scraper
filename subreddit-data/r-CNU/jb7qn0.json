I\u2019m not doing well in one of my classes, and I was wondering if there is a way I can retake it next semester to get a better grade? \n\nWill both classes/grades be on your transcript? Will I have to retake the lab with the class even if I did well in it the first time?",

            "comment": "1) Yes you can retake for a better grade\n\n2) Yes, technically, both classes will show up on your official transcript, but for the purposes of CNU calculating your GPA, they'll only pay attention to the higher grade of the two. HOWEVER, if you plan on furthering your education past a bachelor's, some higher education takes into account both grades, not just the higher one of the two. Something to keep in mind.\n\n3) The lab and lecture are two different entities, so if you've done well in the lab, you don't have to retake it.",

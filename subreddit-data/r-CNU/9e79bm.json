The professors are wonderful, caring, and extremely respected in their fields. The department also has strong ties to a large number of employees in and around Virginia. From looking at the new course lists (a lot has changed in the 6 years I've been out) they've really expanded the program to make sure their graduates have a leg up in the working world. The 5 year Masters is also worth taking a look at if you think you may want an MS in Cs.Just one perspective, but I really did love my department! Best of luck with your decision!",

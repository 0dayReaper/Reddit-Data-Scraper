He shares an identity with you and I, a Captain, and makes the incident feel real and personal. At least it does for me. This was one of our own. This mindset and motivation to cause harm isn\u2019t happening in someone else\u2019s backyard, it\u2019s happening on the Great Lawn.",

I suppose sometimes the things we should fear the most are the friends we made along the way.",

Where they\u2019re from, who their family is, their religion, mental health history, where they went to school. I think that curiosity accomplished two things. \n\nFirst, it helps people piece together or understand what may (or may not have) have led them to violence. Was there anything about their home life, education, background that there may have been indicators that they would do something like this? Second, I think it humanizes people. It makes it feel not so far away and forces me to reflect even further on the people in my life.",

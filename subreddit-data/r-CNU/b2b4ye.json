If you do want to party, you will have to look a little bit, but you will be able to find one. I'm one year removed now, but parties used to happen at the Suites at Port Warwick Apartments (not the Warwick Dormitory) about 2-3 miles from campus, at greek housing and in the greek village. ",

Being in those orgs or having friends in them is an easy way to hear about them but its easy to find them even if that isn't the case. Most parties are held off campus but drinking in the dorms does happen pretty frequently (those are more just between groups of friends). Most off campus parties are held within a few blocks of campus so people can easily walk to it and walk home but there are sober drivers at most events + uber is cheap and used frequently. Some events are held a few miles from campus and do require getting rides to and from but again, its not to hard to find out about them and get to them.",

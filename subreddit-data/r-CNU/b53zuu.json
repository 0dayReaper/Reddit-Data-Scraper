    "postText": "So I'm leaning towards attending CNU this fall, the size of the school's really appealing and I've heard loads of good things about it, but the thing is I'm transgender and I can't find much about how accepting the environment is. I know there's an active LGBT+ group, but I was wondering about the student body as a whole, as well as how the school's policies are, especially since trans folks aren't a protected class in VA. Thank you! Also, I'm sorry this is similar to a couple other posts, but those ones were more about sexuality and there are plenty of people who accept one but not the other. Any help is appreciated!",

Also, the professors there really do take an interest in your college career and wellbeing which, in turn, makes the journey easier. I really enjoyed it there, I know you will too!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

He\u2019s a very loyal friend, so if either of those individuals had been treated disrespectfully, he would have been very upset about it and would most likely have vented about it to me - and I\u2019ve not heard even a hint of any issues.",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm currently on the Spectrum eboard so I can give you some more information about this. The CNU environment is very accepting, including non-LGBT people and the staff/faculty. We have personally been working with the school, especially the special assistant to the VP of diversity and inclusion. One of the nice things that you can now do is even if you haven't legally changed your name, and you have a preferred name, you can change your email display name through them. There are also gender neutral housing initiatives that are being worked on by us and some of the other on campus organizations, including the Residence Hall Association and the student assembly! The Greek life on campus is also pretty accepting, there are a few Greek organizations that have trans members (I personally know most of them). Overall, the environment towards LGBT people, especially trans people, is very accepting. From what I've heard from my trans friends, the professors and staff will definitely listen to you and adjust what they call you/your pronouns if you let them know!",

Many of the fraternities and sororities on campus also are very LGBT friendly and almost all have LGBT members. ",

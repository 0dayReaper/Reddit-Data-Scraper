    "postText": "So my friendo back home and I enjoy a wide range of co-op games on PS4, and had no problems until a few days ago when connection stopped working completely. I have an ethernet cable connected to the console, and going into the network info let me know that while the connection seems fine the actual NAT type is \u201c3\u201dwhich explicitly says will cause network restrictions between consoles. This leads me to believe CNU may have installed security restrictions or something? Either way neither of us can connect to each other\u2019s console or any games outside basic voice chat.",

I know of a few students who are working full time hours a few days a week at firms and having their classes be on off days (ex work MWF and have all classes TR). \n\nAlso there are extracurricular organizations like CFUND and Alpha Kappa Psi which would be extremely beneficial to join as a student looking to go into Finance.

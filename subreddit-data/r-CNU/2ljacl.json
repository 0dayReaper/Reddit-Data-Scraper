    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI've been spending a lot of time over the semester working out an idea for an app we could use on campus, and it's starting to come to completion. The idea is this: when the app gets installed on a user's phone, it can use the phone's GPS to determine if they're in one of the dining halls on campus (and also Einstein's). \n\nIf there are enough users, it'll get really accurate at telling you how many people are there and also how crowded it is. The location capabilities also allow people in the dining halls to post to a local feed about what's going on - maybe to give a heads up to others or whatever you want. Think a small Yik Yak only for the dining halls. You can also get the menu and all that good stuff.\n\nHere's the photos of development (android) at this point: http://imgur.com/a/DyxYx#0 - there's also an iPhone app.\n\nI'm going to be releasing this for free on both Android and iOS in the near future, but I need people (particularly those with an Android device) who might be interested in testing and debugging. If you're interested and willing to keep me updated with bug reports, please let me know! I'd also love to get feedback about what everyone thinks so I can make this thing sweet.",

However, if you're interested in helping feel free to PM me your email address and I'll put you on the list!",

You will need to have iOS8 in order to beta test, but when the actual app is released it'll be available for iOS 7+",

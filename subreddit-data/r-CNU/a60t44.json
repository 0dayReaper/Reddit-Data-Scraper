    "postText": "I transferred from a local community college and have found this place to be pompous and difficult only for the purpose to retain its preppy elitist reputation. The professors are intentionally vague during lecture for the purpose to push students to do their own research instead of teaching the material in class. The community college was so much more down to earth and it seemed the professors there really cared and wanted their students to succeed. Here it seems like the contrary is the standard. Perhaps it is just my molecular Bio program though.  Any thoughts?",

And as for pompous, I think it really depends on who you surround yourself with. This school costs a LOT of money and gravitates lots of people from NOVA, one of the most upper-class areas in the country, but there are still so many other people who are relatable and more genuine.\n\nFind your people! Join a club or an organization that celebrates something you're passionate about. Maybe even join a fraternity or sorority. It doesn't even have to be an IFC or Panhellenic, there are plenty of Greek orgs that do not align themselves into either one. I joined a co-ed fraternity and it was the best choice I made at CNU.",

In addition, it depends on which professors you get. You really have to do your research when picking your schedule and classes, there\u2019s only a handful of professors who are down to earth. ",

There were quite a few times when some of the professors headed over to Christopher's with us, and I was friends with several of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is like any other university: there are a lot of people here of all kinds. What works for me might not work for you. The main thing to do, regardless of who you end up taking classes with, is to communicate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy single biggest mistake when I was attending CNU was staying quiet or only talking to other students about my issues. The staff always treats students who participate in their education better than they do those who are \"just there\".",

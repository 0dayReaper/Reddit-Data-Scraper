    "postText": "While we're on the subject of Kutztown.... Does anyone know if the cave (not Crystal Cave) up in the woods is still open.  Many years ago I used to visit with some KU friends (KSC at the time- back them days) a cave that they all called \"Moose's Cave\".   It had a pretty big entrance, maybe 30\" and then a lotta crawl on your belly stuff, but there were some big caverns once you got deep.  The exit was called the corkscrew, you had to be a gymnast to wriggle out. \n\nIt was really fucking cool, and we camped overnight a few times inside.  Anyone know if this is still a thing?",

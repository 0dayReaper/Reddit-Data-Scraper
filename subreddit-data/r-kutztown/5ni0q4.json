I found that the professors at KU (in general) are all very invested in teaching and helping the students actually learn.  I went to grad school at a much bigger, research university, and I felt the professors there didn't give a shit about the students and only cared about themselves.\n\nThe languages, etc we used at KU were all outdated, but that doesn't really matter in the real world.  In fact, most times what you learn is school is outdated by the time you're finding a job.",

I actually feel like I'm learning something new and retaining that knowledge. The professors are knowledgeable and are always available for questions, either via email or during their office hours. \n\nThe main language they teach through the \"entry-level\" courses is C++, but I've also learned HTML, JavaScript, and Java among others. \n\nAll in all, it's a great program.

One of them is near Philly. Another did her master's and works in federal law enforcement in the area of cybersecurity (she was a criminal justice double major). Another was a math/CS double major and just took a civilian job with the Navy after working at a smaller company for a year or two. The latter two were better students than the first two, if that matters.",

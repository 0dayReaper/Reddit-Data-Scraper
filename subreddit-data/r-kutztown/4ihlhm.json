    "postText": "I'm thinking of transferring into Kutztown. What are some things I should know? How are the classes, food, dorms, etc? Also, how easy is it to meet people and what are the students like? What are some things to do? I'm coming from a small campus (buildings are 5-9 minutes from my dorm, which is on the far end of campus) with about 2000-3000 students. I plan to study video/digital media, and I'm going to try to have my car on campus.",

            "comment": "I transferred here my junior year. Personally, I wish I had done more research into other schools. The main reason I came here is because I had a few close friends that were going here at the time. Well, they are gone now and I really don't like it here. I've heard good things about the art departments, but I'm not an art major. My classes suck. They are super easy and I am not being properly prepared for a career. (computer science/math. Not that it matters. All the departments here besides the arts are terrible) As far as the food goes you have two options: ridiculously overpriced food or Chick-fil-a. The line for Chick-fil-a is wrapped around the building and outside at all meal times.\n\nAnyway, the dorms seem to be pretty nice. I've never lived on campus, but they seem cool from what I've seen. The nightlife here is lame... actually, lame doesn't even describe it. If you are looking to party go somewhere else. I'm serious.\n\nAll that negative stuff being said, it's not the worst place on Earth. People here are generally nice and there are some good places to eat in town.\n\nBasically, if you are coming here to be a hardcore dedicated art student, then this is a good school for you. Otherwise pretty much any school is better in almost every aspect.",

Clases vary by professor, like everywhere, but they do seem to have a good food selection. \nNever seen the dorms, all I have heard is that the smoke detectors are very sensitive.\nEveryone complains about parking but I don't think it's that's bad, as a commuter.",

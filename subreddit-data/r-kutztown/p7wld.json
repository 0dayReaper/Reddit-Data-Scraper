There are a couple of parks around that you could go to.  You could also go to the lehigh valley mall or the promenade if you want to shop or something.",

Lake Ontelaunee has some paths and trails through the forest, though it's nothing to write home about. It's still a nice get away from the day to day drag.  \n\nCrystal Cave is open at the beginning of March, so next month you should definitely check that out! It's a unique experience, and I highly recommend you check it out. If you venture out towards Hamburg, right next to Cabella's is a stretch of the Appalachian trail...it goes without saying that this is worth checking out.  \n\nA great place to eat, is the new Chinese buffet that they just built up next to the Weis, at least, I think it's a Weis. Either way, hands down the best buffet I've been to (and I've eaten Chinese in a large number of the 50 states). It's a bit tricky, because it's right next to a Chinese carry out place, but the buffet is where it's at. You won't be disappointed. \n\nIf tattoos are your thing, Lucky 13 tattoos on Main Street is the place to go. I've gotten most of my work done there, and James is a great artist. Very reasonably priced for the quality of work you'll get.  \n\nAnything else just ask!",

I don't always drink, but when I do, I go there.",

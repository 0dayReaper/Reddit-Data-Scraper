            "comment": "- The dorms vary. The older dorms (Bonner, Johnson, Lehigh, Schuylkill, Berks, Deatrick, and Rothermel) are all pretty similar in size and are basically stereotypical dorm room size and are *not* air conditioned. The bathrooms are communal in these dorms. Beck was just redone recently and I haven't had a chance to look inside, so I can't comment on it. Dixon Hall has much larger and newer rooms and is air conditioned with personal bathrooms. Golden Bear Village South and West and essentially apartments with personal bathrooms, air conditioning, and kitchens. University Place is strange in that it's a hybrid apartment and dorm. The bedrooms are larger than the older dorms and there is a large common space for you and your roommates, but there is no kitchen. I'm not familiar with the Honors dorm, so I can't comment on that.\n\nYou either love your roommate, hate your roommate, or learn to tolerate your roommate.\n\nIf I remember correctly, at least one of the tri-county dorms (Berks, Lehigh, Schuylkill) are quieter because of some study program they have. If Beck hasn't changed from last year, then it is a bit quieter too because it is part of some freshman experience program.\n\n- The crime rate has been increasing in recent years due to the influx of supposed gang activity in Reading, Allentown, and Philadelphia (yeah, they make their way up to Kutzown). I can't vouch for Kutztown being safer than any other colleges, but there are safety nets in place for students to feel protected.\n\n- The local food is your general college fare - pizza, burgers, Chinese, sandwiches, etc. Because of the strange policies of the Borough of Kutztown; however, you will be hard pressed to find chain restaurants. Some are slowly working their way in, but there's not too much.\n\nThere is a Weis supermarket in town, but unless you live off-campus right near 222, then it's not really walking-distance.\n\n- The water is not that good. I drink just about nothing but tap water and I am not a fan of Kutztown's. I'll drink it anyways though because why the hell should I spend money on bottled water? Invest in a Brita system or something similar and you'll be fine. Also, Kutztown tends to get boil water advisories every so often because of the position of the local reservoir. You learn to deal with it.\n\n- The community is great. It's a small school, so a lot of people tend to know one another. Get involved around campus and you'll get to do a lot of fun things and meet a bunch of great people.\n\nAs for the interaction among people in your major, it's all really what you make of it. Most majors have clubs/associations where you can stay in touch with your classmates and some of the majors are small enough that you tend to have classes with the same groups of people semester-after-semester.\n\n- I can't comment on your department's professors as I've only taken one English course, but professors are professors. Some are great, some absolutely suck, some are crazy, and some should probably be working elsewhere. Go to class, get to know your professors, and learn your shit or else you're going to have a rough time. They put in a lot of time and effort to teach you, so you should put in a lot of time and effort to learn the material.\n\n- Try to walk around campus and town and get a feel for what it's like without a tour guide pointing out all the positive things. Grab a bite in one of the restaurants in town or even just approach somebody walking around on campus and see what they have to say about KU. Also, don't be afraid to get in touch with somebody in the department of the major you'd like to be in. They can provide some insight about the educational aspect of the university that the tour guide might not necessarily be able to.\n\n- Seeing as I just graduated in May, it's somewhat hard to form an opinion on Kutztown yet. I miss going to classes and having freedom to do what I want, but at the same time I kind of wanted to get out and work. I'm around KU all the time because my girlfriend is still in school, so it's not like I have any sort of separation anxiety from the school haha. I still have a hunger for education that I know will eventually lead me back into higher education; Kutztown was great for what it was and it's a big part of the reason I want to continue furthering my education.\n\n\n\nMy advice to you for all of this is to just be thorough, think about what fits your needs, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Kutztown may or may not be the right fit for you, but if worst comes to worst, you can always transfer in or our of the school. Good luck to you, wherever you end up and don't be afraid to set the bar high for yourself.",

KU is a little bit... \"rapey.\" Stick to well lit areas, and out of dixon (yes, the dorm called dixon has the most rapes. I wish I was kidding.)\n\n3. Mr food is walking distance from campus, there are places on campus to get staples, and weis is a short drive for anything else you need.\n\n4.  I drink from the drinking fountains all the time, and I'm pretty picky myself.\n\n5. As long as you play a sport, or join a club, you'll meet people of different majors, dorms are also good for this if you make the effort.\n\n6. Some are good, some are bad. Ask around in your major, and plan classes accordingly.\n\n7. SPUDS!\n\n8. I'm still here, and I still like it. ",

            "comment": "&gt; What are the dorms like? Are they big, small? Do you like your roommate? Are there \"quiet\" dorms?\n\nThey're pretty standard in size.  Desk, dresser, bed, not much else.  If you're used to having your own room and tons of space, yeah, it's gonna seem small.  I had a really shitty roommate one semester, it happens.  My dorm was never very loud (Johnson and Dixon)\n\n&gt;What's the crime rate? I know some colleges where walking on campus alone at night is asking to get mugged. I assume this one is a tad bit safer.\n\nI never had an issue.  Branching out to secondhand encounters, the only issue I can think of is one of my friend's boyfriend was beating her outside of dixon.  He didn't go to KU, she was kind of trampy.\n\n&gt; How's the food in the area? Are there decent grocery/fast food places withing a reasonable walking distance?\n\nNot much really in walking distance from campus  (although I miss Spuds dearly).  On campus food (mealplan food) was always good.\n\n&gt; Weird question: How's the water taste? Some areas have really wonky water systems. I'll be coming from out of state if I get in, so water taste/difference is semi-relevant to me.\n\nI'm a really picky water drinker.  I don't drink tap water anywhere.  Britta filter or buy gallons from the grocery store (you can refill them at weis for like $0.35/gal)\n\n&gt; How would you rate your sense of community? Or interaction with those not in your preferred major?\n\nThat's entirely up to you.  College is what you make of it.\n\n&gt; How do you like your professors? I would be in the English/Information Science department I guess.\n\nThe professors I had varied greatly.  Some of the ones from my dept. blow the ones where I'm at now for Grad School out of the water.  But naturally there are some shitty professors too.  Ask around and check ratemyprofessor.com before picking classes, don't take classes with shitty professors.  Take ANY class you can with O'Boyle (Sociology)\n\n&gt; Anything not in the tour that I should check out?\n\nMeh, there's not much to kutztown.\n\n\n&gt; Finally, do you look back feeling happy, \"eh, it was college.\" or \"Wheee I'm gone bitches.\"? Feel free to make up your own response to that.\n\nLike I said, it is what you make of it.  My first two years sucked due to my own doing.  My last two years were the best of my life.\n\nDisclaimer:  I applied to KU very last minute after I got denied from the only school I applied to.  I never intended to graduate from KU, I wanted to transfer.  I stayed for 4 years, graduated with a great GPA, got into every grad school I applied to, and I left a small legacy behind in the form of a club.  I moved 700 miles away last fall, and I miss my KU friends dearly.",

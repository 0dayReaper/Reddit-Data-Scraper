I noticed it takes a long time to get an Uber and sometimes, no cars would even be available. \n\nTo solve this problem, I've built a very simple ride-sharing app called NoTrek. You can get it on the app store at [https://notrek.com/download](https://notrek.com/download). Basically, this is how it works\n\n1. You can request a ride from 30 minutes up to 1 week in advance\n2. A driver in the area will pick up the ride guaranteed\n3. You get your ride exactly when you need it.\n\nDownload it, get your first ride, and let me know what you think :)",

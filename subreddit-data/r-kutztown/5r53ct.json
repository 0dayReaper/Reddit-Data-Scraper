If you don't sign up with the referral you will still receive 6 months of Amazon Prime for free, however you won't receive $10 amazon credit. After your 6 months of Amazon Prime, you can renew for 50% ($49/yr for 4 years) which includes all Prime benefits or you can cancel your subscription.\n\n**Start using your college email to your advantage!**\n\n---\n\n[**Amazon Prime Student - Free $10 amazon credit**](http://a.co/efdDljy)\n",

    "postText": "Hey, /r/kutztown. I'm a current senior considering Kutztown for its music education program. I was browsing the website and I'm not sure how I feel about the housing situation. I'm personally sort of shy and enjoy my privacy - is sharing a bathroom with an entire floor as bad as it sounds? Do the stalls at least guarantee some privacy? I also read that all of the dorms are gender segregated by floor. As a guy who socializes mainly with girls I feel like this may be a problem. Is there a way around either of these problems? Thanks so much in advance!",

I find sharing a bathroom with a floor of dudes actually easier than my current situation (sharing with one other roommate in a large house).  Socializing isn't an issue either - you're allowed to hangout in each others' rooms ... it's not a problem.",

            "comment": "It's been a little while since I was at KU, but I'll do my best to answer your question. Keep in mind my info might be a little dated, but I can't imagine it has changed all that much.\n\nSo there are the dorms like what you mentioned where it's more communal. These are great if you want to be especially social. The dorms themselves are relatively cheap in cost compared to the higher end dorms. The trade off is the rooms are.. well.. dorm sized. Don't expect to have any privacy.\n\nThen there are the more expensive dorms like Golden Bear South. There is Golden Bear West as well, which are pretty nice, but they lack certain things South has. Basically South is like an apartment complex. I stayed there the majority of my time at KU. It's not as social, but there's a lot more room. It's not impossible to make friends in the halls though. You'd get more space, private bathrooms, full kitchen, etc.\n\nNow here's the trick. While the communal dorms are less expensive for the dorm itself, they do force you to buy a meal plan. Maybe you have a high tolerance for awful campus food. I don't know. But the food during my time was not great and the cost of the meal plan itself is fairly absurd.\n\nNow contrast that to the more expensive dorm, Golden Bear South. You'll pay more for the dorm, but you're not required to get a meal plan. That means if you're confident cooking for yourself, Golden Bear South is actually less expensive to live in than the other dorms. This is assuming you have a way to get to a grocery store however. Last I checked there were buses you could take. I had my own car so I'm not 100% sure of that these days.\n\nOther notable things to mention:\n\n- Golden Bear South did not have a curfew.\n\n- You could bring as many friends over as you like and have them stay as long as you'd like.\n\n- There was free pool tables and such when I was there. No clue now.\n\n- The only real down side is how far it is from the rest of the campus. If you don't mind walking however, it's not a big deal. Just kinda sucked during bad weather.\n\nAnything I mentioned above means the opposite is true in the more economy costed dorms. There was a max of two friends, they had to leave by a certain time, etc.\n\ntl;dr: Communal dorms are overall more expensive with less privacy and reliant on campus food. Private dorms have a lower net cost if you cook for yourself, more privacy, but less opportunities to be spontaneously social.\n\nHope that helps. KU has a good education program. Honestly though if your only hangup is who you can talk to in your dorm, you'll be meeting as many people as you'd like just going to class. Your dorm life will not be your defining social factor.",

As far as sharing the bathroom, it wasn't that bad. You will be behind a door (like a bathroom stall door) and a shower curtain. If you have any other questions feel free to message me. ",

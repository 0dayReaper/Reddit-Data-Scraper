    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019ve just been accepted into KU, but apparently first year students are required to live on campus. I was wondering if there\u2019s a way to opt out of this or if I even have to opt out at all given that I never signed up to be living on campus. I apologize if this even sounds like a dumb question to be asking, this is probably something that I should already know. I was also wondering if there\u2019s anything that I should know as a first year student. I got accepted awhile back and I still feel so confused and overwhelmed. Thank you!",

I'll try and help you out, though.\n\nArnolds fun center has go carts and shit- not far away\n\n\nYou've got allentown nearby which has lehigh valley mall and a bunch of bars and night clubs.\n\n\n\nYou have Reading in the other direction- There is a place called The Works in Wyomissing- sort of like a Dave and Busters- in that same plaza is Reading Rocks which is an indoor climbing area and building 22 which is a nightclub. \n\n\nLike hunting? A lot of hunting places nearby. \n\n\nLike Mountains? Poconos is close. Jim Thope is a bit over an hour drive and there is an awesome paint ball place called skirmish. \n\n\nOther than that- you're better off hopping on the NE extension and going towards Philly. ",

    "postText": "Hey. So I am a freshman here at KU and so far I've spent the last month feeling really home sick and I feel like I haven't made any friends yet. I haven't tried any activities or groups yet and I'm not sure where to start. I am super shy and it's hard for me to make friends. I like video games, I heard there's a gaming club is it any good? I also played volleyball and tennis in high school but I don't know if there's anything for those. So I'm just wondering what are some good clubs to meet people in? ",

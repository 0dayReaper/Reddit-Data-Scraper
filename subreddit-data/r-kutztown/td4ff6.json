    "postText": "Hi, r/kutztown. If you're taking the MCAT and are looking for a CARS resource, check out CARShub! As you might know, doing well on the CARS section requires a lot of practice. Fortunately, CARShub has over 300 passages, all presented in the typical MCAT user interface (alongside many other features). Please give it a try at https://carshub.xyz ! We've put a lot of work into it and would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",

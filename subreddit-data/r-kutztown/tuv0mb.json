Too much of a party school and admissions are overly lax on who they admit, hence the poor quality of students. \n\nPros: Beautiful campus, wonderful area, rent is decent. They are known for their Art and Education program.",

Not only that I joined clubs in attempt to meet people. I made tons of friends at LCCC, which in my personal opinion was one of the best academic institutions I attended.\n\nThe campus is gorgeous cuz all the money you took out on loans got spent on making it look nice. Colleges operate as businesses so of course their campus is going to look attractive to draw people in.",

I\u2019ve made wayyyy more friends at KU. I\u2019m a Sec Education major and it\u2019s my first semester. Kinda curious what you enjoyed about LCCC more than KU because it\u2019s the opposite for me",

When I transferred to KU I was older (23 going on 24) and did not click with the younger 18-21 crowd. I majored in Public Administration/Political Science at the time. It just wasn\u2019t the school for me. I thought the campus was pretty but that was it.",

I am not sure how their PoliSci department is, but maybe I am lucky to be enjoying my time so far because KU is known for their education department. I transferred to KU at 21. I agree that I also think age and maturity levels might\u2019ve made things harder for you since 18 and 24 is vastly different. LCCC and other CCs certainly do have a mixed bag of students. I\u2019m sorry to hear you didn\u2019t have the best experience at KU. Hope things are a bit better now for you",

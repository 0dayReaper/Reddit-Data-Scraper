    "postText": "I'll be going to Kutztown in the Fall as a writing major, and I have a few questions about the university.\n\n1. How friendly are the students? I'm not much of a partier, so I hope it isn't a gigantic party school.\n\n2. Is the internet bad? I know that it used to pretty awful, but I've been told that it has improved over the years.\n\n3. What's the best way to make friends on-campus?\n\n4. What are the dorms like?\n\n5. When would I start signing up for classes? I've committed to the campus, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to start signing up immediately or if I need to wait until orientation.\n\n6. Anything else I should know? \n\nThank you!\n",

Make friends with people in your dorm, sit next to people in class you might want to be friends with, join clubs.\n4. Which dorm are you in? They're all different.\n5. I believe you are assigned classes automatically your first semester. Every semester after that you meet with your adviser to discuss classes, then you choose them yourself online.\n6. Don't skip class! Have fun and good luck.",

I think I'll end up joining quite a few clubs and given that I tend to be more shy, I'm not positive of how I'll make friends in the dorm but I'll think of something. And ah, the thing about the classes makes a lot of sense. Thank you~",

            "comment": "I don't know if you still lurk, but here's another perspective as an older student commuting:\n\n1. Students seem nice. I've been able to chit chat with just about anyone I choose to and make small talk. \n\n2. The internet is decent on the north side of campus. Again, I don't live on campus so I can't speak for the dorms.\n\n3. Talk to people. Just make small talk in your classes and see if you have multiple classes with the same people. If you have any projects, reach out to classmates and see if they want to work on them together. \n\n4. N/A.\n\n5. You have to attend orientation before you're allowed to sign up for classes and even then I believe you have to wait until later in the summer to do so. Sign up for an early orientation (early June) and get it out of the way.\n\n6. If you need assistance with anything such as technology, financial aid, class registrations, etc; don't have your parents call. I work in one of the above positions on campus. We are not allowed under any circumstances to talk about your school information with anyone but you. Don't let your mom call us and then rant because we won't speak to her. Just give us a call and it'll be sorted in a few minutes.\n\nStart your classwork early! This way if you have questions about it, you're not complaining because your professor won't answer your email and it's due in 3 hours. Make your index cards for easy studying each day for your classes so you're not making them all at once the week of the test.\n\nPut your schoolwork first. I know, you'll tell me that this is what you will do and you won't be distracted. You'll be distracted. Today is the second day of finals week and I'm not stressing at all. I completed all my work ahead of time and did well enough during the semester that I barely have to pass my finals to get A's. Don't be like the other kids stressing out and pulling all-nighters because this grade is make or break for you. You'll do worse anyone just from lack of sleep.\n\nChoose a major worth the ~$50,000 you'll be spending to attend here. You'll be paying that money back one day and student loans don't just go away. Ever. Use your time wisely.",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm a professional writing major and will be a senior in the fall. ~Welcome.~ Is there a specific area of writing in which you're trying to concentrate? \n\nLytle (the English building) is the ugliest of them all and a cruel walk during the winter, but the program itself is pretty cool. If you get the chance, take Bleach. He's a very entertaining lecturer and you'll actually learn something. Pop Music Journalism is a fantastic class, and will fulfill one of your two 300-level writing requirements. \n\n1. Students are pretty friendly, but as a transfer student and commuter after the first semester, I never really found a \"group\" and mostly just had a friend or two in each class. Your experience will probably differ. \n\n2. It's somewhat shitty, but better than it was last semester. The most annoying part is getting kicked off on your phone every time you change buildings. \n\n3. Probably leaving your dorm door open the first weeks of school. Say \"yes\" to everything. \n\n4. I lived in Golden Bear South for one semester, but not the dorm-dorms. \n\n5. I believe you have to wait until after orientation. At my transfer orientation, I met with my advisor and we talked about my interests a little bit and picked everything, but I also had my gen eds out of the way. \n\n6. \na) If you can afford to study abroad over the summer to fulfill your language requirements, do it. As a professional writing major, you're required to take two semesters of language at the intermediate level, but for most people, that means 3-4 semesters (including elementary I and/or II as well). In 4 weeks of study abroad time, you'll get all of your language credits done with. Inquire about this ASAP if it is something you might be able to do. \n\nb) You are also required to do an internship to graduate from the program. I don't know if this sounds scary or not to you, but it's not. What is scary, though, is you're basically entirely on your own to find it. Start looking around YESTERDAY to figure out where you'll be interning so you have a plan. \n\nc) The food is basically all horrible, especially if you have any concern for your diet, and you're required to have a meal plan if you live in the dorms. I'm sorry. ",

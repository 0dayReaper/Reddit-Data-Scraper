Yes, lots of people are doing great work to try and help, but so little of it is getting to students fast enough. Interested in helping us make that happen? We are always looking to expand and your help could make all the difference!\n\nWe are Icarus, a new organization currently based out of the University of Pennsylvania looking to expand chapters to schools all across Pennsylvania! We have a variety of projects currently in the works, including working with school district administrations to develop new wellness programs, partnerships with college community programs that promote different aspects of mental and emotional health, and even a partnership with a US Congresswoman to eventually bring some of our ideas to DC! \n\nInterested in joining? Check out the \u201cJoin Us\u201d link on our website! Students, faculty, anyone with any interest is encouraged to reach out! Have any questions? Feel free to DM me or email at icarusresearchgroup@gmail.com!",

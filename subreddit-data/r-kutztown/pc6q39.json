    "postText": "I went to a different, much larger, school for the past 3 years. I am transferring to Kutztown because I have changed my major and it is much less money.\n\nAt my old school we had a very active Reddit community. I would go there every day and I enjoyed it a lot. Despite that school having more than 4 times as many students as Kutztown it seemed to feel like more of a community.\n\nNow classes start in a few days and I am completely out of the know about Kutztown. I do not know anything about the university, if there are things I should know etc\u2026\n\nI have not even seen the campus yet.\n\nIt would be nice to just see that there are other people who go here online. I have tried joining a Facebook group, but nothing. Is that really the only place? Even there it just says 10 posts a week. I know absolutely nothing about this school and the people who go to it. I am not anticipating making any friends, but a nice online community to point me in the right direction wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.",

That's where you will meet people, make lifelong friends and find new things that interest you.\n\nI recommend paying attention to the posters on the boards outside and around buildings for events to join.\n\nThere's sports clubs, intramural sports, a gaming club and lots of others.\n\nI'm not sure why you seem invested in there being online posts about kutztown. Going out and participating in the real world at kutztown is what you'll remember and enjoy.\n\n---\n\nIn regard to not knowing anything about kutztown; I recommend going on their website and checking out whatever you might be interested in.",

My old school has a 14,000 people subreddit and it made a school of 40,000 people feel tight knit because everyone would make posts about what is going on around campus, not things like the next club meeting, but actual events that occurred on campus (not organized events, but newsworthy things). \n\nI don\u2019t plan on joining any clubs, I mainly miss the community aspect that the online group brought.",

For example, look for Kutztown class of 2025.\n\nKutztown is small so there isn't much of a reddit community; likely also due to the majority of students going for teaching or other less tech related fields.\n\nI highly recommend looking into the clubs. That's where all my friends and experiences at kutztown came from; And I'm still actively friends with people I met in the club til this day.",

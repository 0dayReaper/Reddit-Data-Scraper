            "comment": "Bars are few and far between. You have the ktown pub and shorty\u2019s. Shorty\u2019s I would stay away from as it\u2019s just a sweaty basement full of college kids drunk on well liquor. The Pub has decent food and is a bit less reckless. \nAbout a mile down the road is Saucony Creek Brewery, pretty good imo. Snuzzle\u2019s is a hidden gem a few minutes outside of town. Cash only, good selection of food options. Ozgoods is solid as well if you\u2019re looking for more of a sit-down family environment",

Their bartender is great, too. \n\nSnuzzles gets busy on weekends but on a weekday it's a great spot for pizza and unique sandwiches. Try the house salad with Ellen's creamy herb dressing. \n\nIf you go to the kutztown tavern and get soft pretzels make sure they give you some of the homemade mustard dip. \n\nKtown pub and shortys are the college bars. Basin Street is where the alumni hang out and the burgers and wings are great.  Also, sunday brunch.",

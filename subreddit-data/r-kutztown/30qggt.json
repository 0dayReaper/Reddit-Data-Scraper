    "postText": "I'll be attending Kutztown in the fall as a writing major (although that may change). I've heard a ton of conflicting reviews about the university, but I loved the atmosphere when I came to visit and the students seemed friendly. I have a few questions for those of you who are on campus:\n\n1. How friendly are the students? I'm not much of a partier, and I'm hoping that it isn't a huge party school.\n\n2. How bad is the internet really? I know that it used to be pretty awful, but I was told that it has improved over the years. What speeds should I expect?\n\n3. What is the best way to make friends on campus?\n\n4. How are the dorms?\n\n5. When do I start signing up for classes? Do I sign up at orientation?\n\nThank you!\n",

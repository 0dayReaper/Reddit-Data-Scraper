    "postText": "I have to mention this publicly because they are a threat to our community. A few years ago, an at the time art student named Abigail Cosgrove attempted to sexually assault me. Here is my story.\n\nI was hit up by someone I barely knew at the time. A friend of a friend situation. I only met her once before this and she barely even talked to me, so I assumed she was just that. But I woke up to a Snapchat message at 3 am asking me what I was doing. I could barely sleep, so I decided to go on a walk and talk with her. This is when she asked if I wanted to hangout a bit, so I said sure and I headed to her place.\n\nAt this time I found I out she was intoxicated and asked if she would rather hangout a different time. She insisted I stay the night. Whether it was because I also had been drinking a bit on my own earlier that night or if it was because I thought she was cute, I said sure. We talked briefly and I said I should really get back to my place, but once again she asked if I could sleep next to her. I did end up staying that night but I tried to keep my distance. She kept feeling me up and trying to grab by my thighs, but I pushed her hands away from there. This would happen more than once and I even mentioned once if she did it again I would leave. That one night she did stop but every other night she would invite me over.\n\nAt the time I was single and so was she. I thought maybe she wanted something more, but I didn\u2019t work out. However she kept making sexual moves on me, saying how nobody wants her and her constant feeling me up. One day, someone tells me that she has an std. I confront her about this because despite making sexual moves on me like trying to feel my groin, she never told me. She admit that she had it, and I tried to stay friends with her, but that ended when the reality set in. That this person lied to me about not having an std when I had asked her before. I will clarify that I never got one from her or anyone else, but she was willing to give it to me without even telling me.\n\nAfter this, I eventually filed a police report. I was sent to the campus police since it occurred on their grounds. They said they would look into it. The police claimed that they could not charge someone for this sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault. The reasoning was that \u201cyou were able to resist her\u201d. Because everyone knows that if a crime is almost committed to you, and you escape it, clearly the person isn\u2019t a threat to anyone right? \n\nI think she is still a student going for a graduate degree for student affairs out of all things. She is still present at the Presidents Ambassadors despite them being informed about her actions. I know you can\u2019t boot people out for accusations, but there was not even an investigation into this. That\u2019s my problem. She used her influence and power and abused it, and she still has it. But they won\u2019t stop her because I was able to escape it? Not very sound logic.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve struggled with mental issues and trust for going on about 2 years now. I also was told by someone who did sleep with her, that she did the same thing to him successfully. He already had the same std at the time, but he never brought it up and event roasted her as well. Meaning while he did not get the std from her, she did the same exact thing successfully to someone else. She is clearly a danger to the school and the people around her. She hides the fact of her genital herpes from her parents because \u201cthey don\u2019t need to know\u201d. Meanwhile their daughter is actively not telling people and not practicing safe sex at all. \n\nI hope this is a lesson or a sign to people to avoid Abigail Cosgrove. As one of her victims of sexual harassment, it\u2019s a shame to say at least I wasn\u2019t a victim of her other crimes. I felt the need to get this story out there and off of my chest in order to see some kind of justice. I don\u2019t want anything like slutshaming or saying all people with stds are bad, but she should not be in a position that she can use over people to get her way with them.\n\nEdit: corrected the name",

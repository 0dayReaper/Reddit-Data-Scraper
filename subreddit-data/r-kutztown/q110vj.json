    "postText": "I just transferred here and I\u2019m not sure if I want to finish college because of how much I hate this place compared to my old school. I had to come here due to money reasons, and honestly I really wish I could have just stayed at my old school. I can\u2019t think of a single good thing to say about Kutztown, I hate it so much.\n\nI hate all of the people here, everyone is so unfriendly, everyone has a sense of arrogance to them. \n\nThe location is complete shit. The town of Kutztown is a terrible town, I hate driving passed the elementary school in the morning or home and having rhe jackass crossing guards fuck me over constantly.\n\nIt feels like a place that is incomplete. Just bland grass and trees everywhere, shitty sidewalk design. It\u2019s like a winding network of sidewalks in between a bunch of ugly boring buildings that are old af and trees and grass. Wow so lively.\n\nOld main is one of the worst things on the planet.\n\nI hate having to cross a busy street to get to old main.\n\nThe classrooms feel extremely depressing and dark, one room schoolhouses would feel more inviting.\n\nThere is something about the girls here that I truly hate. Dressed like whores and an arrogance to match, meanwhile they\u2019re all education majors.\n\nThe professors are pretty bad. One of my\nProfessors in particular makes me\nWonder what qualifications you need to be a professor here.\n\nThe only good thing I can say is that the administrative staff seem to be on top of things.\n\nAlso, there are some really annoying ghetto kids here. I\u2019m trying to listen to the professor talk, not you flapping your gums in the back.\n\nDo people actually like going here or is it just out of\nNecessity?\n\nI would never go here if I had a choice, it makes me want to die now, thinking that I have to go through this shitty school, and then right to working until I dry up and die",

Every college has a few shitty professors, my undergrad and now grad program has it's fair share, but the majority of my professors have been at the very least competent and intelligent people. \nAlso, who on earth complains about something as mundane as crossing a busy street or having to wait for cross guards by the elementary school? How about you just take another road, I've commuted to KU for like 5 years now and can easily avoid the elementary school.\nAnd who gives you the right to judge the students here and call them whores and ghetto? Plenty of these students are busting their asses, especially in the education program, and all you have is judgement. And again, every college has stupid inconsiderate kids, doesn't mean the whole student body is like that.\nIt seems like the main problem here is your lack of tolerance for normal but mildly inconvenient facts of life. If anyone at this university is being arrogant and unfriendly, it's you.",

I am an extrovert so it's easy for me. But make the best of it. You have no other choice besides dropping out. \n\nJoin a greek organization. Find a tribe. Date.\n\nI LOVED KU and miss it to this day. ! And I am from the Jersey shore. \n\nGood luck",

Everything in life is what you make of it.  You\u2019ve made up your mind that the school is not right for you. That\u2019s okay. There are plenty of others to transfer to.\n\nI recommend you take a week off and visit other schools.  Millersville, West Chester, Lock Haven, Shippensburg, etc. are all comparably priced and within a relatively short drive.  Spend a day at each one. Walk around campus, talk to people, interact with professors and staff.  Go in with an open and see what comes of it. Good luck on your journey!",

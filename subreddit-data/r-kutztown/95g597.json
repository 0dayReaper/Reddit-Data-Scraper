Are there even any in common areas or something? Seems weird that the welcome packs have microwave popcorn in them if there's no microwaves!",

The last time I dormed in a traditional dorm was in like 2014 (lol). Th microfridge was a bit scammy imo since the microwave barely heated the food up and the fridge was insanely small. I would call up the college on that one. ",

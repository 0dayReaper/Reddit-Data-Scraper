I changed my major far too late in the game because I refused to graduate with a degree that I found I had only minimal interest in. I'm proud to say, though, that I'm working at our admissions office, trying to help high school students avoid that mistake when I meet those who seem like they're going to choose a major when they're not completely sure they want to. This, and a couple of other events, sparked my change of interest to Higher Ed that caused me to change my major.\n\nAhem. So yes. I'm undergrad. ",

The beginning courses were definitely C++.  \n\nEither way, I've been in the field for a while now and I can confidently say it doesn't matter.  Most universities are going to be behind the latest trends anyways, and all programming exp will be useful.\n\nAnd agreed on the professors.  I went to the University of Georgia for grad school, and the KU profs were definitely better teachers.",

The first course was geared toward CS majors while the second course was more tailored to other uses within the STEM fields. I don't have anything more to really add, except that I did find the professors I had to be pretty good, and generally willing to work with students.\n\nEdited to add: the Python course was named Advanced Scientific Programming, which you can probably find a description for in the school's catalog.",

Intro classes and data structure courses are taught in c++.\n\nBeyond that languages are all over the place. During my time there I coded in c++, C#, Javascript, Python, and LISP. Some of the profs also pushed Java heavily, but I never had them so I'm one of the few people who graduated without programming Java.",

As you move up through the classes there will be less focus on the language itself and more on the projects that you'll be working on.\n\nThose who are new to programming focus a lot on languages, but as you grow as a programmer the languages matter less and less.\n\nIf you want to give yourself a head start, run through some C++ tutorials where you use the command line with the gcc complier to write your code.",

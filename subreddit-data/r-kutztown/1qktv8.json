    "postText": "Hey, Im a possible incoming freshmen looking into KU as one of my top two schools \"other being Bloomsburg\". Already have been accepted, and its pretty much neck and neck between which one is better from my pov so far.\n\nSo pretty much just wanted to ask some small ...obscure questions.  \n\n* How are the roommates decided on?  \n* I saw from the flyers around campus last week there is a gaming club that holds LAN parties. What types of games do people play at KU?  \n* Do most students live on or near campus and don't commute?  \n* Read from lerking around some posts on here that \"there is nothing to do but party and get drunk\" is that true?  \n* Any computer science majors? What do you have to say about it?  \n* So the desks, are there better ones then the one in Old Main I assume? Sitting in them, I had to guess those things were some 30+ years old or something. \n* Any advice you have for KU? Certain dorm halls to choose, places to eat, things to do, clubs to join, etc?\n\nThanks, appreciate it.\n\n\n\n",

If you like cheese steaks, there are five places in town to get them as well as other great food, I was an officer for the Geology club last year, we do fun outdoorsy things. ",

            "comment": "You can request roommates but mostly you are thrown in with someone who matches a little questionnaire you take.\n\nThe gaming club almost EXCLUSIVELY plays SSB, SSBB, Magic: The Gathering and Halo/CoD.\n\nMost students live on campus, yes.\n\nKutztown is a small town. Lots of people drink. That doesn't mean you can't hang with people. There's a movie theater nearby, and a park, but nothing like amazing. I don't drink, but I just hang out with people all the time. I don't know what people expect, it's like they want a Chuck E. Cheese around here or something.\n\nI have lots of CompSci friends and I took a course. They say it's really rough on you year 1 to filter out people who don't care. Just go to class and you'll be fine, especially if you have Day. \n\nThere aren't really better desks in Old Main. The other classrooms are fine though. From what I've seen. This is my second year here, btw.\n\nFind people. Dixon is nice. Johnson has an ambulance by it every night and you hear nothing but stoner stories. Don't trust the fish here. The salad upstairs south isn't washed from what I can taste. The best places to eat are Mark's, Kutztown Pub (for burgers), Kutztown Tavern (for like anything), Spuds (not the greatest but I love their gourmet fries) and Uncle Joe's (everyone will praise Mama's but it's meh IMO). \n\nKutztown doesn't release tuition info until the 4-payment Sallie Mae plan is almost up, too. Be wary of that. Public safety has been known to screw people over as well as the advisers. You hear stories. Welcome to Kutztown, though, hope you have a good time. Keep in mind, the most outstanding points about a school are the bad ones. People complain about their lives but they rarely praise the good things. Just visit and take a look around. Despite all the things I said, I love it here. It's like my favorite place. Yeah it has shortcomings but everywhere does.",

            "comment": "* roommates are random unless you sign up with someone\n* never been to gaming club but LoL is very popular\n* lots of commuters but the majority of students live on campus\n* Lots of partying and drugs if that's not your thing there's always other stuff to do\n* Not a computer science major but it is pretty tough so I hear\n* Old Main is like the oldest building on campus. Rooms and seats are shit. No complaints about any other academic buildings\n* Dixon hall is nice. Avoid Johnson and Deatrick",

            "comment": "- Your roommates freshman year are randomly selected I believe. \n- Don't join the Gaming guild, generally its gay as hell. \n- Most students do live on campus. But I would recommend moving off campus ASAP because on campus housing sucks as does the school food. \n- Yes, that is slightly true. It doesn't really matter though because what you'll do is make friends then just hang out with them all the time. \n- Yes, I am also a comp sci major. Personally I like the major but be prepared to work especially CSC136 generally half the class fails that.\n- Yes, old main sucks, any classes in Grim are better, which is where most of your comp sci classes will be. Also take CSC 136 with anyone but Speigle if you can. Also take everything with Frye because shes the best professor in the department. \n- Don't choose Dixon, everyone chooses dixon and you don't meet anyone living there. Pick LeHeigh it just got renovated last semester.  \n\nEdit: Comp. Sci Senior and Student Worker. ",

            "comment": "I have a CS degree from KU.  I'm now working on my Master's in CS at the University of Georgia.  I can tell you from firsthand experience that the professors at KU are better at *teaching* than at UGA.  They might not be as experienced or have as many papers published, but they're fantastic teachers.  It's a shame that KU doesn't have a fantastic reputation because that CS staff is really solid.\n\n- I was never involved in CS/Gaming type clubs, but I did play ultimate which I highly recommend. \n\n- Don't worry about the facilities, they're fine.\n\n- Don't worry about which dorm you're in, dorm life sucks, but it's an integral part of college.  Having a shitty freshmen roommate makes you stronger ... even if he does blast \"Born in the USA\" on repeat 23 hours a day (I swear to god that happened to me).\n\n- There isn't a lot to do in the city of Kutztown, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to do.  Make some friends and just do whatever you guys like doing (gaming, working out, drinking, rock climbing, whatever).  If you have a hobby you can find others who want to participate in it with you.",

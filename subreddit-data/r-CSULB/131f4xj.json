Scammers use tricks like this to scare you into clicking that link, after you click your information will have been \u2018phished\u2019. Honestly, once you see the signs of a scam they all look so fake.\n\nAnother thing, Id highly recommend *deleting this post* since your full name is featured at the top\u2026\n\nI just recently had an incident with a weirdo on the CSULB Reddit. The creeper didn\u2019t like something I said, so they did a deep-dive on my comments and tried to use my personal information to be a cyber bully towards me. They continued harassing me for days until I blocked them. it was stressful and annoying to say the least\u2026",

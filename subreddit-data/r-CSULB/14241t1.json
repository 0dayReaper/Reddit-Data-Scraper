    "postText": "Hi yall, If you ever transferred and have experience or transferrin like I am, I\u2019d extreeeemely appreciate ur experiences at this point. I\u2019m a new marketing student transferring in from a community college in a different state. Gonna start at csulb as a junior in Fall 2023, and I am gonna or plan to graduate in 2025 Spring/Summer. The thing is, how would my credits transfer from my current college considering it\u2019s an out-of-state college? I saw the lower division requirements or suggested courses that I had to take and I\u2019ve literally taken almost everything and submitted my in-progress transcripts. But THEN, when I check the MyCSULB to see how credits are transferred, it shows only two courses have been transferred out of ALL the other classes, I have taken for two years. Should I be concerned?? or is it still in progress and they\u2019re still reviewing it? but if they are, aren\u2019t they taking a little bit too long? Thank youuu\u2764\ufe0f",

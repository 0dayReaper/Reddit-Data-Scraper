I never did because I forgot, and I graduated from undergrad with no issues.",

While it\u2019s unlikely that this will cause you to become rejected, it is possible.",

            "comment": "My son may get a D in AP Econ.... I contacted admissions by filling out an online IT ticket request regarding provisional acceptance, and Admissions responded within an hour. They said it depends on college prep completion/GPA,  A-G requirements, which AP Econ is NOT (and my son has plenty other A-G courses that fulfill this block of courses so he doesn't need it anyway) as well as an index they use. It's all on their website, and you may have a chance to appeal if you get rescinded. There are some index formulas, including grade 10-12 Academic GPA and grade 10-12 STEM GPA for Math/Science majors (all GPAs are weighted for Honors and/or AP, but you ONLY get the 1 pt grade boost if you get a C or better in the Honors/AP class, a D will not get the boost.  And only 2 Honors/AP courses from 10th grade may be used for boost, and I believe it's 8 or 10 boosts max.\nIn a nutshell, my belief is that one D in a non-major-related course that is not needed for (A-G) requirement or HS graduation will probably not cause you to be rescinded unless you are already near the bottom of their \"index\" cutoff for acceptance, or have a borderline GPA.  Good luck!",

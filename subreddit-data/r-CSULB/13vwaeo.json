    "postText": "Denied entry to the honors program because i have too many credits. \nYup that\u2019s it. I get the reasoning behind it and they want people to finish up the program but it\u2019s only a few courses that i can finish up in 2 semester if they let me have them concurrently. I even have a minor declared that might gave to keep me in for an extra year, but they really said \u201cyou won\u2019t be able to take them because you\u2019d be too busy doing the other courses\u201d. How do you know???? It felt like i was pleading my case with my parents to let me go out with my friends in 7th grade. I just don\u2019t understand the decisions and explanations this university sometimes offers. I\u2019m trying to apply to a PhD program next semester and without a thesis I\u2019m practically at a very high disadvantage.",

            "comment": "If it makes you feel better, doctoral programs are VERY competitive, ESPECIALLY in Psychology. The chances of you getting in with just a BA are slim or close to none with no publication or research experience. You'd be a much more competitive applicant with an MS/MA.\n\nThe honors program is great and the thesis is a good thing to add your resume, but have you put thought into what PhD programs you actually want to apply to and their requirements?\n \nWhat would you put in your statement of purpose, especially if they ask for relevant publications and research (not just college courses, work experience, and volunteering)? Do you have letters of recommendations from professors in your chosen field (not lecturers, but actual assistant professors or up)? Is the GRE required and do they recommend the Psych GRE?",

I do know what program i want to get into which is clinical and that\u2019s the hardest one to get into regardless of the experiences i have and i have identified universities i want to work with and professors whose research interest me. The  GREs are not required for any of the programs and the put heavy emphasis on both research and field experiences, but mostly research. I do have good letters of rec from people in the field. The hard part is now it\u2019s basically a requirement to have a publication before going in there which i was hoping to get out of my thesis at least.",

                            "comment": "By publication experience, PhD programs are looking for more than an honors thesis. More like a a publication in a journal (best-case, but not likely as an undergrad) or at least a school-affiliated/reputable magazine.\nMost PhD positions are fully funded. They're investing tens of thousands of dollars plus (hopefully) stipend in you. You really need to explain to them why you're worth the funding, especially if you're applying for BA to PhD against people who have their MS/MA and have clearly shown they are capable of graduate level research. I bet most PhD candidates in cohorts have their master's. \n\nIMO, you should:\n\n1) cast a wide net and apply to MS/MA and PhD programs. Worst case scenario is that you get into an master's program. Or offered a spot in a master's cohort instead of the school's PhD program. \n\n2) heavily lean onto your experience in your SOP. Clearly state how your past and current research has prepared you for future contributions in your current field. Give your SOP to your LOR so that they can speak even more highly of your ability to do graduate level work.\n\nI wouldn't stress about publication experience if you're applying this coming cycle for Fall 2024. There's the saying \"trust the process.\" You'll probably get into good MS/MA programs. Or you'll be accepted into a lower tier doctoral program and accept the offer because \"it only takes one.\" Maybe you'll only get partially funded positions (in which case, I would just go for a master's or apply again in the next cycle. You def want fully funded.). \n\nThere's A LOT more doctoral applicants than there are candidate positions. Many people go into a master's program and use the experience as a launching point for a PhD. Just focus on making your application as strong as possible with the experience you have.",

The program has a point if you had to take all of the honors classes (3 of them total + 1 thesis prep course and writing a 30-45 page thesis) on top of your major and minor you would be at over 18 credits a semester easily. They\u2019re sticking their neck out on your work and you turn in shoddy work it won\u2019t look good on their credibility.",

I did mine this past semester and published what is basically a law review of a controversial First Amendment case, what was continuously told to me by tenured professors in m dept was that admissions is not expecting you to write industry changing material or something that can compete with Harvard Law Review but prove that you CAN do it. You are constantly told that you need to keep it within the scope of an undergrad thesis or else it ends up arising suspicion of you and your thesis advisor.",

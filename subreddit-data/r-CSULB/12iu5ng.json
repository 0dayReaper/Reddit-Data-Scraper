It\u2019s bullshit that i get a registration date behind a lot of people because i completed more credits. Do enrollment offices realize that people might need some specific courses that they need to use for graduate school. Not even that, do they not realize that some of us have requirements that still need to be met before graduation? I\u2019m really here watching myself get waitlisted to all the courses that i need and want to take for graduate studies and graduation.",

One was just a couple hours earlier than the other and she was making a fuss out of it. \n\nAll while I was sitting there with an April 6th date for my senior year. AINT THAT SOME BULLSH*T",

Have an optional petition online where people get to write an essay or a paragraph as to why they need an earlier registration date (the people who are desperate and need one will more likely fill it out) and the office can decide if it is necessary or not. Have more open seats for each class instead of limiting them.",

Also opening more sections means those have to be filled, or else a lot more people are gonna have certain classes dropped from the schedule bc not enough people signed up. \n\nThey also already give more priority to those who have less classes left. That\u2019s like the main thing they go off of, other than other specific reasons people might have priority (Honors, disability, athletics, etc). Best bet is to look into what options are available to you to get more priority registration.",

The only ones that do are in the elective courses that are in list A, B, C i.e. a person I know who is a theatre major is taking an engineering class elective. GPA would not impact other majors. I don't see a flock of liberal arts majors going into stem courses and vise versa. Also, a lot of courses have prerequisites that make majors courses exclusively for that major. So, a GPA one would be a good solution that way it's fair game for everyone. For the second option, I called them two days ago asking them a reasonable explanation for making me register at a late date even though I still have a year left and they said that it's because i have more credits than a lot of people. A lot of people who are going into their senior year have already registered. I'm just here watching all the courses that I need go away. I already applied for honors, but they won't get back to me before may/june since I just transferred here last semester.",

Seniors get to register before juniors, etc. If the people you know are registering earlier, these are the reasons why:\n\n\\- They have more credits.  \n\\- They are athletes.  \n\\- They have a documented disability.  \n\\- They are in some other special campus program that provides early registration (e.g., honors). \n\nThere just isn't a more fair way to arrange registration dates, and some students have way more credits than you would think.\n\np.s., for the people who suggest basing registration dates on GPA there are two big problems:\n\n1. Some majors and colleges have much higher average GPAs than others, their students would get all the GEs and leave nothing for everyone else.   \n2. Do transfer GPAs count? If so, then students with lots of transfer credits would all enroll earlier because CC grades tend to be much higher than CSULB grades.",

GPA os a completely fair way to do so. 1) It\u2019s an incentive for people to do better semester through semester. A lot of people here with hogh GPAs have already posted saying the same thing that it isn\u2019t fair. 2) Seeing the point you\u2019re trying to make. It should be CSULB gpa and not cumulative GPA between the two. Incoming transfer already register in June so they are not a problem with the registration problem happening this semester. By the time they get here, the school should have a temporary semester GPA of the grades they already have for the fall/spring they\u2019re in. By Spring, they would have had an official CSULB GPA. CSULB GPA seems completely fair.",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone, \n\nMay this email reach you well. \n\nI am a PhD student at UCLA conducting a study for my thesis. I was hoping you guys could help me in filling out this quick survey. It's a series of questions with no right or wrong answer. If you feel tempted to look up the answers to find the correct one, do not worry, I am not assessing whether or not you got it right. I want you to go in as if this was any exam and try your best answering. \n\n[This is the questionnaire](https://forms.gle/HLoQba2CkJqLMhP37)\n\nThank you and have a great day!",

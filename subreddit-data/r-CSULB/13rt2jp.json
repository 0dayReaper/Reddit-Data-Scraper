Apparently he doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t do that anymore because the MAE advisor had a talk with him about it. He also got complaints from students about some other things, but I swear he\u2019s one of the nicest dudes ever. Those students in my opinion, were tripping.",

The tests were honestly brutal but i averaged about 35% on the tests and passed. BUT he ended up curving about 25% so dont worry about what he said. Just try to get an average grade for the exams and squeeze some points out of attendance, hw, and quizzes and you\u2019ll do fine.",

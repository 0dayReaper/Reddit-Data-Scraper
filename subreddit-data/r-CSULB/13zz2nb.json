    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m currently a rising senior getting ready to make action plans for colleges I want to go to. As of now, I\u2019m really interested in attending Long Beach as a history major but I need to take into consideration what living situation would be best for me. To commute from my parents home would be about 44 miles however, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best plan for me since I\u2019ve seen how traffic can really take a toll on you. I\u2019ve also looked into apartments and I know I would be able to live with my cousin who plans to transfer from CC when I would possibly be attending and we would have at least one other roommate. Then there\u2019s dorms which I would feel comfortable with but I don\u2019t know if it would be worth the money since I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s not much of a social scene and could get expensive with time. For those that have lived in apartments or in dorms, how was your experience,and what would you recommend?",

I will say though do what is financially better for you and your situation :)!",

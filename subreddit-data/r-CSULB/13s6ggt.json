Ideally befriend a couple upperclassmen that are a year older to get the deets and resources easier. \n\nJoining clubs or societies can help with this and provide a more regular stream of information when y\u2019all vent about terrible experiences together. Their trauma doesn\u2019t need to be your future trauma.\n\nAlso Vu is manageable in the rare case of having a small class. The less amount of people the more power in it for students interestingly enough. You can backtalk and roast him back with few consequences.\n\nBtw having goals in mind for the classes you take is helpful. Figure out if you want to just pass with a high grade, learn the material, and/or want an engaging experience. Sometimes you will only get one out of those three so pick accordingly off reviews or luck of the draw.",

Unfortunately a small amount from the list of these are ones you\u2019ll see your first semester, but hopefully this will be a good reference for the future. This is just my opinion so make sure to do your own research with rate my professor.\n\nAdvice:\n- Make friends! Study buddies make the miserable times a little less miserable. Be prepared to do a lot of learning on your own and with classmates. \n- Try to join clubs if you can! Unfortunately I had to work a lot to pay for tuition so I couldn\u2019t join many, but looking back I wish I did.\n- CSULB has a lot to offer. Don\u2019t forget to have fun! A lot of students in the MAE department are commuters so they come to class and go home. Try staying on campus, go to the gym (it\u2019s super nice), go to the Japanese garden, the library, the outpost, the nugget, the union. There\u2019s a lot to do, don\u2019t let MAE consume all of your time.\n- Try not to let school dictate your emotions. Learn to compartmentalize school and other things going on in your life.\n- I was very fortunate to graduate in 4 yrs but that\u2019s not always the case. Be prepared for 4.5 or 5. Even if you have AP credits definitely try to take GE courses over the summers! It\u2019s going to be tough, there might be times you want to give up, but you can do it! Have goals and remind yourself why you\u2019re doing this!\n\nDifficult Professors:\nMartin Tong - MAE 476, MAE 376, MAE 305\nVu - MAE 272\nKhattab - MAE 333\n\nGood professors:\nDonna Russo - Calc I\nLeslie Rodriguez - Calc II\nConner Whelan - Applied Math\nShahab Taherian - MAE 490A\nJeremy Redman - Statics (don\u2019t remember course number)\nBrian Ruhe - MAE 205\nEhsan Madadi - MAE 330\nAndres Acosta - CE 333 \nAsieh Jalali-Farahani- MAE 333\nJohn Hsu - MAE 336, MAE 431\nChang Kim - MAE 305\nRezvan Ramezani - MAE 459\n\nOk professors:\nDan Hernandez - Calc III\nAllen Teagle - A lot of courses (not the best teacher but if you try you\u2019ll pass)\nHuy Hoang - MAE 300\nTariq Shahab - CE 406\n\nBest of luck to you! These next few years will definitely be something lol. Feel free to dm me if you have any more specific questions or want advice! If I can do it, you can do it! :)",

I don't remember much about them but use all the resources you can get.Hoenstly any interaction i had with advisors at the school was mostly how fast can we get you out of here \ud83d\ude43. Advisors seemed more like people that would check up on you to see if your getting stuff done and turning in paper work. If you ask about classes honestly they're clueless lol. Older students are better at giving advise and the advisors are the ones determining whether they'll let you do the class schedules or degree programs.",

Now, there are (some) people where it clicks well, but the class average for this class is in the 40s-mid 50s range. Thermo, really depends on the professor tbh. \n\nFor 272, some say that Vu is tolerable (if even that)...I say, why spend for tolerable when you can get better (I mean unless you really need that class out of the way); try to get that one online section with Yavari or try 272 in the summer with Mahdi (dude's a Gigachad ngl, awesome professor!)\n\n Haven't taken Dynamics or Fluids yet, but heard those classes are pretty difficult, take the CE version of fluids if you can wince it counts just as much as the MAE version. \n\nThat's about all I have to say, good luck! \n\nP.S Another word of advice is to get to know and network with your classmates, it will pay in spades!",

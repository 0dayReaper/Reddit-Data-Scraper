            "comment": "Going to be honest here, quality on graduation gowns is typically crap because they\u2019re not clothing items that are meant to last for very long. Usually, theyre poorly sewn and the printing is very \u2018cheap\u2019 quality.The idea behind their poor quality construction is to save money, they\u2019re only worn for a couple hours, at most before being tossed or stored away.\n\nUnless you\u2019re doing a really up-close photography session, very likely no one will notice the fine details of the gown.\n\nIf returning it isn\u2019t an option, maybe do a fun DIY to fix it? Lots of fabric pen options at Michaels and Art Supply Warehouse in Westminster is epic, staff members would definitely be able to guide you in fixing the details.",

The campus is basically falling apart, several building don't even have AC. Best of luck to all the incoming transfers.",

On the CSULB campus I\u2019m still figuring out comfortable places so it\u2019s nice to have a place to fall back to when I need to disappear into a room to study for hours at a time.\n\nIn short, I have a very good study routine that I wouldn\u2019t have if I went to a university farther away, and since I\u2019m planning on grad school and a PhD eventually, WHERE I get my undergrad degree isn\u2019t something I was terribly picky about.

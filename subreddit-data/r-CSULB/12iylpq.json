    "postText": "I was accepted as a transfer student for Fall 2023 in the Cinema Theory and Practice major, but I decided I wanted to change my major to English (I have already completed all my IEGTC requirements + 60 units, including taking English 101, 102, and 103 at my community college, if that helps at all). I know it\u2019s impossible to change my major prior to the Fall semester, but will it be possible to change to English once classes start? I have been emailing with advising and they are making it seem like it\u2019s not possible to change majors at all as a transfer student.",

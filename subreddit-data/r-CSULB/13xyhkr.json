I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s changed? Also, so my contribution isn\u2019t 5,000 and my parents don\u2019t contribute to my schooling so what can be done about this??",

You can check this at the Web Grants 4 Students site.\n\nAs far as getting your aid adjusted, it is not about your parents contributing to your schooling specifically, but furthermore, you will only be considered independent in the eyes of financial aid if you 1) are age 24 or older, 2) are married, or 3) have a child. Other exceptions are made for specific situations like being an emancipated minor and other things, but it does not seem those things apply here.",

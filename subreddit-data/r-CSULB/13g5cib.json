(I believe they are all free now because there is a shortage of teachers. plus you can do them online, proctored of course). Also, become a sub! Anyone with a degree, 2.75 gpa and pass the test can be a sub. (25/hour). Next you need to get your teaching credentials. Depending on what kind of teacher you want to be you may be able to do it online fully or do it at any cal state. (Check the state teaching site to see which schools they approve. I know many people go to the degree mill sites because you can get your teaching credentials in weeks. I wouldn't do that though! Just go to a cal states, most programs are only a year.) While you are in school they will require you to teach a class but thats free. I heard getting your teaching credentials is time consuming because you are a student teacher all day but you should be done in a year.",

                    "comment": "Agreed, and just some points of clarification for OP:\n\nThe tests you'll need are the CBEST (basic skills) and CSET (subject mastery). Elementary teachers need an additional test, the RICA. These are all free but only until June 30th. Also check if you even need them, as coursework and past test scores could potentially exempt you from one or more. \n\nMost programs I'm aware of are 3 semesters: 2 semesters of classes + 1 semester of student teaching. Student teaching is basically you teaching part time every day in a semester, under the guidance and supervision of an established teacher. This is time intensive since you not only have to teach, but also lesson plan, grade, and complete the CalTPAs - basically a semester-long final exam to get your preliminary credential (this is graded by the state). You definitely won't have time to work for any more than a few hours per week this semester. It sucks butt, but this is basically an apprenticeship that you're not only not paid for, but that you pay to do (since you still have to pay tuition that semester). Luckily, financial aid is still available. Expect a similar award package as your undergrad. CA also has the (conditional) Golden State Teacher Grant and other teacher-specific forms of aid which can give you additional funds. \n\nAnd yes, substitute teach to get a feel for it. The current daily rate in LBUSD is $198 ($32/hr for 6 hours), and surrounding districts are in the same ballpark.",

(From my experience)\n\nIt\u2019s a really difficult job in certain schools\u2026 BUT you get to have a sense and feel in what school you would like to work with. (You seriously would see a complete difference in curriculum, philosophy, behavioral management, staff (if they are short(i noticed it meant the job is easier to get into and have more work besides being a teacher) or not), and more. \n\nSometimes! You will come as a teacher\u2019s assistant and learn classroom management skills. Everything you learn on book will present how it works. Talk to the teacher about how the school is. Don\u2019t tell them you are trying to be a teacher! They will just flatter the school instead of telling you the real deets",

            "comment": "Hi! To simplify what you need to do:\n\n\\- take a CSET exam in the subject you want to teach. You need to decide if you want to do elementary (multi-subject credential), or secondary/high school (a single-subject credential). (This part takes anywhere from 3 months to a year depending on when the exam is scheduled next)\n\n\\- after passing the CSET exam, you need to go back to school and take a methodology course in that subject. (Takes one semester)\n\n\\- apply to CPIE, have the Credential Verified through CTC (costs $100, takes about 40 days).\n\nThen join the rest of us on EdJoin and compete to get an interview. I have two credentials, still waiting for the jobs to be posted\u2026",

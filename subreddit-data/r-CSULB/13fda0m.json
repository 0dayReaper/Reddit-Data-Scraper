I had tried to get one while simultaneously trying to get proof of disability and because I didn't have it at the time of applying I had no luck.\n\nI even called a few different places when I was assigned a double to see if there was ANY way to get a single at all - everywhere told me to register for the BMAC which I didn't qualify for at the time\n\nTLDR: if the reason for wanting a single is purely because you don't want a roommate - you're out of luck :(",

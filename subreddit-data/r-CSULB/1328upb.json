Their auto flush system really sucks and people aren\u2019t checking to see if it actually flushed. I checked 6 stalls before I found a clean one. So please make sure it flushes all the way (it probably won\u2019t) so if it doesn\u2019t manually flush it you have to hold it until all of it goes down.",

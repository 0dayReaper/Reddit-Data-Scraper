I just graduated with my BA from CSUDH so it was easy for me to just go back. Has anyone had to weigh this option? Has anyone done the MSW program at CSUDH? Or CSULB? Im a first gen, I don't know anyone who has been to grad school much less have this dilemma. I didn't think I would get in so I don't know what to do anymore. Im a standard 25 mins away from CSULB vs 5 mins from CSUDH. I don't know the campus or drive. I just want the best education and program for a great post degree job as well. Thank you in advance!!!",

My main thing would also be the commute to LB is much much further to where I may need to relocate. Sigh let me know how you narrow it down!",

Every week we gonna have one lab, and the lab gonna due next week lab day. The day you submit it, we gonna have that weekly little tiny daily quiz (3 questions include 1 free response, 1 fill in the blank, 1 multiple choice). For his midterm and final, he always have a mini quiz for student to review first, then big one (separate days not together). His hw is just finish the lab, nothing else. I think people said his lab is tedious because the instructions is confusing and complex. However, if not clear just ask instructor Max and he always willing to help students.  \nP/s: I try to type this real fast so if confuse some part. lets me know",

I did take the S/I for his class though which was a lifesaver bc I can't study on my own. There were weekly quizzes/writing prompts (wasn't every single week, but it was pretty regular) that were done in person at first and then he switched to online versions so it was super easy. The discord was helpful with these. He's been offering extra credit too which are just making a short video explaining a concept (no need to show your face). I'm not a huge fan of his lecture style bc it feels a bit unnecessarily dramatic? Like he pauses a lot for emphasis and stuff, but it's just a mild annoyance and doesn't actually affect the lecture that bad. He's a good guy, and he'll answer questions without making you feel stupid.\n\nDidn't take him for lab, not too sure if his lecture exams are considered hard, but it's mostly MCQ (about 45 or so questions) with 3 FRQ at the end. He gives you about 7 FRQs to practice before the exam, and will pick 3 to use for the exam, so if you do those in advance and study them, you're set. 2/3 of the FRQs on the exam are mandatory, the 3rd one is 10 pts extra credit on the exam (optional, but I always do them anyway).\n\nHope you get into all the classes you wanted :\\]",

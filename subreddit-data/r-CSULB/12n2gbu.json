    "postText": "Did they check for the sticker on your ID this year? Me and my roommate are possibly getting apartments that are right next to beachside and it would be awesome if we could use the shuttle to and from.\n\nI searched Reddit and I found people saying sometimes they check and they let you on if it\u2019s not full (they allow beachside residents first) and others saying they don\u2019t check.\n\nAlso something about a shuttle called Los Coyotes? Is that gone, I\u2019ve never heard of it until now",

However in the spring I think they changed it to beachside residents only (i could be wrong, so correct me if I am) \n\nSometimes they check for stickers and sometimes they don't. It's pretty hit or miss and depends on the driver. \n\nI have no idea what the Los coyote shuttle is",

Just depends on the driver, just watch the flow of people during the first few weeks, imo.",

You can look at routes on bus stops or online sometimes and figure out what buses will take you where. You can also ask the bud driver and they usually have some literature you can go through to help you figure it out. It isn\u2019t as difficult as you would think too, I wasn\u2019t experienced riding the bus but figured it out in about an hour tbh.",

How are y'all getting by? do you have to work more than one job or have you found good deals. let me know your personal experiences!",

From my experience, apartments always ran a bit more than a room out of a house. I transferred to CSULB, but during my CC years I saved most of my financial aid. So by the time I got to CSULB, working part time was enough to cover my costs.",

Live for free, save the money that would have gone to rent, get your degree, and then, when you get your first job that pays decently? Then move out.  \n\n\nRIght now you have cushion. YOu arent worried about bills. Hold onto that, get your degree, then get out.",

So that\u2019s a huge help.\n2. I live with three other roommates in a house and am on food stamps. HUGE saver on rent and groceries. \n3. I apply for all relevant scholarships and grants. \n4. I\u2019m naturally frugal due to living far below the poverty line my entire childhood and adult life. \n5. When all else fails, I sell my clothes/belongings and take out subsidized loans for school.",

            "comment": "Hi there, in terms of pricing for apartments I found that a single private room with a shared bath usually will run you about $750+, sometimes lower if you find a good deal, but for a standard private room it's about that price. I know that in apartments they run a little higher vs. a house where there's more people to split the cost. If you share a room with somebody, it will obviously be cheaper. I make about $30/hr at my internship with more hours so I'm not the best person to give advice, but I know my roommate works a server job with good tips and an office job to afford her rent and other living costs. Based on your hourly wage + hours, I would recommend finding a side job if you really want to move out or finding a roommate to split the costs of a room with you. Also, sometimes houses in other cities out of LB are cheaper and you would just have to commute a bit to school. Good luck on your search and moving out :D",

            "comment": "Everyone\u2019s input on your question is so on point and that\u2019s really the reality of living around in this area especially if you\u2019re going to college. The majority of students live with family or even friends since it\u2019s how adults and even young adults get by while trying to better themselves to one day be able to afford to live in such an expensive state. \n\nPersonally, I live with my dad even still after graduating from CSULB from their business school since landing a decent career the last couple of years hasn\u2019t been the easiest for most of us. I will say the friends I know who did what you\u2019re doing say was a real experience for them since they basically had to share a room with a guy and a bathroom with three other dudes so regardless it\u2019s going to feel like living in a dorm since jobs that most college students can get are minimum wage and can\u2019t work a lot since you have to balance it out with your school work and other personal life matters so there\u2019s no secret on how anyone does it Since you want your own room you\u2019re going to have to look into renting a room out from someone\u2019s house but just really look into and research who and where these places are. Also really take advantage of everything CSULB offers with meals and any sort of financial aid of any kind from housing to tuition. \n\nOn a side note, I really give you a lot of credit for what you\u2019re doing since I can imagine how hard and even a bit anxious it can be trying to do it all. All I got to say is if you don\u2019t know any friends that you can live with don\u2019t be shy of getting involved with clubs or getting know people and finding out if anyone is looking to rent or be roommates. I really do hope you find a comfortable living situation that you\u2019re looking for.",

If you\u2019re new to it, a work schedule, a school schedule, and the rigors of living on your own for the first time will compound on you, and all facets of your life can suffer for it",

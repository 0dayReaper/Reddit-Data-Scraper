You also get like a 20% discount on things on campus like food, also I think there are textbook discounts. Was definitely good for the time I did it bc I didn\u2019t have a car.",

I\u2019m a computer science major, and I never actually bought physical books, but I believe there\u2019s a 20% or 30% discount at the bookstore for textbooks as long as you show it\u2019s for a class you have scheduled (they don\u2019t want you to abuse this friends). Everything at the bookstore should be 20% off tho. This is for Forty-Niner Shop employees, which is the dining halls, The Nugget, The Outpost, bookstore, I think that fake Starbucks thing in the library, and the convenience stores. There were always a lot of international students bc it\u2019s one of the few jobs you can get on a student visa. You can find [open positions at this link](https://workforcenow.adp.com/mascsr/default/mdf/recruitment/recruitment.html?cid=354c5317-250f-48b6-9cdc-fba106d1e6f9&amp;ccId=19000101_000001&amp;type=JS&amp;lang=en_US). There aren\u2019t many positions open right now, looks like just one for bookstore, but generally in July/August a lot will open up in prep for the new semester.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, what did I do. I worked there for like 3 years, and that was during COVID as well, so I worked at each dining hall for a bit. Most of the time I was just in the dish room washing dishes, which they pretty much only put guys at. It\u2019s prob the worst thing, but during the height of COVID it was fine bc everyone else would be super bored since no one would come lol. But otherwise you might be serving food, restocking things, basic cleaning, things like that. Nothing super exciting but it\u2019s honest work haha. The best thing about it was that, since you\u2019re all students, you fill out availability before each semester, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them scheduling you during class, and you\u2019ll pretty much have a consistent schedule the whole semester. Also you just eat whatever on break.",

If you're ok/good at talking with people, can be fun. Rockwall held trips over the weekends so there are times where you could get paid to hike, paddleboard, or camp for example. The camping trips you basically make bank due to the massive overtime you got. You almost always make some OT on the outdoor trips.",

Depending on the type of shift I either do tasks like opening/closing the building, turning on escalators (when they work lol), putting up the flag, etc. We also do AV setups for events that go on in the building, so we typically set up speakers and mics and things like that. Overall we\u2019re just in charge of maintaining the safety of the building and of students/guests that come in.\n\nPersonally its been a great experience, Ive made a lot of close connections and my coworkers are chill. They really make the job enjoyable. \n\nI definitely recommend applying either now or over the summer. We typically see a lot of hiring being down towards the end of the semester or during breaks when graduating seniors are leaving.",

I just can\u2019t find it in me to drive all way over there to deposit money and do everything else. I\u2019m currently a student but will be graduating soon(idk if that matters when banking with them)",

Also able to use atms at 7 eleven and stuff to withdraw/deposit so that\u2019ll probably be helpful for u! Def recommend &lt;3",

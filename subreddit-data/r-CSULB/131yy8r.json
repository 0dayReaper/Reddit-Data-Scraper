    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have been for the past few months debating about going to CSULB or CPP for CS. At first I had chosen CPP because of all the weird things I heard about the cs program at CSULB, but all Fall classes still available at CPP only have badly (like, really bad) rated professors.\nSo I am considering CSULB again, my question is:\nDid the program got any better? It looks like there\u2019s way more classes and professors available than CPP.\nWhat do you guys expect for the Fall 2023 semester?\n\nTechnically Long Beach would be better for me since it\u2019s closer, but I would rather make sure the program is solid or getting better before I enroll! Thank you!",

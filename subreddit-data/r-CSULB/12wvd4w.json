I really need help making a decision \n\nI got admitted as a freshman for marine science, and im debating between CSULB and CSUMB. I come from a pretty populated/well known city, so LB feels like home, which I want since I get homesick easily. I have a pro and con list which i\u2019ve been thinking about forever, and it\u2019s impossible for me to make a decision. I\u2019d really appreciate your guys\u2019 thoughts and input!!!\n\npros\n- extremely convenient city, everything is there\n- close to home (for me)\n- the dorms are so nice compared to CSUMB\n- diverse student body\n- ive heard that the people who go there enjoy it \n- if the cafeteria food is bad, i could easily get food from a restaurant in the city\n\ncons\n- i havent heard much about the marine bio program\n- extremely big student population, so im assuming its hard to build personal relationships with professors. im also assuming its hard to get the classes you want\n- the campus is So. Damn. Big. and i hate walking. i might invest in roller skates\n- parking. i heard you have to pay $10-12? \n- housing isnt guaranteed and super competitive \n\nIf you want to tell me any of your experiences with going here more in depth, feel free to dm me! id appreciate it so so much. Thank you!!",

Dining hall food isn\u2019t bad and there are literally dozens of restaurants within a 5 minute drive. Also- it\u2019s not as hard to connect with professors as you might think. Once you\u2019re in your 200s-300 level classes, often you\u2019ll be in classes of 20 students or less, which makes the class more intimate. If you want to connect with a professor who only does large lecture halls, just attend office hours. They\u2019re almost always happy to chat. Housing isn\u2019t guaranteed but there\u2019s so many apartments nearby that it\u2019s a guarantee you\u2019ll find somewhere to stay, most likely cheaper than dorms if you\u2019re willing to share a room",

It seems like you have an opportunity for a [semester at Santa Catalina island](https://www.csulb.edu/biological-sciences/marine-biology/catalina-semester) for marine bio students.\n\nParking can get expensive here around $210/semester and they're increasing it every school year for the next 5 years. This is common for schools with a large population tho. I personally always manage to find parking most of the time, you'll learn where the empty spots are after a few months here. There are shuttles that can take you around but I enjoy walking. I've seen people use skateboards and bikes for the most part of campus too.\n\nYou can easily get food on campus. Besides the school dining places there are Sbarro, Subway, Starbucks/coffee bean, el Pollo loco, Carl's jr right on campus\n\nI don't have any experience with housing on campus but from what I've heard, you're better off renting off campus if you decide to move nearer to LB.",

Lot's of different clubs and organization to join that are related and great funding (i think). \n\nWith personal relationships, yes LB is big and many people go to class and dip but the social life is what you make out of it. There are plenty of people who developed great relationships with peers and professors. For the classes if you are on time for enrollment day and do it early, you can guarantee the classes. Just don't procrastinate on the date. \n\nCampus being big and walking a lot is for every school out there, not just LB. Skates are a good idea if you're good with them. Also, lots of busses that get you to the upperside. \n\nHousing can be difficult. I haven't dormed at all in LB so I don't really know anything on this subject. For parking, if you plan to dorm, I don't think you'll need parking",

When you get to upper division classes, most electives are usually under 50, so it\u2019s not too hard to build personal relationships with peers and professors. Also, most classes for your major would be in the same building or around, so not too much walking required, and I would recommend online GEs for the sake of time and to not walk so much. \nYeah parking sucks, can\u2019t really get away from it, it is like $250+ a semester, but LB does have a good transportation system, and if you leave nearby, it shouldn\u2019t be so bad.",

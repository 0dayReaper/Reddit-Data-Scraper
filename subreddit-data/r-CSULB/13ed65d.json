What kind of expenses should I be expecting? Rent? Groceries? Transportation? Utilities? And so on\u2026 If you have any advice in general I would also greatly appreciate that!",

            "comment": "Welcome! CSULB is considered a school that isn\u2019t as expensive as other CSU\u2019s (well, this is what I hear). If you\u2019ve been fully covered by fafsa thus far, no fear, if your financial situation hasn\u2019t increased, then you\u2019ll be fully covered here. Csulb also has scholarship applications, with the general application being fairly easy to complete, and a major specific application process as well for major specific scholarships. Here\u2019s a breakdown on actual prices, each semester was around 3k, well for me anyway, which would mean 6k a year. If you\u2019re taking summer classes, they\u2019ll be 1k+, fafsa can only cover a portion of summer classes expenses, if you can take them at a cc then do so! The parking permit is 250$ a semester or 500$ for a year, however I believe they\u2019ll be freezing parking permit prices for the next upcoming semester or year of 2024, not sure of the specifics on that. I commuted from LA to CSULB for 4 days a week with a 6 cylinder (meaning it just wastes gas), and I would use 50$ every week for gas, I aimed to put it every Thursday. A Walmart gas was on my way home and it\u2019s incredibly cheaper than most areas so that helped a ton. If you\u2019re struggling with food, every college student qualifies for EBT, I\u2019ve had friends receive 300$+ a month, don\u2019t miss if you need it! If you\u2019re struggling with other expenses and are in an emergency crisis, csulb has a basic needs services where you can apply for emergency aid, you\u2019ll have to show proof of a bill or whatever May strain you in order to receive aid, it\u2019s about max 1k. I believe they also have medical bill aid as well, incase a medical crisis comes up and you can\u2019t pay off the bill, again, you\u2019ll need proof. If you can\u2019t apply for EBT and need food, csulb has a beach pantry where you can get free food. Hope this helps!",

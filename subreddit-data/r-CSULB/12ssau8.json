    "postText": "I've been very conflicted regarding my enrollment as after looking more into the CS department of CSULB, most students highly suggested to not come here as a comp sci major. \n\nOther than CSULB I've been accepted into Purdue, U of Minn and UIC but all those unis seem highly out of my financial reach.\n\nThe only other realistic option I have seems to be to go to a fairly unknown art college named The College of Wooster for BA in comp sci as I've been awarded financial aid there. \n\nIt'd be great if any current cs major could help me out regarding my decision.",

I made sure to take teachers who had good ratings on RMP, but also I was a shit student, and I made the most of my learning getting my shit together and putting in lots of efforts for classes I was struggling in. \n\nMake the most of your time at CSULB, but know that if you come here you\u2019ll be fine if you work hard. Good luck!",

Their 2020-2021 CS graduating class size was 10, which suggests that you may not receive as much focus if you went to any other school.",

It's a statistical risk, especially in slow to change industries. I also know people with CS BAs in those positions: when I've asked about that, their advice is to get a BS every time. Thankfully, Long Beach didn't cop out by offering only a BA, which gives its own negative perception for program quality, regardless of actuality.",

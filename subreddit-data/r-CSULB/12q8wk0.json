It's just straight weekly quizzes, couple of diagnostic exams (think tests every 3-4 weeks that make sure you're getting the material), a midterm, and a final. That's literally all your grade is based on. Miss anything? Out of luck. There goes 3-10%% of your grade. If you're on top of everything, the class will be a breeze. If not, you will have to ask many questions and attend office hours. On the bright side, he also posts online lectures so technically going to class isn't necessary but extremely helpful. I have like 80 iq so I go to class AND review his lectures online. The one textbook he mandated was not necessary at all since he posts his lectures online with a decent amount of examples. I never once looked in it. I think Wright is an okay guy who is really helpful if you ask for it.",

I'm already pretty familiar with symbolic logic so I just wanna see what I might need to brush up on. Gotta make sure this class is a breeze since I am taking harder ones along with it.",

If you like symbolic logic then the class will be easy. I wouldn't say it's hard but if you fall behind for 1-2 weeks, it will snowball into a catastrophe. I'm taking this as my last philosophy class before graduating with a bachelors in philosophy. I wouldn't say the workload is crazy but I'm def glad I'm taking this class with only 2 other courses this semester. (non-Phil UD classes)",

But then again, maybe that's because phil 160 was just an easier class compared to the other classes he teaches. \n\nAlso fs!",

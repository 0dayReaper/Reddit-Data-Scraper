            "comment": "I graduated from CSULB with an anthropology degree (archeology focus). One of the things I learned about is Puvungna. \n\nBasically, Puvungna is a holy site where certain tribes believe humans were created. It is also full of artifacts and human remains. The problem with disturbing the land is that it will likely end up destroying some of these artifacts and remains. \n\nLocal trial leaders from Tongva, Chumash, etc... have tried to come to an agreement to have trusted archeologists work alongside people from the school to make sure that nothing is destroy, and so that the human remains can be buried elsewhere (the people can not be at peace unless they are buried). \n\nProblem for the school is that this would take a very long time and lots more money than just digging up the soil. Legally, they have to hire archeologists for NAGPRA, but from what I've heard they are trying to hire a shady company to get it done faster and cheaper. The local tribes can't really do much about it because they are not federally recognized.\n\nI've also heard that the school is thinking about adding another parking lot up there, which would obviously be very destructive. With the last parking lot they built, they found tons of human remains, which are still being cataloged to this day. \n\nSo basically what it comes down to is the school is greedy and impatient.",

That is absolutely awful and honestly really rubs me the wrong way as an Indigenous student. Especially if they are using the federal/state tribal recognition.",

Also my Professor was under the impression Puvungs would be left untouched by the school until Monday so this plan seems very rushed. \n\nThe plan includes having a sprinker/watering system put out there for flowers. Native flowers don't bloom in fall/winter yet that is when they are planned to be planted. Native plants all but die back in winter and are drought tolerant so I doubt the contractors will even use Native plants. \n\nI just want Puvunga to be left alone.\n\nEdit spelling",

CSULB doesn't exactly have a history of operating in good faith when it comes to Puvungna.\n\nThere is an onsite teach-in on the 30th (Sunday) at 9:30am for anyone interested in learning more.",

They even planned to build a strip mall over it for instance. \n\nIn 2019, CSULB dumped a bunch of trash/dirt onto the remaining land to build the parking lot and I believe some of the dorm buildings? Our \u2018esteemed\u2019 president pretty much shrugged the whole thing off. \n\nCSULB pretty much retains a stance of like a \u201cbenevolent protector\u201d, which arguably is quite an imperialist way of thinking. CSULB should probably just give back the rest of the remaining land but they likely won\u2019t atleast under the current president",

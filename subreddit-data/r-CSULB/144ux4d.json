If I could go back, I would probably go after a hard science degree. I say this because you can work in the lab (if you go out to the field and decide you dont like that) AND because if you go into this field and realize this isn\u2019t what you want (many people realize they cant handle the gory stuff) then you have a degree in science and can fall back on a different career path. I would also say it makes you stand out because most people (like myself) just go after a CJ degree. If you have a bio/chem degree, you know more than CJ.",

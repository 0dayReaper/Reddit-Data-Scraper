The school of art sent out a long list of our concerns and she just blew us off and only came around us on the condition that we wouldn't protest or bring it up, which will never not stop being funny to me",

Instead of focusing on things that would help the students and faculty, there was a lot of money spent on vanity/publicity projects. The GO BEACH letters near the fountain cost an absurd amount of money. \n \nBasically, everything she did was very tone deaf and no one ever got the feeling that she was ever doing what was best for the school or community.",

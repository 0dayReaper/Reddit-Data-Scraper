I'm trying to get an idea of what the living expenses are so I can budget accordingly.\n\nI'm interested in the following expenses for one person:\n\n* Rent\n* Food\n* Transportation\n\nHow much do on-campus jobs generally pay/month and how hard is it to get them?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

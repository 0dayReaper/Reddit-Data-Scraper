I thought that sc\u2019s cs program was great, though it\u2019s been several years and I think they combined CS and CE into one degree now. Most people are really serious about it so definitely not an easy program to go through. I don\u2019t know how Lb\u2019s program fares though. \nI loved that sc was right up against a state park and a bus ride to the beach- walking in the redwoods while it\u2019s foggy to the library was amazing. Other than nature stuff there\u2019s not a ton to do outside of college parties and hang out downtown unless you\u2019re able to get a car and go to San Jose. \nHousing is really difficult in SC. Rent is ridiculous on and off campus as well as super competitive since most students live in town and there\u2019s not that many close cities to commute from. \nIf cost isn\u2019t an major issue I would choose UCSC.",

I'm not saying you shouldn't attend if you really want to but I feel like most people end up choosing UC just because of the name when they don't really want go there. I have take classes at LBCC, CSULB, and UCLA ( my alma mater). THE BEST PROFESSORS I'VE EVER HAD EVER WAS AT LBCC. Followed by CSULB and finally UCLA. The quality of instruction at LBCC is miles above any UC imo. At UC expect to teach yourself a lot, but if you're the kind of person who needs a little bit of guidance choose CSULB. Ultimately, it's your decision. If you have any questions please ask.",

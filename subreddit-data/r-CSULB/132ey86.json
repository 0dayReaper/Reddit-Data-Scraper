            "comment": "I\u2019ve actually taken the classes with both professors and I\u2019ve honestly preferred Calabrese over Redman. Professor Calabrese goes over the material slowly while ensuring everyone is able to follow along. One major thing to note though is that Professor Redman usually doesn\u2019t do homework for grade. When Redman assigns homework, there\u2019s no point where you turn it in, it\u2019s more for you the student to use it as review, whereas the homework will be graded for Calabrese. Also Redman will likely have you purchase your textbook because he doesn\u2019t want to use the older editions(The class for Calabrese uses Engineering Mechanics: Statics 14th edition, which is available for download for free online, whereas redman will have you using the 15th edition) I\u2019ve used both textbooks and there was trully no distinguishable difference between them aside from like 4 questions, but redman wants everyone to use the newest version.",

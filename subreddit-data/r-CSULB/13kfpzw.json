Plus, grades are submitted by class, so if a couple, or even one, classmate asks for some sort of last-minute extension or make-up assignment or a BMAC student has an extension accommodation, the whole classes\u2019s grades wait for everything to be submitted.\n\nDon\u2019t worry. Everything will get sorted out by tomorrow. Professors know students are anxious about final grades, especially those who are graduating. They\u2019re on top of it! If your final grade isn\u2019t posted by Friday morning, contact your professor.",

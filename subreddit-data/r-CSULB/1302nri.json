    "postText": "Hello ! I am trying if to decide between UCR and CSULB. I got accepted to lb for biomedical engineering and ucr for neuroscience. I kinda of despise the location of ucr but don\u2019t know if lb is worth the drive. If anyone has any insight on the biomed program at lb and if anyone has also done premed with this major pls let me know. Thanks!",

Like apply for jobs, they know what accreditation is, so if they say graduated in an [accredited engineerin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/electrical-engineer-medical-devices-at-ul-solutions-3574103078)g program with a b.s., you might not make it. You can see CSULB is very careful to word it to sound like it's [accredited](http://catalog.csulb.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=8&amp;poid=3719&amp;print), but it's [not](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/ee-accreditation).",

I notice there is an \"Accreditation\" section prominently placed on the main Biomed page, but when you click it merely states program objectives - which conspicuously make **no mention of accreditation** at all!  \n\nI wonder how many students have completed this program not knowing this...\n\nhttps://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/biomedical-engineering",

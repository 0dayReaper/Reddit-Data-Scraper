I would love to do simple tattoos from april25-may4 12-8. Dm me with a specific date and time along with a reference of what you would like to get tatted. Eventually I would love to do realism.",

I have one solid idea but if that isn\u2019t feasible I would still love to help out and give out skin to work on!",

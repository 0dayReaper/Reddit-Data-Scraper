    "postText": "So I just got an email today that my offer has been rescinded, I don't have 2 of my classes that I need. Which is engr 10 and cis 28, the thing is cis28 isn't offered at my school during spring. I also was thinking of taking engr 10 over the summer but it seems like it needs to be completed before summer. I'm pretty scared and confused right now and don't know what to do. I already contacted admissions and sent a ticket and booked an appointment. Can anyone share their thoughts on what to do??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: \n\nAfter the ticket submission apparently they couldn't verify that I took Calculus 1 so im going to send an appeal for this.",

Contact them and tell them, personal problems came up and that you had to shift the classes to summer, but you're been enrolled in both and will finish before fall.",

But if they already withdrew the offer you may be outta luck. Tho outside circumstances may be considered if you have good documentation especially if you communicated your concerns in writing either with csulb or a guidance counselor at your community college.",

    "postText": "hi everyone, i am currently provisionally accepted at csulb as a transfer student for fall 2023. I have completed 60 units and my 4 GEs. I was looking at the major specific requirements for my major (kinesiology - physical education) and I have completed and passed 2 of them but I have not completed one of them which is phisiology. I reported on my supplemental application that I was going to take it in the summer, but final transcripts are due now. am i going to get my admission rescinded because of this?",

Thankfully I did complete all the required courses, but I didn't like how they flat out told me my admission would be rescinded, just that, no other options or anything.",

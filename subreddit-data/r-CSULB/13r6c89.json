    "postText": "I'm looking for some insight on the art education program. What are the classes like / what do you do in them? I feel like the course descriptions are really vague, and most of them have \"TBA\" professors, or those whose names don't show up on ratemyprofessors. Also, when should I the EDSS 300 course, and how intense is it? I appreciate anything you can share!",

            "comment": "The courses don\u2019t have instructors listed just yet because there is a new professor hired and they are rearranging classes! But the names should be on them soon.  \n\nAll of the classes will have some kind of lesson planning exercises that teach you how to plan great lessons for elementary, middle and high school students, and each class also focuses on a different aspect of teaching; understanding cultural backgrounds, technology, materials, contemporary issues, etc.  \n\nThe EDSS classes are transitioning into the credential- take EDSS300a in your junior year or senior year.  It has a lot of tasks that help you meet the licensure requirements-testing, fingerprinting, getting field experience by doing observations and assisting in K12 classrooms. \n\nThe coordinator for the art credential program has summer info meetings-reach out to Brian Trimble and he\u2019ll get you set up!",

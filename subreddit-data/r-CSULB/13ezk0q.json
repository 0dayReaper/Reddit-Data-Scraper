    "postText": "I hate how they don't announce who's teaching the class until later. Anyways, I ended up getting Goldstein. I hear that he's a pretty terrible professor, so I'm trying to see if there's any way I can avoid him.\n\nThe only two professors teaching this course (CECS 328) in the fall are Sharifian and Goldstein, but Sharifian has less than stellar reviews too. Which is the best between the two, or am I better off trying my luck next semester? I'm not trying to fail a class because of a bad professor.\n\nIf they're both terrible, then I'll probably swap this class with BIOL 200.",

Goldstein made a power move a couple semesters ago to \u201cstandardize\u201d 328 so it wasn\u2019t all over the place and now I believe Sharafian teaches and assigns the same assignments/projects. Might as well go with Goldstein. I hated that class but if you just try to go in with an open mind he\u2019s a good professor it\u2019s just the assignments are ass.  DM if you want more details. If I can pass you can pass.",

    "postText": "Due to certain circumstances I had to drop linear algebra and calculus 3 at my community college. I\u2019m hoping to request an EW. I was wondering if either of these maths are both a pre requisite or a major requirement that I might have to take later on campus or not? I\u2019m planning to see if I can take it over summer at another college instead. \n\nI\u2019m super scared if I\u2019ll get a cancelled offer after getting accepted for Fall 2023. I talked to one student who read the booklet that it\u2019s mainly up to calculus 2; that\u2019s also what it says on assist. Not sure if it\u2019s true or not. I tried reaching out to advisors, but being left unanswered or told it\u2019s not right the contact - the website keeps leading me to saying the recent ones are on leave.",

I dropped linear algebra my last semester at community college and my offer did not get rescind . You will have to take CECS 229 which is basically linear Algebra and you won\u2019t need Calc 3 for any prerequisites. This last semester I took Numerical Methods and it had a bit of calc 3 but very basic stuff like partial derivatives.",

If I\u2019m not mistaken, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re for sure safe, as your admission was at least partially contingent on you completing your coursework.",

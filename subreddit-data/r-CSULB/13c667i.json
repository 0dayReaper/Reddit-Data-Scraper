    "postText": "So, I plan to stay on campus for 2 years straight (i am an international student if that helps fyi) and in order to do that, how many times do I have to apply for housing throughout the year excluding the summer term? I got the housing, just received the email actually BUT how long would i stay there without having to apply for housing again? or what are the timelines tho? I'd truly appreciate it cuz I am a little lost. Thanks! (edited: my term starts in Fall 2023 fyi)",

So if you\u2019re accepted, you\u2019re guaranteed a room from August until May (excluding winter break but you can pay $200 to stay for the month). You will reapply in April of next year for the next academic year",

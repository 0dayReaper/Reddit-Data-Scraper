    "postText": "Who is the easier professor Sally Chung\" or Steven Fisher as those are the only two options for that specific accounting class. I'm also planning to take another accounting class. Some students told me that  their counselor specifically told them not to take two accounting classes at the same time because they are already difficult as it is. So I am at a lost what I can do. I'm also planning to take IS310 at the same time.  Would that be too much? I don't know who would be the easiest for IS310 as I heard that most are not great professors. I was thinking to take Jacob Conlon or  Mohsen Sahebjame. Thanks for reading!",

I\u2019m considering transferring this fall and hoping to major in studio arts, and was hoping to get some feedback from those in the major or anyone who knows anything about it. \n\nHow was the program/classes/professors? How does the program hold up against other schools (my other csu option is CSUF)? Has the construction severely impacted the experience? Anything would help, thanks in advance!",

I'm kinda hesitant to bring it up because i don't wanna be dropped then I'll have to wait till spring to take this course. I was only about 10-15 minutes late on paying. How late was your payment that they ended up dropping you? I think I'll just keep an eye on my stuff and hope all is good. If anything though who would I email about this situation?",

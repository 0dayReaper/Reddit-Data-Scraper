    "postText": "I've heard the acceptance rate is pretty low for this school and also heavily dependent on your major... I really want to get into the Animation or Pre-Production tracks for CSULB and am trying to get a GPA of 3.5 or above to be considered more.\n\nI live in socal but not in the LB area.. I guess I'm just wondering, is it really as tough as they say? Is there anything I should look out for or work on that'll raise my chances of being accepted? Is it true that it's easier to be accepted as an AA-T first and THEN submitting a portfolio for BFA after you've sort of established yourself for a semester?\n\nSorry for all the questions!!! CSULB is the school I really need to get into and I would just be insanely grateful for any help I could get \ud83d\ude4f",

Everyone recommends you take a semester to establish yourself before applying but you don\u2019t have to do that. You can apply when you\u2019re applying to transfer. I got into the photo bfa as a transfer and a friend of mine got into the photo bfa as a transfer too. I even transferred in with an AA in photo. I just think it depends on the strength of your portfolio. You have to remember too that LB is one of those schools that everyone applies to for the art program because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get into other schools like ucla, cal arts, usc and so on. So getting into the bfa is competitive but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as difficult to get in as most would say it is.",

Yeah, I heard it's really competitive because of that which is what worried me initially \ud83d\ude1e \n\nAlso, sorry if this is a silly question but.. you can apply as an AA transfer and the BFA at the same time? If you don't get accepted for the BFA will they also just not accept your transfer?",

When you transfer, you\u2019ll be a studio art major and there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a studio art major, it\u2019s still a great pathway. But they don\u2019t recommend it because you only get two tries. Your admission won\u2019t be rescinded if you don\u2019t get into the bfa, you\u2019ll just be a studio art student. Another reason is because they want you to build your portfolio with stuff you make here at LB. I\u2019ll share some discord links with you on a couple different art servers. There\u2019s a lot of people in your discipline that will probably be able to answer more questions and even show you their portfolio submissions so you get an idea of what they\u2019re looking for.",

It will give you an idea of what pieces you should include more of or what pieces you can eliminate. \n\nI went in blind my first try in my second semester and wasn\u2019t accepted, the next shot next semester I emailed all the illustration professors what they thought of my portfolio and got some very helpful advice, and was accepted. \n\nIt\u2019s obviously not guaranteed that you\u2019ll be accepted but it\u2019s better to put your best foot forward, so they can\u2019t outright eliminate you based on you lacking the one thing everyone else has in their portfolio.",

I also believe a 3.5 gpa would give you good chances of getting accepted as a transfer. \n\nI have heard that a lot of people say that its better to just transfer in and then apply because you get to know the professors as well as ask about your portfolio and what you can do to improve it. I have heard about several rejections but at least if you get rejected you can ask questions and take a semester to rebuild a better portfolio with potentially the people that will be deciding if you make it in or not. \n\nIf you feel confident in your work then I would say just have 1 or 2 of your professors look over your portfolio if you want to apply to the BFA right away and see what they may suggest. Wishing you luck \ud83e\udee1",

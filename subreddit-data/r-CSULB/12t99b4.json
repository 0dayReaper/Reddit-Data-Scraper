    "postText": "Hi I'm a upcoming freshmen for CSULB for 2023 this fall, I'm just wondering what type of general ed classes are required for me to take, and what one of the classes I should take. I'm also planning to go for a BFA in animation here so I know I'll be in studio art for now before I submit my portfolio in the upcoming year, I'm wondering which classes from certain professors for animation should I take? Any advice or recommendation is welcomed, especially what to bring in my first year!",

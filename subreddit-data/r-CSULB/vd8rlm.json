I released soft enamel keychains for my other school designs, and also I recently released hard enamel keychains last week so it would be so dope to release a version of these!\n\nEdit: Which would be more popular amongst people, pins or keychains?",

As far as how long the sticker would last - all our stickers are completely waterproof and of thicker material so it should last you a long time. I think it would go great on your car. Hopefully you're not too worried about the size because it'll be 2\"x2\". I may do bigger sizes in the future, but it depends on how sales go for this one!\n\nAlso I think one guy who had my sticker had it since last year and it still held up to this day when he came back and showed me.",

Soft enamel looks like they forgot to fill in the entire well, which I guess they do except it\u2019s  intentional for the design!

I started off two years ago with Billy Bronco at Cal Poly and the success of it resulted in the creation of 80+ chibi billy stickers for each major. The question is would anyone be interested in having a chibi elbee representing their major? The goal is to expand products of him into keychains, charms, etc but I'm testing to see if people dig this design first \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou can also check out my work on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flippedimension/) and my [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1250196429/csulb-chibi-elbee-the-shark-vinyl-csulb?click_key=b30117e3524231433181a40421052647668a987c%3A1250196429&amp;click_sum=5d3866c8&amp;ref=shop_home_active_10&amp;frs=1) where the this sticker is now live to get a glimpse of what we have!",

            "comment": "I'm taking Biol207 lecture SI and lab SI right now\n\nI really liked lecture S/I. Physio is a really content heavy class so ofc your professor won't be able to go over all the content in detail. S/I is where I learned these concepts in more detail. Class was mainly drawing/writing on whiteboards as a group and dissecting important concepts. The leaders are also super nice/approachable (they're also students) and provide a lot of insight on the exams and what type of questions will show up\n\nAs for lab S/I, it's nice but wasn't as helpful for me personally. This is mainly because lab is easier to self study for since you don't need as deep of an understanding to get good grades on your quizzes. One thing I didn't really like about lab S/I was that midterm/final reviews were not held during class, but outside of class hours, and those make up a significant chunk of your grade. However, if you're struggling to grasp lab concepts or just want the review it's a good resource\n\nTLDR lecture SI recommended, lab SI only recommended if you need the extra help",

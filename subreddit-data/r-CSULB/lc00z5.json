I think he gave me the benefit of the doubt and also that I wasn\u2019t the only one in that situation at the time.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bank on that same situation working for you though. I believe we were heavily impacted at the time (although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still like that).\n\nSometimes you can skirt around the rules based on a specific situation. It never hurts to ask and talk to your advisor if you are struggling. I was ready to retake the class my last semester, but I was extremely relieved when he let it slide. It worked out since I had gotten laid off from my internship at a company I was preparing to work full time after graduation. So the extra time was spent looking for a job.\n\nAll things worked out. Now been at Boeing for 5 1/2 years so things are good! \n\nAlways remember the long game and one day these struggles in the classroom will be distant memories and you\u2019ll be laughing the day you get 300 reply all emails through your company with everyone screaming \u201cTAKE ME OFF THIS EMAIL\u201d as you are really thankful to be reading that and not studying for a MAE 476 test lol.",

That being said, I really enjoyed my college experience and have really great memories and experiences from my time at CSULB.\n\nAs for timing with employers: depends on the company. Smaller companies will get back to you quicker, larger companies will take a while. My timeline:\n\nLaid off internship February \nStarted applying for jobs last semester\nHad a few interviews with decent success. (A couple offers here and there but I turned a couple down).\n\nApplied to Boing at graduation in May. Heard nothing back. Then another company that originally didn\u2019t hire me, came back since they needed another head. Worked there from Early July to late August. However, Boeing called me back for an interview my first week there at that company. From call back to offer at Boeing was about 6 weeks and on week 7 at the other job I put in my two weeks notice and left to go work for Boeing and started early September.\n\nWaiting is excruciating, but patience is definitely key. As you\u2019re searching, it\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ll never find a job, but once everything clicks, the cogs keep turning and things will work out. Keep at it and stay persistent.\n\nAs for technical interviews: a couple asked a few technical questions like a gas company near the port. I also had a solid works test at a company which did framing for displays. But most of the interviews just wanted to know my experience and how I would handle situations. Boeing has zero technical questions. Everything was based on the STAR format and a panel of interviewers score you. \n\nWhat would you do in situation A?\nHow would you handle this?\nDescribe a time you encountered a difficult technical problem you had little experience with? What was the result? How did you get there?\n\nHope that helps! I really enjoy helping out other engineers finishing out school and how to enter the work force. Feel free to PM me anytime with questions. Mentoring saved me early in my career and I enjoy paying things forward.",

            "comment": "First of all, congrats. Especially on getting cum laude!\n\nSo, the '19 grads were the first to receive the diploma in this style. Before then, the diplomas looked like [this](https://i2.wp.com/glenn.zucman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/transcripts1.jpg?resize=727%2C562). Granted that was a while ago, but they still looked like that for the 2018 grads and before. So, I was pretty disappointed when I got it because, after 11 years of battling all kinds of mental health issues and just flat out being a slacker in between, I finally pulled through and graduated only to be given this cheap paper that easily warps, with the most basic font that sits pretty small overall in the dimensions of the diploma. I found out that the university, as opposed to making the diplomas themselves, now have a third party company that prints them out. That wouldn't have been a problem for me if the university cared enough to at least stick with the same \"old english\" font design, but to also have cheaper paper used? I found that to be kind of ridiculous. I guess they just hired this company and didn't do much (if anything) to lead the design of the diplomas. As for the company now in charge, THE DESIGN IS ALREADY THERE FOR YOU TO FOLLOW. It's classy, it's epic, it's triumphant! I don't know what on Earth made them think \"Hey let's just drop that and use the first font we see on our program...oh look it's Arial. hmmm something is missing....oh I know, let's spice it up with some tiny cursive!  Less is more nowadays right? yayyy easy money...\" Anyway, I  SINCERELY apologize for my rant and I hope I didn't rain on your parade :(. I guess seeing that the university printed out diplomas like this again opened up that wound, lol. I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same way. I know it can just be a piece of paper to some, but it means a shit ton to me. I swear to God, I will not accept a diploma looking like this when I get my masters. Hopefully the university doesn't get too comfortable with this. Regardless, fucking CONGRATS!!",

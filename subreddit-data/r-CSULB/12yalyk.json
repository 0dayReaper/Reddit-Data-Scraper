    "postText": " Hi I committed to CSULB for deaf studies hoping to pursue sign language interpreting but after learning more about the SLP program at CSULB, I realized that's something I see myself doing in the future. I still plan on minoring in ASL at CSULB, but how hard is it to change majors because I saw that we have to keep above a 3.5 gpa for the major requirements.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I'm an SLP major and as a freshman, I was also worried about the GPA requirement since it's the highest of any major. However, it's certainly doable if you work hard in all of your classes prior to declaring. And in the event that your GPA is slightly below 3.5, the department *may* be willing to accommodate you (don't quote me, that's the answer I got from a professor ages ago). If you change majors, I think you'll be assigned pre-major status until you complete the lower-division SLP classes, reach 60 units, and maintain at least a 3.5 GPA. If you have any other questions about the program, feel free to message me!",

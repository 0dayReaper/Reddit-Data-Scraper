I feel like if CSULB informed students the graduation was 2 hours max, less people would have been upset and would have relieved a lot of uncertainty of how it was going to pan out. The experience was nice overall.",

All of the Fine Arts buildings lack air conditioning and ventilation in them; and despite this being an imperative request from SOA, Jane flat out ignored it. What ended up happening sucked even more, because an art professor passed out from heat stroke in her class, ON HER BIRTHDAY, because CSULB was going through LAs worst heatwave season yet.\n\nThey if anything were expected to be the most vocal because this wasn\u2019t the first time they were dealt a bad hand after returning from covid.",

We do have a lot more to be angry about, but I also think that most of the SOA students didn\u2019t have to go into class when that heatwave happened. I did hear they had popsicles to help mitigate the heat, but even I know that\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m hoping the classes graduating after are able to get the president to resign. With enough pressure it\u2019ll happen. It happened at CSULA",

Meaning you have to be in class to be more likely to grow as a student, as well as to pass the class. You seriously think a nursing major or other medical related major would just go online if their labs were too hot to be in? That\u2019d be completely unprofessional and produce medical students with less experience in the field. \n\nArt students have to meet a certain criteria in their portfolio if they want a job, and they can\u2019t do that without their lab spaces to work in.",

Art students typically aren\u2019t wealthy, and most don\u2019t have high powered computers loaded up with $3500 in creative software, and a $2000 drawing tablet waiting for them at home. The school sure as hell didn\u2019t even bother to send them any during the pandemic. You clearly have no idea how much more complex it is to major in art, than it looks on the surface.",

I think I know a thing or two about the program itself seeing as I just graduated from the BFA. Again, your comparison isn\u2019t solid. Nursing students can\u2019t do any of their course work from home but some of not most art students can. I can take photographs from home, I can draw from home, I can make some sculptural pieces from home, I can even do simple wood working projects from home with hand tools.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone !! I got accepted into both CSULB and CSULA for Fall of 2023 and I'm very excited! However I have many questions about admission, especially for CSULB as it is my first choice.\n\nI have provisional admission to both colleges. From what I've learned, it means they're essentially waiting to see my final transcript. I graduated in 2021 with a GPA of 3.29. Do I accepted admission and then send in my transcript again? Or do I send them my transcript first before accepting admission? Can I accept provisional admission into 2 different colleges or is this my final choice in either or? And can CSULB take my admission offer away after I've paid the nonrefundable $150 fee if they do not think my 2021 grades/GPA are sufficient?\n\nI am very nervous about doing anything as this is the first time I've done this and all my friends that I've asked don't have an answer. I'm hoping someone on here may be able to help and ease my fears :,). I really wanna go to CSULB for a Creative Writing major, but I am terrified they can take my admission away.",

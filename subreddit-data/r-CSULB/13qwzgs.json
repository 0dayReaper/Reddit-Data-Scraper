    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI graduated from a CA CC with an AST in Business Admin a little over a year ago. I am interested  in applying to CSULB for the Spring of 2024 and would like to major in Film and Electronic Arts. \n\nI have taken all courses that will satisfy the CSU GE Breadth but have not taken lower division major preparation courses for FEA, which according to the website are FEA 205, 206, 207, 208, and 299. \n\nAm I still able to apply as a transfer for Spring 2024? Or do I have to apply as a first year?",

And they never changed it back. \n\nBut recently the school president has been making excuses saying how they dont have the infrastructure to call names because there is too many students and not enough resources on campus. Despite the fact that before 2020 they made do just fine. And every other CSU has been doing traditional ceremonies. \n\nPresident Connely also said in an interview that she attends every ceremony. And for everyone to walk there would be so many ceremonies that it would be \"exhausting to attend them all\"",

This being on the news is not going to do anything. Before this we were already on a bunch of big new channels, and guess what that did, NOTHING. Our petition that had almost 20k signatures did not do anything either. The main way to cause change and scare Jane is through having a HUGE protest. I am sure I sound like a dick but I am just super frustrated at the students in this school. None of yall actually wanted to make change and it was really sad.",

It isn't being condescending or \"verbally punishing\". Simply just stating the truth because I want there to actually be change. The \"Let 2023 Walk\" Campaign did their job. We informed all the students in the school about what was going on, and it was their job to show they cared. And unfortunately, we were greatly let down. 40 people said on a poll that they were going to show up to the last protest and not even half of that ended up actually being there. If people want change to happen, they have to do more than just signing an online petition that takes a few seconds of their time. This is the main point I want to make clear. If you guys don't amp things up next year it will be the same.",

A lot of people didn\u2019t even know there was a protest going on. Everyone is well aware of what happened, not everyone is motivated enough or inspired enough to make it to a protest they (A) didn\u2019t know about, (B) didn\u2019t see as worth it because of people assuming they don\u2019t care the way you do, repulsing them from the situation, or (C) were simply unaware. Take into account the factors that go into play other than not caring enough because \u201cy\u2019all need to care more\u201d is more than certainly condescending. You\u2019re right that 5/19k is EXTREMELY low, but that is empirically not enough evidence to make claims that harsh and will only hurt the cause.",

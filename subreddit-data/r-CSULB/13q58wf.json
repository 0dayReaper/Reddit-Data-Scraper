Check your transfer credit summary in myCSULB to see if all of your courses were accepted. Most likely some of your coursework was not accepted, potentially because no course equivalency had been identified for some classes you transferred in. If you had transfer courses form multiple schools that will also be averaged into your Overall GPA. \n\nUpper division BIO courses are definitely difficult so be prepared for that and try to balance with remaining GE courses as much as possible. Are you thinking about grad school? Your Overall and CSULB GPAs are important, but your last 60 attempted units will likely be the most important generally.",

Some of my professors passed me for trying (they noticed when my depression started and knew of my situation) some well obviously I had to retake the class and it was much easier the second try. Take gpa boosting classes but if you\u2019re trying to get a minor be careful with how many you take. I have more advice but this is the main stuff.",

If the student already has 18 units replaced and still has a GPA below 2, then more courses will have a much smaller effect on the GPA. This is because they won't replace, they will be averaged, and a student like this has many more units in their overall GPA that act as mathematical inertia.",

However, if you failed any courses at CSULB then you can retake the course and it'll automatically replace the original failing grade with your new grade that must be a C or above. It will still show on your transcript, but your GPA will reflect your grades as if you never failed the repeated course, resulting in a higher GPA. This is what helped me boost my GPA and helped me graduate. Ensure you pass all your courses this upcoming semester and when choosing which failed course to repeat, pick the one you feel is easiest. For any electives you may need, pick classes that are light work for you. Maybe use ratemyprofessor to filter out difficult professors. Also, take advantage of the student success center.

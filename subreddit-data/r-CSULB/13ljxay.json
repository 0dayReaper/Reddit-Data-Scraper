I\u2019ve never taken a proctored test like this. I downloaded the lockdown browser but where will i find the link to exam? I\u2019m not really sure who or where to ask so i thought i would try here. If anyone\u2019s taken it before online and proctored i would really appreciate hearing how it went and how you were able to log in to take it.",

They did also mention tho that it might be possible that transfer student might not be able to take the online exam due to us not having access to canvas courses. They were not sure at all tho because they said canvas was fairly new (honestly it was really confusing and i wish they had been more clear about this). They said you could email them now (testing@csulb.edu) and either move your test date to in person or till the next available ones in september or you could wait and see if you get the confirmation email and if it appears on canvas if it doesn\u2019t email them with time before the exam(they said with a few days). I\u2019m pretty sure that was all the info about the logistics and as for the exam itself it\u2019s pretty much like the SAT essay super simple and straight forward just seeing how well you can answer the question they ask.",

I\u2019m on the mad dash of adjusting courses from this point foward. It\u2019s now looking better. I\u2019ll graduate on time by the skin on my teeth. \nWish anyone would have mentioned this, GWAR, importance prior to applying. I could have been better prepared. Actually, at least prepared. \nIt\u2019s simple, 3-5 paragraphs, answer the prompts, stay on topic, thesis, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Do the workshop if possible and the practice test to be familiar.",

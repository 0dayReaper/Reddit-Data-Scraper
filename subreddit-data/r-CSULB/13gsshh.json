I\u2019ve heard of students needing to change their majors to avoid a class they weren\u2019t able to pass.\n\nI failed and/or withdrew from Astronomy a couple of times at both community college and CSULB. I eventually let it go, took Geology, and got an A. If it\u2019s a GE class, maybe consider letting it go and choosing another option.\n\nI\u2019d talk to your advisor ASAP as well. Your GPA and financial aid could take a hit, and you want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a good decision.",

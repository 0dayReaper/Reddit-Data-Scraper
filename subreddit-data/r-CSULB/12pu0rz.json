            "comment": "It really depends on how comfortable you are with the material covered so far. CECS 229 (Discrete Math 2)  is just an extension of CECS228, so if you did well in 228, you can probably cruise through 229 with minimal effort. \n\nCECS 343 and 323 have some overlap, you go over UML design in both classes (at least I did when I took these classes), but depending on your professor, the workload for databases might be a bit strenuous. I was lucky enough to get Neal Terrell as my professor for 323, he is a fantastic teacher but assigns projects that are a bit complex in nature for those who are just learning the material, and his tests are quite comprehensive so studying for exams also takes a bit of effort. \n\nThe same thing can kinda be said for CECS 225, its a decently complex course with very in depth projects: for perspective, my class ended with a final project of programming an 8 bit CPU in VerilogHDL in groups of 2. (I had Dr. Sayadi, whom I would recommend as he is also a fantastic teacher) . If you have experience in Assembly or VerilogHDL already, it should be an alright course. \n\nI would say overall your schedule looks a bit more intensive than I would recommend scheduling it for, but if you think you are able to handle it then theres nothing inherently wrong with it. Again, this all depends on your previous experiences with some of the material taught in these classes.\n\nAlso don't forget to try and take ENGR-350 early: it is required if you want to sign up for CECS491A, which in turn is a prerequisite for the final capstone project CECS-491B, which you need in order to graduate. This means you should take ENGR-350 **AT LATEST** 3 semesters before you plan to graduate. It is only taught by one professor (Dave Winters) so keep that in mind as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nCheers, a 4th year compsci major at csulb",

So you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time learning to code, and learning all the data structures and some algorithms. \n\n229 - it\u2019s math. So if you\u2019re good at math, then easy, if not, can be tricky. \n\n323 - Will take up a lot of your time and can be pretty tough. \n\n343 - Easy. \n\nSo. Good schedule. I\u2019d take 323 here instead of your later schedule because it only gets more challenging from here.",

            "comment": "I would say some of these classes depend on the professor. 225 was moderate for me, but I got an A in the class. This was mostly due to unfamiliar concepts. 274 was the same for me, but I have heard a lot of students say it was difficult for them. 229 was super easy for me because my best programming skills related to that class. Most people found the class moderate. 323 is one of the most difficult classes for undergraduate computer science. Everybody finds it difficult and if you get Brown as your professor, you will be assigned a metric shit ton of work. 343 was super easy for me and most of the students found it easy too.   \n\nFor future reference, you should try to split 323, 326, 328, and 329 into separate semesters. They are the hardest upper division classes in my opinion.",

I would push it back and do something else\n\ncecs 343 should be easy\n\nI don't know what prior experience you've had because that will make all the difference. If you don't have much programming knowledge than this is def going to be a lot of work. Even if you do you still are going to have some good time management skills.",

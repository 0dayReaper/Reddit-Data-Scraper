I\u2019m very worried about housing as my only other option is to commute 2 hours to school every day :(\n\nAnyone get in with a higher number as a freshman? Should I just give up or should I wait? Also how long would it take until I know if I got a spot or not?",

Which I believe to be so unfair I even emailed them asking why and they said because the application was distance based rather than first come first serve but I live in a toxic household the whole point of me choosing to dorm is so I could better my situation. What am I supposed to do?!",

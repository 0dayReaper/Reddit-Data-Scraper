I personally don\u2019t think it matters because it is not a slur in any shape or form. It\u2019s much different than the n word even if it has the same meaning as a greeting for a friend. I don\u2019t think anyone should care If you say \u201cWhat\u2019s up foo?\u201d to a friend it\u2019s not a big deal.. as it can even be confused with \u201cfool\u201d. But again these are only my thoughts and I don\u2019t even use this word at all. It\u2019s a culture thing for Hispanic groups.",

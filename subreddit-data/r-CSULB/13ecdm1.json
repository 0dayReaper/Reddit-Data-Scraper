    "postText": "Hi.  My daughter will be an incoming freshman this fall in the liberal studies - education department at CSULB.  She will be seeking her MSCP via the ITEP path.  We\u2019d like to send her with a laptop as a HS graduation present (coming up).\n\nCan anyone in the education program comment on whether a Mac or PC is the most appropriate?  Don\u2019t know if there is any specific software that is used in the school of education that would make a PC the wiser choice?\n\nAppreciate the insight!  Thank you!\n\nEDIT:  Thank you everyone for your guidance.  Sounds like a mixed bag, but my key takeaways were that (1) there is no PC specific software used in the CSULB school of education (all web based - ie: Canvas, Office 365, Google Docs), (2) either is OK and it is really a matter of preference around the OS and the standard pluses and minuses around Mac/PC.  I think someone said below \u201cdon\u2019t overthink it, ask her, and either tool will work\u201d.  I\u2019ll follow that advice.  Thanks Again!",

Personally I perfer PC since their software works with more programs. However if your daughter has an iPhone a Mac is not a bad option since transferring files from her phone to computer and vice versa would be easier. Also this depends on your budget. I'm a liberal studies major going down the pathway of itep udcp.",

Plus, since Chromebooks are Google products, it\u2019s harder to use and download Microsoft Office. You have to download different apps, and accessing documents from OneDrive is harder.",

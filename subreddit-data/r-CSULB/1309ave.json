    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m planning on taking graduation photos on campus next week and just want to make sure we\u2019re allowed to do so at the garden? the website states no tripods/professional equipment, but a nikon camera should be ok right? \n\nalso, when i made a reservation online i used my campus login, and it said it was good for up to six people. if the person i\u2019m bringing to take pictures isn\u2019t a student/garden member, will they be turned away? or have to pay to enter? \n\nany help is appreciated, in all my years here i\u2019ve only been to it once for a class so am not too sure how it works. thank u!!!",

Please dont be that person that ignores the \u2018no photos\u2019 signs and thinks that the rules dont apply to them.\n\nJust schedule a permit when you make your reservation and do it then, very easy to do with a little bit of planning.\n\nThe gardens are very small but busy at certain times, I know they receive a lot of field trip visits from surrounding high schools and community colleges too. There is a specific reason it says no photos without permit. So lets not disrespect the gardens like that because you think your photo session might be different. Just get the permit.",

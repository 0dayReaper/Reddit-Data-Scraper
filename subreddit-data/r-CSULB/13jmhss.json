    "postText": "Ik the semester is over but quick question, the professor had me retype a book report although the original assignment said I got to choose which book I wanted to report on. So although we read a book in the class I chose a book from the list I had read before, did the report and submitted it but was told I had to redo it and would get no credit. Due to the nature of this I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize my grade so I retyped it but fear that it is not as good as my first one that I won\u2019t get any credit for. Is there a way to issue a grade appeal also considering this professor hasn\u2019t given an overall grade all semester and just barely graded my first assignment when I asked him about it? I\u2019ve tried finding others to speak to but it\u2019s like a rabbit hole of bad information",

            "comment": "All grade appeals begin with a meeting with the professor to discuss the final grade and assessments on assignments throughout the semester.\n\nI would let final grades shake out this week. Consider the final grade received and what grade you feel you earned. Then review all of your major assignments to see if they were assessed fairly. Once you\u2019ve figured out if the grades are fair, then go meet with the professor.\n\nIf you feel like the book report is not your best work, you can also talk to your prof about it and ask for an incomplete grade to revise the essay. I mean you didn\u2019t have much time to write it, so an incomplete to revise and do a better job is fair.\n\nGoogle \u201cincomplete grade CSULB.\u201d See if it applies to your situation. It doesn\u2019t hurt ask.",

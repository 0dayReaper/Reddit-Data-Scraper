Since I don\u2019t have a mic, I got this weird buzzing sound for the first 10 minutes of the 2 hour lecture (muted the mic on OBS after minute 10 and the buzzing stopped)",

Not really conducive to my learning style. Don't get me wrong, they're a great professor in person. I just think they aren't really prepped or experienced with teaching online. Without the personal touch and relational explanations of the material, a lot of connections are missed. Man, I can't wait until Fall so we can get back in the normal groove of things.",

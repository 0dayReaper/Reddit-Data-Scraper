    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I just got confirmed for housing yesterday. But I\u2019m a little confused on how it works with the roommate selection and than room selection. \n\nI read other peoples post on how the roommate selection is basically tinder but for dorm rooms and that getting your dorm room is basically random time slot to choose your room.\n\nBut what I don\u2019t get is how you choose your roommate and than choose a room. Do you both have to talk and agree to a room before your times slot and both choose that room? Or does only one of you get the timeslot to choose a room?",

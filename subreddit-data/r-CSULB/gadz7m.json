    "postText": "It has become apparent over the last 2-3 weeks that this subreddit is becoming increasingly toxic; or rather, certain individuals are making it that way. I'd like to address a few things.\n\nr/CSULB Reddiquette\n\n1. Please keep sub content related to CSULB  (memes, news, questions, etc.) and SFW (safe for work, nothing inappropriate).\n2. Think before you type. Make sure that what you are writing contributes to productive conversation on this subreddit.\n3. Name-calling/trash-talking are examples of childish behavior. Given that we are college students and adults, I hope you do not exhibit this behavior towards your peers.\n4. Remember the goal of this sub is to be a helpful forum for students, faculty, and alumni to ask/answer questions and support one another.\n\nOther Notes:\n\n* Dispelling the rumor mill- This sub is student-owned, student-run. That's it.\n* For students who are considering attending CSULB, please stop spamming the subreddit with \"CONVINCE ME TO GO TO CSULB\" and \"HELP ME CHOOSE BETWEEN CSULB AND ANOTHER COLLEGE\". No one on this subreddit can make that decision for you. Given that these are repeated questions, I encourage you to use the subreddit search function or ask the r/CSULB subreddit chat or r/CSULB discord server. Depending on how specific your question is, you may need to contact the admissions office, financial aid office, or a department on campus.\n\nA Final Note:\n\nKnow that the mod team is paying close attention to those who are creating toxic posts /comments that are not only unhelpful, but do not contribute to productive discourse. These individuals are generally repeat offenders and not one-time commenters. Bans will be issued as necessary.",

Or will you leave it up but suggest them to just view the other posts?

There\u2019s a strong alumni organization and anecdotally I\u2019ve met hundreds of students, staff, faculty, and alums who have had a great experience at CSULB. Not every department is great, and I know from my experience working with the faculty that COE could definitely use some work, but please don\u2019t contribute to the negativity that this post is literally advising people about by making generalized statements.",

I'm\u00a0 very passionate about pursuing CS and very keen to study in CSULB. 1) Will I\u00a0 be able to apply in CSULB for CS? 2) If no then what are the alternatives for the same? 3) Is it possible if university add math in my curriculum if its necessary to get admit?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(Note:- I had not taken mathematics as a subject in 11th and 12th, however I got 82 % in mathematics in grade 10th. Moreover, I'm fundamentally strong in discrete mathematics and very much familiar with some of basic programming language and also, I had pursued course and have certificates for the same from online training platforms.)\n\n\n\n\nCan u give me some suggestions or kind of guidance for the same",

Not sure though.\n\n 2. Who decides when why and how bans are issued?\n\nThe mods do.\n\n 3. What are Reddit CSULB checks and balances for moderators? Who or what (as in a charter/rules) keeps you in balance from biases or perceived biases for the better of the community? \n\nPretty sure we don't have an official sub charter and I don't think we need one. The general guidelines have been stickied, so if they don't follow them then I guess their fellow mods would hopefully give them shit. Otherwise, I guess we regular people could. I think that's enough.\n\n 4. Is being a CSULB moderator a Resume builder? Would you include this on your resume as experience for a job or scholarship?\n\nYou can put anything on a resume if you want to, but that doesn't mean you should. Personally, I wouldn't lol\n\n5.) The strength of our democracy rests on checks and balances and in the diversity of our voices. Will you open opportunities to the CSULB Family by announcing new moderator positions to the ENTIRE student campus? \n\nThis is Reddit, it doesn't necessarily have to be a democracy and I'm not sure that's a bad thing. A lot of people on the internet are fucking assholes lol\n\nWe are all free to message them to tell them we're interested in becoming a mod anyway. That's good enough.",

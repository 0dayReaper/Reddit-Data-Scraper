    "postText": "I am supposed to transfer to CSULB in the fall from CC. I got conditional acceptance based on graduating from CC. Last week one of my professors from a class I need to graduate dropped me with no explanation. I've been trying to convince her to let me rejoin the class but she's telling me I have to wait to take it again next semester. This course isn't a CSULB requirement, but it is a CC graduation requirement. Because of this I probably won't graduate this semester. Is there a chance Long Beach will rescind my admissions offer because of this? And when is the latest point they can revoke it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: my professor emailed me back saying I was dropped due to \"minimal participation.\" I missed a couple of assignments last week (which I had emailed her about before I got dropped but got no reply) but even with that, I was in good academic standing. Aside from those few assignments I had turned in all the required coursework on time, and was maintaining a solid B in the class. I was hardly lacking participation, as the course averaged 10 assignments a week and up until last week I had missed all but one assignment. I reached out to the department head and am waiting on a reply from him.",

Let them know that you need the class to graduate and you already have an offer to CSULB that will be revoke if you can not get back into the class. Don't stop pushing until you are back in the class. Don't let them tell you NO!",

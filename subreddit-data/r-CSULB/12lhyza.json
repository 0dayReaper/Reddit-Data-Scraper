Super easy, took me maybe 45 mins with a 5 paragraph essay format (intro, 2 body paragraphs, counterclaim, conclusion). You get one little blurb of information, a graph of some sort, and a picture or something. The prompt is something you take a stance on, mine was vaccinations in public schools. Good luck, you got this!",

The prompts ( at least the one I got ) was kinda strange and at the time it felt a bit tricky to write about and I had written four paragraphs in 30ish minutes but ended up with a 14. I am engineering major so i haven\u2019t touched a English class in a WHILE but I still did pretty good. IMO the closest thing to it is kinda like taking an online AP English test except much easier. Good luck and don\u2019t stress it, you\u2019ll be fine!",

Someone mentioned it seems to always be some form of opinion essay so don\u2019t stress and just write from the heart :). But don\u2019t even get me started on how shitty my sentences were LMAO hopefully your syntax is better than mine \ud83d\ude2d",

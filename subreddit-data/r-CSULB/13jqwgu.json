    "postText": "Todays ceremony was absolutely terrible. We stood/sat in 80+ degree sun for what felt like longer than the actual ceremony. Admin showed up, talked for 30 min and then left.  The mini stages were disappointingly small and the whole experience felt very underwhelming. I can\u2019t believe how terrible a job a school like CSULB did w/ this. \n\nI felt ashamed to invite my family and kept having to answer the question \u201cis that it? How come your name didn\u2019t get called?\u201d. \n\nI wish we each got 500 dollars not to attend or I wish wack president Colon would\u2019ve hired a younger eager spokes person to announce names.",

I believe online registrations have now closed, since most celebrations have already taken place. Here's the link used to access info on the cultural celebrations: [https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/cultural-graduation-celebrations](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/cultural-graduation-celebrations)\n\nI had initially received an email during the last few weeks of this semester promoting the cultural celebrations. Each celebration opens registrations and closes once capacity has been met. Unfortunately, since both sessions of the Chicano/Latino celebration have already taken place on May 14, you would have to wait until next Spring to participate in the Chicano cultural celebration. For more information, you can visit [https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/cultural-graduation-celebrations/chicanolatino-graduation-celebration](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/cultural-graduation-celebrations/chicanolatino-graduation-celebration) or email  latinxgrad@csulb.edu",

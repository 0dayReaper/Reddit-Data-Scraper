I know a bunch of exist like for the city of Long Beach, Torrance, the County of Los Angeles, etc. I have seen some positions online work under senator Bradford, but it was really looking towards an opening in local politics in Long Beach. Anyone have any advice as to where to look? Thanks for any help.",

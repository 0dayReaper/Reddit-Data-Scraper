    "postText": "hi, i recently got provisional admission to csulb as a first year out of high school. right now, i am taking honors physics, and i am struggling a lot with this class. the class is NOT a required class, as i already finished my science credits- i just decided to try out physics. i was wondering, if i were to not receive a C or higher in this class by the time senior year ends, would my admission be rescinded? to my knowledge, the official admission requirements just require a 2.5 GPA or above and a C or higher in all required courses, so i\u2019m not sure how this would affect my admission decision. thank you!",

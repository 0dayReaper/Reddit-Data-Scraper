Which programs are you interested in? You are on the right track by joining a research lab. As for doing more, it just depends on what your goals are. If you want to go to grad school, talk to your professor about publishing a paper or speaking at a conference. \n\nCurrently, I\u2019m a research assistant and working part-time as an Administrative Assistant. Previously, I worked as a Behavior Technician for an ABA company. However, it was the research experience that helped me get into grad school.",

In regards to research, so want to research socioeconomics, mental health, and familial dynamics in marginalized groups! \n\nI am currently in the process of getting a paper reviewed for publishing as a co-author!",

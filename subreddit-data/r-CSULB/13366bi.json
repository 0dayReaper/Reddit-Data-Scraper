    "postText": "Hello. I am a Business Administration major, and the two schools I am deciding between are CSULB and UCR. \n\nWhen bringing up school choices, I see people like to place quite some focus on location or the \"college experience\".... While it makes more sense to me not to forget why many of us are in school in the first place. Our future. \n\nSo I ask this: Is the UC system really more prestigious to employers than the CSU system? Because it likely makes more sense for me to go to Long Beach, but one of the reason UCR is a possibility is because of the name the UC system carries, even if UCR isnt one of the top UCs. \n\n\nPros of me going to Long Beach: \n\n- cheaper\n- closer \n\nPros of me going to UCR\n\n- UC title\n- Dorming instead of commuting\n\n\nFeel free to share your experiences if you think it will contribute in any way. Thank you!",

In such a case even UCR would be viewed negatively, only UCB and UCLA from the UC system would help you out. The good news is that for pretty much every other entry level situations the school you went to doesn\u2019t matter at all, what matters are your GPA, internships, letters of recommendation and technical skills ( I can\u2019t stress how important learning Excel functions and VBA is). At the end of the day your personal achievements matter way more than which college you went to.",

Talk to your career services center too.

UCLA if your a great athlete trying to pursue a professional career, but fall back on a Business degree.\n\n2. UC Berkeley if your trying to gain prestige and make solid connections with a career in Engineering.\n\nThese are names with specific programs that are nationally recognized as being \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f.\n\nBeyond VERY SPECIFIC scenarios like this. An employer couldn\u2019t give a flying fuck if you went to UCR or CSULB. What they will care about is your INTERNSHIPS! Intern, intern, intern\u2026. You\u2019ll pass all your peers I promise you in job prospects and starting salary who went to more \u201cprestigious, but not really cause that\u2019s a load of shit\u201d if you intern at a level that puts you in the top 10%.\n\nPSA: Only places your going to get blanket prestige is at a school like Stanford / Harvard / MIT / CalTech. Otherwise your wasting your time and money.",

CSULB was only a 10 min drive from my house and it's way cheaper. I felt this obligation to attend UCLA because of the prestige associated with the school. Everyone I talked to told me to go to UCLA but I never listened to what I wanted. Now I'm stuck at this school that I don't really like. I would say ask yourself this: \"which school will I be most comfortable at?\" and be honest with yourself. At the end of the day prestige will only give you a marginal boost in the job market, if at all. So just go where your gut tells you to go.",

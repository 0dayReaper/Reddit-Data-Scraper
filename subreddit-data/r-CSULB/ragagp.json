IK it is the 5th floor library and people are able to talk and be noisy. However, you don't have to be hollering and laughing like a maniac. Your group was the loudest on the floor. Even people are talking at normal level are not even making as much noise as you. Multiple people came up to your group to ask you to quite down a bit, but they just stared at the person asking or just chose to ignore. Like WTF. chill.",

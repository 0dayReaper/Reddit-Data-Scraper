This is what I did.\n- YOU LEARN MORE FROM MISTAKES THAN FROM SUCCESS .Realize now that your first semester is going to be bad.  Everyone\u2019s first semester was rough because it was a very big transition. Once your first semester is over you need to analyze it and make sure you learn what to do and what not to do\n- MAKE OBJECTIVES and prioritize which need to be done first.  Write done what should be done by the end of the week. i.e homework, study, etc\u2026. Make sure to actually write them down on a piece of paper to have in front of you so that you have to look at it.  I used sticky notes and put them on the corner of my computer\n- PLAN CLASSES WISELY.  The only way to know what schedule suits you best is to go through a full semester and think what suits you.  Some people like no gaps between classes while others like me prefer gaps to study on campus between classes.\n-OFFICE HOURS!!! I can\u2019t stress this enough.  If you are stuck on a question or don\u2019t understand a concept please go to office hours.  Your professor will make sure you understand.  Asking is the only way to learn so ask as much as you want.\n-REWARD YOURSELF.  Once you complete the objectives you set for the week you can treat yourself to something small just to keep you motivated.  You can also reward yourself with something big after working hard on a midterm as well. It can be buying something or just doing your favorite activity or hobby\n- BREATHE.  If it\u2019s going rough for you just take a moment to breathe and realize no matter how bad of a situation you\u2019re in it\u2019s going to be ok because you will figure it out.\n\nAs you can see the tips all involve taking small steps at a time.  This is pretty much all you need.  If you want to ask me any questions go ahead.  Good luck!",

Also avoid the LA times guy(ifykyk) usually by the bookstore. always look for a pdf unless required a program for hw. also don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help and actually let yourself breakdown everyone does it and honestly it\u2019s very relieving. also you might get imposter syndrome which fucking sucks but at the end of the day you earned your spot here and are paying to be here so make the most of it. and if your dorming surround yourself with good people most of the time they will be your dorm family and keep those connection! focusing on school is importan too but don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself it gets extremely hard especially at the end of the semester!! also advice for your first day get there early there will be so much traffic and parking is a bitch during the first 2 weeks of the semester!",

I heard from my neighbors that PDF is usually the way to go to so I owe that to them and you too. Letting myself breakdown is a surprising piece of advise but it\u2019ll probably happen sooner than later tbh.\n\nAlso thanks for the parking advice too that\u2019s actually really helpful thank you",

Your financial aid will generally come around the same time every semester. There\u2019s resources on campus to help you succeed, take advantage of them whenever possible because they\u2019re there to use and paid for with your tuition money. When things get tough, do your absolute best not to shut down. Instead, buckle down and tackle things one and forget about other big assignments you may have. Just be sure to make time for everything.",

I\u2019ve used it before when I failed a class and thought I had to add an extra semester but there\u2019s always a different path you can take. Also make sure you network and get internships! Internships will help you in the long run and if you\u2019re able to get a job offer before your senior year you won\u2019t have to worry about applying to new jobs if you don\u2019t want to. Lastly just have fun and try to go out. Join fun classes. Kin classes are fun and anyone can take them. They have surfing, archery, golf, etc\u2026 it\u2019ll be good for your mental health which is probably the most important thing in college.

I personally plan out my week to make sure everything that I need to do is completed preferably by the weekend, that way I can enjoy the weekend without worrying about any assignments that I may have procrastinated on. This also softens the blow on exams, because it\u2019ll feel like you are simply reviewing everything because you have already been doing the work, as opposed to cramming a lot of new information right before the exam. \nI would also recommend looking into how to study efficiently, as this will save you a lot of time and allow you to retain new information. \nAlso be aware of your mental health, it plays a big role in your ability to do anything. Take care of yourself and remind yourself of the reason why you decided to pursue a higher education in the first place. It won\u2019t be easy, but the end result will be worth it all. \nEnjoy your college years and make the most out of it\u2014join clubs, make friends, and try new things. These are the years you\u2019ll be reminiscing about once this era of your life is over. \nYou got this!",

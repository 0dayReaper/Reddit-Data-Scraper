    "postText": "hi, so i was taking the GWAR and I was trying to take a photo of my ID. and you know how the page will show two screens - one screen showing you while the other screen is showing a picture of ur previous photo?\n\nthe thing is, the right photo came out a bit blurry so i pressed \"Try Again\", so the left screen took a photo of me in that moment and the right photo got replaced by a photo of me looking at my screen (which i didnt mind). so i was preparing my ID card in the left screen to come out more focused, but i think i might've pressed \"Continue\" instead of \"Take Photo\" because it never showed me a photo of my retake. so now i think my ID Confirmation Photo is just me looking at my screen \ud83d\ude2d pls help me, what do i do to confirm the photo was taken? i dont wanna take the GWAR placement test again \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d",

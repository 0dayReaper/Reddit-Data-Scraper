    "postText": "Deadline for committing approaches..! I am a transfer student looking for any advice/thoughts/suggestions on Santa Cruz's Art major program versus the Arts programs at Long Beach. If I went to LB, I would try to get into the 3D Media program for either Wood or Metals and Jewelry. A bit concerned about the broadness of UCSC's arts and worried I would feel directionless.\n\n I'm originally from the bay so curious about how the area of LB feels (I can't make a visit bc I'm out of the country), but LA area seems dope and I like the sun lol. Anyways any thoughts are welcome on social life/housing/nightlife/school culture or anything else. \n\nThank u in advance :\\^)",

I don\u2019t know much about Santa Cruz though, hope it helps sorry I can\u2019t give a more useful perspective.",

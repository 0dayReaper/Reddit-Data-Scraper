I have visited both campus and liked both of them but I'm more interested about the actual MSW program. Can anyone share their experience at CSULB/CSUF as an MSW student or share thoughts about CSUF/CSULB?",

Im in my second year and based on what I have learned, I believe it is a great program and would be a valuable opportunity for anyone interested in pursuing a career in social work.",

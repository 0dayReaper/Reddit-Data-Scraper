I\u2019m going to move in to my apartment beginning July, but idk if I\u2019ll be able to use anything on campus since I\u2019m not registered for summer and won\u2019t register for my classes until I talk to my advisor mid July.",

According the the website, you wouldn't be able to get a membership.\n\nhttps://www.asirecreation.org/membership\n\n\"Any students not enrolled in summer courses, but were an enrolled student in the previous spring semester are eligible to purchase a summer membership at the prorated rate of $94 (first day of summer session through the last day of summer session). \"",

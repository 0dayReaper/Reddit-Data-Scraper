Here\u2019s my \u201cguide to Long Beach\u2019s coast\u201d from West to East:\n\n-Queen Mary and Spruce Goose across the river from Downtown\n\n-Downtown Long Beach w/: the Pike shopping mall, aquarium, lots of bars and restaurants, and some boating activities\n\n-Retro Row, 4th St.: Hipster district, thrift shops, roller skate shop, record stores, expensive coffee, good bars and restaurants\n\n-Junipero Park: honestly there\u2019s something going on pretty much every day. Yoga in the park, great overview of the water, plenty of room to picnic, outdoor calisthenics equipment\n\n-Belmont Shore, 2nd St.: probably the predominant place to \u201cgo out\u201d and hit the bars and restaurants and not a bad place to do it\n\n-2nd and PCH: every mall place you can think of plus a farmers market\n\n-Seal Beach: more laid back, some cute restaurants and shops, and where to go if you want to play in the waves (there are no waves in LB harbor)\n\nThose are kind of my closest accessible to CSULB activities, I\u2019m sure I missed parts of it and people have what they like and don\u2019t. I loved off of cherry so I love my central LB, but there\u2019s something for everyone in Long Beach. I didn\u2019t mention the old school bars on Anaheim like Joe Jost\u2019s or the gay bars down Broadway because I kept it to the all-ages establishments.",

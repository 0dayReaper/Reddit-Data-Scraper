And even then they don't even enter our room. Just made sure no one was inside. \n\nI think it should be fine since they really aren't strict. I had a large rice cooker, george foreman grill, and a water kettle. It should be fine as long as you aren't burning anything creating a lot of smoke. The only time the alarm was triggered was when someone burned something in a toaster oven they brought haha.",

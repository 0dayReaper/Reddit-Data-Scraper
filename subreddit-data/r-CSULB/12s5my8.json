    "postText": "Hi guys. So recently I have applied for a master program at CSULB and I received an email that said the department generally review the application after the deadline and make decisions 4 to 6 weeks after. However, my friend that applied to the same program already got accepted and never receive the email. The only difference is he summited the application about a month before me. Is the content in the email that I received is true or more of a courtesy email?",

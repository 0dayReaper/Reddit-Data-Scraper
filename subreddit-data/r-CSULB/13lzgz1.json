I don't know where this B is coming from since throughout the semester the prof never graded anything or inputted grades on beachboard. I feel like she may have just decided our grades based on what she thinks of us or something random like that... my essays were actually good but she did not seem to like me. What should I do? Is it worth emailing her about it or should I just take the L.\n\nI mean this is only a GE class but it frustrates me that my prof was like this.",

I will do that. Also on BB there was no grade in the \"grades\" section, only on the dropbox there was feedback on one essay and she wrote \"A\" in the comments. So no official grade there... Would screenshotting the dropbox section suffice?",

Since I turned in all of my work, I really thought I earned an A in the course. Would you be able to give me a grade breakdown, please?\" Be respectful, and try not to be blame-y, but state your case.   \n\n\nStill, since they didn't keep the grades current through the semester, and still haven't updated the gradesheet, even if they justify the B grade, you should still have grounds to appeal. Again, might be a lot of footwork, but seems like things are in your favor.",

I'll definitely try a grade appeal. Is there a deadline for professors to change grades? I will wait a few days to see if she inputs the grades on BB. Right now, I have no grade on BB for this class at all, as she only put the grade for one of my essays in the feedback portion of the dropbox.",

The majority of faculty are not paid during the summer and are not expected to work then, so they might not respond until the Fall semester begins.  Should you get no response, wait until the semester begins and contact them again.  Should that fail, you contact the department chair asking them to intervene.",

A professor I had would take 2 months to grade papers and somehow expected our work to improve without giving us feedback/a grade before the next one was due. As to what others are saying, for someone that wants to go to graduate school or further their education after their undergrad degree in general, a B can really hurt their GPA. I could not afford to get anything less than a 4.0 this semester to have a chance of getting into a certain graduate program. Don\u2019t just let it go.",

Many instructors don\u2019t, especially in Liberal Arts. Check out 5.3 here: https://www.csulb.edu/academic-senate/policy-final-course-grades-grading-procedures-and-final-assessments.\n\nAt this point, we don\u2019t know if nothing has been graded. We just know that nothing is in BB for whatever reason.\n\nListen to @digitalosiris\u2019s advice. Check out the prof\u2019s grading policy in the syllabus and meet with them to discuss your individual assignment grades and final grade breakdown.",

I don't know what is generally considered important in choosing a college in United States.\n\nCalifornia State University Long Beach Business\n\nUniversity of Washington Bothell Business\n\nUniversity of Washington Tacoma Business\n\nI am currently attending a community college in Washington state. My major is business. I have already received acceptances from these three universities. I think these things are important when choosing.\n\nWhich colleges are good for getting a job in United States? \n\nWhich universities are likely to enjoy campus life?\n\nWhich one has more friendly people?

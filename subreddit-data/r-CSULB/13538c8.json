    "postText": "I accepted my enrollment for the fall a few days ago and have been researching about the transfer process, things to do before fall, etc. I have like 3 questions that I was wondering one of y\u2019all can help answer or guide me \ud83d\ude2d apologies because I know some answers might be in the CSULB website but just wanna be sure lol\n\n1. I know this year, SOAR and enrolling in classes day may be separate. Would we be informed about signing up for classes in the SOAR orientation along with any other questions we might have? It\u2019s a necessity to attend but should I make an appointment with my major advisor this month?\n\n2. Since housing is so limited and I will surely not get put into any housing for the fall despite signing up, will my tuition change to commuting after they let us know if we got in or not? Would wanna know how much I\u2019d get back to look for off-campus places. I\u2019m considered non traditional (24) so wondering if anybody has groups for ppl like me in search of housing \ud83d\ude2d\n\n3. How easy is signing up for a semester or 6 months abroad? I\u2019d really wanna do this as a Spanish major but would wanna know if it\u2019s a difficult process in terms of availability and cost.\n\nSorry for so many questions but just wanna be as informed as possible! Thank y\u2019all \u2764\ufe0f",

I haven\u2019t done it, but I\u2019m pretty sure you can get financial aid for it, so I would guess it\u2019s not as difficult cost-wise as I would expect. I know there are info sessions and stuff for different programs at some point so if you find specific trips you\u2019d be interested in, that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.",

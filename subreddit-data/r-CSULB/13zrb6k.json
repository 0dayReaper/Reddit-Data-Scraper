    "postText": "Does anyone know exactly how the beach bucks work? I\u2019m transferring in the falls and had to buy a meal plan because I\u2019m living in the dorms. Do they work at the dining halls? Is the amount of money that you pay for the meal plan loaded on your ID card all at once? The website isn\u2019t very helpful.",

            "comment": "your meal plan and beach bucks arent really related unless youre adding flex dollars (i think thats what theyre called). you should have a specific amount of meals per week depending on what meal plan u chose. I think if you run out of meals and u have flex dollars in your account, you can use that to pay for your meal.",

            "comment": "When you get a meal plan, you have a certain amount of meals you can use throughout the week or semester (depending the plan). It\u2019s not transferable as cash. Your account will just say that you have 10 meals left that week. Beach bucks are a separate form of school currency. They can be used at any school store, shop, restaurant, ect. The meal plan does not come with any. You can choose to add some to your account, but you might as well just pay in cash or debit card at the school stores or restaurants. The only thing you actually need beach bucks for is to print at the bookstore and computer lab (but there are machines inside to load a few dollars on)",

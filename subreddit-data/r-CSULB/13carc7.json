    "postText": "hi all, \n\ni was notified today that i was accepted into housing and that roommate selection would start may 22nd but i figured it didnt hurt if i started looking before :) im a junior polsci major (she/her) transferring in and i enjoy waking up around 10am and going to sleep around 11pm. i prefer double room, and a generally clean area (basically, we can just pick up after ourselves). i am 420/alc friendly as long as it doesn't get us in trouble and i'm okay with visitors/friends coming over as long as there's notice given in a timely manner. \n\n\nactivities i plan on enjoying outside of our room, include: going to the gym, joining the roller skating club and, attending music concerts etc. i'm very open minded and down to join you for grocery/food runs as well. \n\n\ni am fully vaccinated and i'm cool with having service/emotional support animals in the room as long as they're taken care of, as well. if you would like to reach out, please pm me so we can exchange instagrams :)",

I'm aware this is 2022-2023, but it should be safe. \n\nExample: F_N 20\tNutrition and Life might count in Assist? Check LBCC to CSULB contract on Assist. Check Nutrition dept. Read contract. NUTR 20 Nutrition and Life counts as NUTR 132 at CSULB. Check [CSULB GE category E](https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/ge-approved-courses-category-e-lower-division). NUTR 132 counts. Thus, as long as NUTR 20 transfers as NUTR 132, you're good.",

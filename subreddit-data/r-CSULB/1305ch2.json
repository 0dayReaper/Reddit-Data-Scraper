    "postText": "Hi! So I realized that I've been screwing myself over these past two years by letting FAFSA believe that my parents are helping me pay for college. I've contacted FSA for help on how to change my FAFSA, but I also contacted CSULB's financial aid office and I haven't heard a response from either. \n\nAny chance they'll reply soon?",

Their income will still be considered for EFC calculations, and your EFC is what will determine what you receive from FAFSA.  \n\n\nIf you want a quicker answer from financial aid, you can always call on the phone or try and talk to a FA rep at Brotman Hall.",

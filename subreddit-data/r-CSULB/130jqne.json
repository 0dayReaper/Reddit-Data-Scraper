    "postText": "Hey everyone! My 3 roommates and I are looking for someone to replace me. The apartment is in Anaheim but is 6 miles from the university and if you're taking the bus about 30-60 minutes to get to campus depending on what time you go. You have a bedroom to yourself and a shared restroom with another roommate. Quiet streets usually have quiet neighbors as well, a decent size living room, and a balcony if you ever want some fresh air. Roomates are all chill, kind, 420, and alcohol frienglly. They all usually do their own thing but are open to doing activities. So as long as you're chill and respectful you will definitely fit in! Please shoot me a message if you're interested!",

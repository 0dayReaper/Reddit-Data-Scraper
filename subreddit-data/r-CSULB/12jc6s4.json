    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m a transfer student and so far I\u2019ve gotten into CSUF, CSULB, UCI, and UCR. I\u2019ve been looking through all my options and like all the schools I\u2019ve been accepted into so far, but have my ups and downs for all. My goal is to get a bachelor\u2019s in history and then go to Law School after. I was wondering if CSULB has anything that would help me get into law school after I graduate and if there\u2019s an academic advisor I could talk to to see the options and paths to one day get my JD I would have if I transfer to CSULB. Thanks for any help and advice!",

It\u2019s a 3 part course/workshop, and let me tell you\u2026 I learned a LOT! \n\nBesides that, I believe we have a mock trial club and maybe other law related clubs that I have not been a part of but I would say from my experience (bc I too want to go to law school after graduating next month)\n I\u2019d recommended that law school readiness course 1000%.",

There is no one major that's is necessary for law school; but History, Philosophy, and Political Science are usually the best choices. Definitely take CLA 392. The main other courses are HIST 479, POSC 311 and 312 PHIL 351 and 352, POSC 414, etc. Avoid junk courses like JOUR 430 and BLW220",

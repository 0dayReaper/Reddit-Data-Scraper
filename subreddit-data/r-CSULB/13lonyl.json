    "postText": "Sooo i got a parking citation.. I was there for 10 minutes, couldn\u2019t get the stupid online payment thing to work (meter was out of service) so I went back to move my car and there it is.. a ticket. I know they probably won\u2019t care or believe me so I was just going to pay it. However, on the citation they wrote my license plate number wrong (they switched 2 letters). Any luck I can just not pay it? lol",

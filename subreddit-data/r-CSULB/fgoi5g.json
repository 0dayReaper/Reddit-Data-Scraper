The sick and elderly already have a hard enough time as it is when it comes to their health; however, we can make it easier on them by all working together to stop the spread of covid-19 before it gets worse. \n\nI know that my parents personally want me to continue working and going to school too but the threat of coronavirus is making it harder for me to do so since it poses a serious threat to my (already bad) health. \n\nIf switching to online classes for a while / limiting our activity in the outside world can help stop the spread before it gets too bad, why shouldn\u2019t we do so? Everyone deserves an equal opportunity to have a safe and healthy lifestyle. We need to work together to help those in need, even if it means sacrificing some things in our own life for a hot minute.\n\nWe may be looking at this issue from two different perspectives (healthy vs. chronically ill) but I\u2019m sure we can both agree that we just want the majority of people to return to a healthy and normal life as soon as possible :-)",

There is just evidence to prove that with healthy individuals hand washing, staying at home when your sick, and keeping a healthy immune system should be enough to prevent the spread of infection and not have to close school. But with the fact that many sick people will still come to school (or might not know there are infected as the symptoms can be super mild or nonexistent)and put all of the vulnerable people at risk, I see your point! :)",

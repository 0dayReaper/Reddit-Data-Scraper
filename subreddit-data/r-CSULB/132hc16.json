Next semester is my last and I\u2019m planning to take 3 in person. I haven\u2019t really made any friends or connections since I\u2019m a bit older that the average crowd. I was planning on applying for grad school but I have no academic or professional references so idk if it\u2019s even worth applying. Work wise I\u2019ve been working part time as a caregiver for a family member so I have very limited work experience as well. I genuinely have no idea on what to do after graduation.",

Once you get your bachelor\u2019s, you take the cbest test at a Pearson center and then apply for your sub permit through the CTC (you just send them your documents and pay some money). Then you can apply to school districts or a subbing agency. It\u2019s pretty easy to get subbing jobs right now, subs are in superrrr high demand!",

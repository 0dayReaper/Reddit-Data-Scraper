    "postText": "Hello!  So, my daughter is transferring from Mt Sac but somehow the College Board didn\u2019t send her AP scores.  Yesterday, she received an email stating that her admission was rescinded.  She was unaware that her admission was under review and would\u2019ve gladly fixed any discrepancy.  Now, her scholarship is no longer valid either!  Of course, she\u2019s filed an appeal and sent the scores again, what are her chances of being readmitted?  She is devastated, as we are all.  Is there anything else I can do?  I\u2019ve already emailed the admissions director.  Thank you in advance for any help.",

If you are going in person or via zoom, make sure you have evidence of the AP scores ~ basically login in to your daughter account for AP scores if they ask. Hope it helps! Thank you!",

Especially when something goes wrong. \n\nLearning how to resolve an issue is a very important life skill.  Based on what you said, your daughter is a high achieving AP Student, so really, shes an adult who is capable of figuring this out. \n\nI\u2019d suggest having your daughter take over the process. It\u2019s very important to learn how to resolve these issues on the application, and she will learn how to resolve and manage her AP scores, especially in these challenging situations.",

All you want to do is help!  Oh, and the scholarship is significant, too, which helps me, so I definitely have a vested interest in seeing that get secured, lol!",

I sent it quickly with express mail and they got it in time, but beforehand I saw that it happened to a lot of people the years prior. I\u2019m sure going physically to the campus or falling different departments would help your daughter get her admissions back",

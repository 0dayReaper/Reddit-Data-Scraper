    "postText": "hello! sorry if this is a stupid question. i\u2019m a high school senior, and i just committed to long beach. i applied as a psychology major, but when i was first offered my acceptance back in february, i was offered admission into the \u201cpre-communication studies.\u201d i know communications is part of the liberal arts college, but does that just mean it\u2019s general prerequisite classes i have to take before i can become any other liberal arts college program major? or does it mean they intend for me to continue as a communications major? sorry again if it\u2019s a stupid question, i just wasn\u2019t sure where else to ask. thank you for any help",

            "comment": "Not sure how helpful my answer would be for you. I believe it just means there are a few classes you need to take to fulfill the major declaration.  I think it\u2019s best you reach out to Admission for a clearer answer! \n\nI\u2019m also a transfer student and wanted to change my major to Comm Studies this semester. Talked to a counselor and they said I\u2019m missing a few courses so I\u2019m not accepted in the College of Liberal Arts yet until I have all my prerequisites out of the way. So technically they said I\u2019m a Pre-Comm major right now.",

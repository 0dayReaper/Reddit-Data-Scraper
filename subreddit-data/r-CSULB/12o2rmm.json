I usually just get the soup though cause it\u2019s really hard to fuck up soup and I find that some of their soups are actually pretty good (like the vegetable soup, that must have fucking crack in it) \n\nWith that being said the menu is really wack. They will have the most random shit some days. Donuts, coffee, soda, ice cream and fruit are always guaranteed tho (amongst other things) so I at least know I can go in any day and leave with fruit at least.",

There\u2019s also always a salad bar, fruit, cereal, and waffles available (all of which is decent quality in my opinion)",

They usually only have one vegetarian option per day though unless you get a salad, make yourself a sandwich, get cereal, or make yourself waffles, which really sucks. Im hella picky with fresh vegetables, I\u2019m sus of the sandwiches, the cereals are meh but like I wanna eat something real, and same goes for the waffles. If the one vegetarian option sucks, then you\u2019re fucked. You can always order like a grilled cheese or something, but ugh, wish they just had more vegetarian options. Most of the time the vegetarian options are good, but when they aren\u2019t, you\u2019re shit outta luck\n\n\nEdit: fixed grammar",

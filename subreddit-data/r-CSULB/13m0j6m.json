My first semester was tough due to some circumstances. Will I be put onto academic probation if my overall gpa is higher than a 2.0 but CSULB gpa is slightly below?",

You\u2019ll be put onto academic probation since it\u2019s your CSULB GPA that the school cares more about. As long as you\u2019re able to get your CSU GPA up next semester, you\u2019ll be cleared of the academic warning like I was.",

My only problem now is finding a place to live since my waitlisty number is 613 I prefer it to be a reasonable walking distance from CSULB but I can drive some 10-15 mins or so.  I will like to stay with other students as I am a transfer student and will like to get to know other students.  \n\nlf anyone else on here is in need of off-campus housing AND a roommate.  Or if anyone is looking for a roommate please reach out to me",

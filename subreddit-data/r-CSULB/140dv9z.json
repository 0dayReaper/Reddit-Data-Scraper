Lo and behold, my national guard unit got the word that we were deploying out of the country, so I unfortunately had to get my admission deferred. Well 9 months later and I\u2019m still hanging out here in lovely Kuwait, but I\u2019m only a couple months out from going home, and getting ready to re-apply for the spring 2024 semester. My VA counselor told me to fill out the return from military leave form when I was ready go back to school, but the instructions seemed a little vague. School applications do t start until august so I still have some time, but I didn\u2019t know whether to fill out the form now, or after I applied to the school again, or what. Was wondering if anyone else has been in the same boat as me? Thank you, have a great rest of your Sunday y\u2019all",

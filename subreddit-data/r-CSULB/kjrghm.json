I\u2019m a POSC minor and this was actually the first class I\u2019ve taken toward the minor, so it was nice to see that I can hold my own in a department that is pretty foreign to me (I\u2019m a finance major). I was also fortunate enough to have Dr. Whitehead for this class and he is an excellent instructor!",

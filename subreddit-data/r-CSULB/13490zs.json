With social life, being part of campus orgs or club sports has helped with making friends (it\u2019s even better if the club has their own space/office so you can basically chill/camp there). I\u2019m pretty introverted so it takes a little bit extra effort to go to social events, but I\u2019ve never regretted going to a social event, I regret not going to enough, although you do have to balance how much time you spend socializing and school work.",

I have not had much of a social life in this school mainly due to the commuting. But, its important to note, that how social you are on campus depends on your major and also if you care about getting good grades. For example, I am trying to get the best grades that I can so I have to sacrifice a lot of my free time to study instead of trying to make friends on campus. but if you don't study that much you can definitely make friends.  But it doesn't help that commuting sacrifices even more of my free time, so that on top of all the studying gives me no time. You also have to worry about driving back home and avoiding traffic which is a reason why I don't really hangout with people after class, because I have to worry about hitting traffic on the way back. Also, majority of students are commuters so most of them don't even to try and converse with each other.",

Take the initiative by asking classmates (clubmates, is this a word?) out to a hike or do a study session. I also recommend running for a club officer position if there's one available in a club you'd like to join. The clubs are also rather specific in their naming convention, if none of them apply to you - still go! I go to a board game night hosted by the History Department and I'm a Spanish major. I'm not Brazilian and I attend biweekly meetings hosted by the Brazilian Student Association. Take the initiative.",

If you put yourself out there it\u2019ll be easy to make friends! I have one semester left and will definitely be more open to meeting new people.

We\u2019ve met up during winter break, and so on, so it\u2019s definitely possible, but like someone mentioned, the exposure you get depends on your major but also on your social skills.

Honestly, just approaching someone within one of your classes, making a class discord, and joining clubs are all the way to go. Trust me when I say this, you\u2019re gonna have to take the first step cuz not many people will approach you. Personally, I joined the archery club and everyone there is very approachable, not to mention there\u2019s all kinds of people there.",

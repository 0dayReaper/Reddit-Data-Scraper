Absolutely. \n\nAre you being unreasonable and just as much of a douche for honking so unnecessarily after you made your point that you were butt hurt losing 10sec of your time?

It seemed he gave a simple hand wave at first when he walked by, then you honked after you realized they were switching which caused his reaction. After they\u2019re in the car and leaving the honking was a bit excessive nonetheless, hence the brake checking. And yes brake checking is stupid and a dick move on his part.",

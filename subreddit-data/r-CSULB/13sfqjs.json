    "postText": "My current professor sent a email to a research professor and wanted me to join him to become his assistant during the summer semester. I met the research professor in April, and told me that he was going to have me on board with him during the summer. During the final week of class, my current professor sent a email to him letting him know about the summer research project, I had even sent a email to him as well, but nothing. Summer is coming and I haven\u2019t heard anything back, what should I do? Did I get ghosted?",

    "postText": "So this is what got me messed up.\n\nAfter I did my mandatory freshman advising for my computer science major and when I was able to enroll in my courses, I was put on an enrollment hold even though I fulfilled all the requirements to be able to enroll.\n\nBecause of this, I was unable to enroll into my courses and I had to email my advisor for help.\n\nAfter a few days later, my advisor responded by saying that they were able to lift my hold, indicating that I was not supposed to be put on this hold and that it was their fault on their end.\n\nBecause of this, I am now unable to enroll in the classes that I previously wanted to enroll in because they got filled up after those few days and now I am pissed because this is not even my fault.\n\nSo I\u2019m trying to take MATH 123, PHYS 151, and some CECS courses, and I was told that in order to take my math and physics courses, I have to get in contact with the physics and math department to see if they can have me enroll in a course even though it\u2019s filled.\n\nAre there any tips or suggestions on how I can get this done?\n\nI am so frustrated and lost.\n\nThank you.",

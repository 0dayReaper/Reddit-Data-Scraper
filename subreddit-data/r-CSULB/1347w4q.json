Is there anyway to be able to customize the slide or what happens if I didn\u2019t do it ?\nI\u2019m kinda bummed that with how organized they\u2019ve been with graduation this year. I never received any emails stating when things would open or close. I was told a email would be sent out so I waited. Only found out from the bookstore associate when I mentioned how confused I was on how graduation is this year",

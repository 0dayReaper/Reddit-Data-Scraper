    "postText": "One of my professors never graded anything from the beginning of the semester till now, it is an asynchronous class, and he never responds to emails. We had discussions and quizzes that he never graded, and a month ago he emailed us saying that he will release the grades on the weekend, 1 month goes by...nothing, emailed him about it...nothing. How can we know how are we performing in the class...if we are passing or failing?!?!?!! I know this is not normal but what should we do? \n\nThank you",

Had one class last semester where none of our labs/notes were graded until the end of the semester and we didn\u2019t know our midterm grades until after we took our final. Professors don\u2019t exactly have to give back grades before the end of the semester, they need just to have final grades ready by the end of the semester so it is something they can do and it\u2019s just annoying when it does happen.",

    "postText": "This is to everyone considering attending CSU Long Beach (CSULB) in the Fall. We were so excited when our daughter was accepted last year. She got a dorm room relatively easily, which we were soooo relieved about, because she was NOT ready to live in an apartment. But when we were preparing for her second year, out of the almost 3000 beds available, the university only sets aside 600 beds for returning students. That is all. They filled their quota by 10:01 on sign up day. We are on the wait list, but the wait list for returning students gets filled AFTER the wait list for new students. Now she has to look for an apartment. The cheapest apartment is around 2000 a month. We can\u2019t afford that. Keep in mind, if your child goes here, housing the second year is almost impossible to get. I really wish we had known that when we signed up, we wouldn\u2019t have chosen CSULB. we would have chosen a college that offered dorms for second year students. They do have hotel rooms available they offer the students. But, again, not all of them and they need transportation to school. Be warned. We wish we had been",

Dorming blows anyways, exorbitant parking pass costs, dining hall is pretty subpar, you pay the same amount anyways.\n\nFind friends and rent an apt/house and save money. Do your own laundry, cook your own food, struggle daily so you don't have to struggle anymore. I thought it was normal to move out after your 1st year of dorming though. \n\nWish you guys best of luck whichever way you go, if you guys decide to waitlist, or are able to find housing elsewhere! I trust that you guys will go with the latter, peace of mind and cheaper and much more fun!",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nI dormed my first year and they usually do warn you that second year+ students don't usually get housing accomodations. I was also unaware of how to find housing my second year but here's my advice: \n\nIn terms of apartments, renting a single apartment for your daughter is SUPER expensive. I would recommend looking for a group of friends who would be willingly to split the costs and live with her in an aparment or home. If this isn't the case, I would recommend your daughter joins the CSULB Roomate Finder page on Facebook to look for an apartment with other groups. There are multiple listings and many people find housing this way. It is honestly way cheaper than the dorms if you get a single room (approx $800-$1,000) and share a bathroom with some other people, or if you get lucky you might get your own bathroom for a decent price. Just make sure you're not paying too much for an apartment room. A single room with shared bath should range from ($800-900) and with a private bathroom maybe ($900-$1,200) depending on location and the size of the room. Also, a lot of places are located nearby CSULB so your daughter can take public transportation to get to class! A lot of kids who don't live at home utilize this method of apartments + public transportation. \n\n I know it might sound scary for your daughter as it is a Facebook group and may not seem safe, but rest assured many people have found great housing options here. I would definitely tour the place before you ever sign anything, obviously, and meet the roommates if possible! \n\nGood luck and CSULB is a great school! Don't let the dorming options bring you down!",

One in particular was able to dorm all 4 years by applying to be an RA and it was pretty convenient for her. Another friend was able to afford an apartment by roomating with one of the other girls in her suite. i would recommend checking out the CSULB Roomate Finder group on Facebook, there are tons of posts of students who want to sign their leases off to other students who need the apartment or students trying to fins someone to roommate with them, or another option is looking for an apartment in one of the surrounding cities if possible.",

It sounds like a frustrating situation, but it feels like high rent is the average these days. I definitely wish it wasn\u2019t so.\n\nMight want to start keeping an eye out a group of friends to rent with\u2026create and post a flyer here on Reddit looking for potential roommates, sooner rather than later. Like others have said, houses in the area rent for cheaper than dorms or living in a hotel..,the daily price of the hotel is more than living alone, and living alone off campus without friends freshman year does suck. It\u2019s a good life practice for her to rent an apartment and live on her own....",

Of course, this phenomenon isn't unique to CSULB.\n\nI would say I apologize for the issue, but I am not. Instead, I will say that I support affordable housing measures so that the burden doesn't rest on any one person but instead on our collective ability to achieve that goal. Solidarity!",

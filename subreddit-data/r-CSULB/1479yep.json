Is there a possibility of me choosing Parkside North?",

Like me, for example, I didn\u2019t have a roommate by the time it was time for me to pick my room so I selected a room that already had one occupant. That person then became my roommate. You could always select a room that doesn\u2019t have any occupants in it yet, but it\u2019s very likely someone who is also without a roommate will select that room also and be your new roommate.",

    "postText": "So i needed to take a class from D2 Ge category as academic requirement state and took ASAM 120 cause [https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/ge-approved-courses-category-d](https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/ge-approved-courses-category-d) said so.   \nApparently the academic requirements says    \n**U.S. CONSTITUTION &amp; AMERICAN IDEALS - CATEGORY D.2**\u00a0   \nand the website says   \n**Social Sciences and Citizenship: GE category D2**  \nUnfortunately I have already taken social sciences and citizenship section. I wrote an email to complain about the issue but would they clear my requirement? So frustrated at the moment because ASAM 120 was writing intensive and time consuming and by the fact that I completely WASTED my money and time",

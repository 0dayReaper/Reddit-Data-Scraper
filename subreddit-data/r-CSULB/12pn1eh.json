    "postText": "I'm taking Biol 208 with Gardner for Fall 2023 (section 09B for lecture and 14B for lab), and I wanted to take an S/I course. At this time, only S/I for the lab portion is offered, and it says \"Must enroll in BIOL 208,01A, #5072 (TTh 9:30- 10:45 AM).\"\n\nStupid question, but does that mean I can't take this S/I course since my class isn't in that section?",

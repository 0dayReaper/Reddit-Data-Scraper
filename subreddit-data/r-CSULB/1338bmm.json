You\u2019ll get the hang of it though after a month or two. \n\nI already had a feeling I would get accepted here because I had the advantage of being a student from LBUSD, but I was still pretty excited when I got the acceptance email. \n\nThe first week of the semester I took a walk around most of the campus to get familiar with the place, to look at the different views, and to scout out potential study spots that I can hang out at in between classes.",

So for me this is my last semester at school and these are the advice for you: Always double check the classes on your planner the ones advisor put on for you because one time I had a class there that I didn't need it so I reach to my advisor to  remove it; for the first week of class I will suggest you to get early to campus so that you get the chance to see were you classes will be and be on time on your classes; take the gwar exam(is an exam where you will have to write an essay) asap so that you will already know how many writing clases are you going to take. Congratulations and Welcome to the Beach!! Good Luck!",

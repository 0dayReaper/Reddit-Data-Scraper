            "comment": "I went there last year. They usually have a theme and questions are based on that and you discuss with your group your responses. \n\nThe cocktail tables have about 2--4 people (including yourself) and the long tables have about 6 people (including yourself). You don't get paired 1-1 with anyone. It's really more of a group thing and if you click with anyone from the various groups you end up with, then you can exchange contact information. They had stickers at the sign in table where you choose what you're there for, example: just looking to make friends, heterosexual relationships, LGBTQ+, etc.\n\nIt did not work for me because they allowed too many people who were \"just looking for friends\" and there were too many members of the LGBTQ+ members. It lowered my chances of finding a heterosexual male that was interested in a romantic relationship. I was consistently ending up in a group where there was only 1 male and the rest females. Women outnumbered men during the event. There were more 1st year and 2nd year students compared to 3rd, 4th or grad students. The questions felt less like a dating event and more of a friendship event. \n\nThere is already a separate event for Speed Friendship for those who are looking for new friends. There is also a separate event specifically for the LGBTQ+ community.",

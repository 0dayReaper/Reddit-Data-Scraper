    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nApologies if this is a silly question or if I\u2019m missing something. I applied for FAFSA before the March 2nd deadline. I know that I\u2019m eligible but it doesn\u2019t show up on my student center. Do I need to register for classes for the coming fall semester first? Or when? I also have a full ride scholarship but when I click on \u201cView Financial Aid\u201d, it says I have no financial aid awards available. Why is that? I\u2019m just worried about it.",

She said that us returning students will not see our packages until June or July.",

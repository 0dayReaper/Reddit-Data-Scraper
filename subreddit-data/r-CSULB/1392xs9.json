            "comment": "You basically need to write an essay(I did 1 intro 5 body, and 1 conclusion paragraphs) based on the prompt they gave you during that time. You can take it either in-person or online. I just took mine (in-person) last Saturday, it was easy just answer the question they are asking and use the sources they provide to back your claims/answer. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re taking it in-person they will put you based on your number in the line. For example if you wanted to be sitted on the back then check in 5 mins before it starts but when you want to sit in the front then be there 20-30 mins before it starts.",

I took mine online, but had to go to the computer lab bc chromebooks are not compatible with the lockdown system. Personally I dont think the test is hard you just have to have a clear stance on the argument they give you and have evidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry taking it as soon as you can bc it can affect your class schedule and cant graduate without it, I think you can take on during summer check the gpe page",

    "postText": "Hi. Has anyone here ever received parent plus loans? Usually they come in paper checks because they have to be named under your parent. \n\nIf you have, how long did it take you to receive them in the mail?\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting on mine for the ones coming from Spring and it was disbursed a long time ago but for some reason it\u2019s still not here. Financial aid office can\u2019t help me.",

My parent wasn\u2019t registered in my e-refunds and the refund has to be sent to her, so they ended up sending a paper check.\n\nBecause parent plus loans are supposed to go straight to the parent, not to the student.",

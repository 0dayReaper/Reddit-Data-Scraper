Speak coherently and confidently and you should be good for the minimum.\n\nAs for what to expect, you get a text source and an image source. [Resources here](https://www.csulb.edu/academic-advising-at-csulb/graduation-writing-assessment-requirement-gwar/gwar-resources) but one is a docx. The other one is a pdf, [linked here](https://www.csulb.edu/sites/default/files/document/gpeworkshopbooklet_2021.pdf), that has samples and a different rubric, but it should be fine.",

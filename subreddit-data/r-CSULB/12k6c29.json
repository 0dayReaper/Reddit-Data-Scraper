            "comment": "Hey! Same here, I am a first-gen and will be starting the Criminology Masters program at CSULB in the fall. I did my undergrad here and my experience with the CJ faculty has been great. They really care about the field and they have a lot of knowledge in regards to it. In addition, if you are interested in getting your PhD I believe the only university in California that offers a PhD in criminal justice is UC Irvine. Some of the professors I have had had gone here for their PhD, so that can be helpfully. Like stated earlier, I have not participated in the graduate program yet so I can not necessarily give any pros and cons based off personal experience. I have discussed the program with professors and two things I have learned is that (1) the program is really affordable, idk how much less when compared to other schools, and (2) I was told its one of the best graduate programs for CJ, in the western United States. Furthermore, idk that much about it but our criminology department is in a program called Western Society of Criminology (WSC) where they meet in different cities in the western United States and western Canada. I believe this whole program is about presenting research in regards to criminology. I think as a graduate student you may have a chance of participating to show case any research you may be doing with a professor, but I am not entirely sure. \n\nI feel you as in getting nervous as it gets closer, but I like to think of it as a good nervousness, lol. If you are starting in Fall 2023, I have a question as in if you have gotten your registration date yet? lol I have not gotten mine yet and have not received any emails in regard to registration.",

Wish you the best of luck throughout your school journey. \n\nI haven\u2019t gotten the registration date yet. From what I understand is that we\u2019re suppose to be getting it anytime this month (early April) but have not gotten any updates yet.",

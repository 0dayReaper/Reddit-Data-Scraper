If instructors choose to use online/remote proctoring software (e.g., Respondus Monitor), instructors must also provide alternative assessments for students who prefer not to share their screens (privacy concerns) or cannot share their screens (equity issues).  Academic Technology Services has posted suggestions for alternative assessments and for the appropriate use of online/remote proctoring services and similar programs.\"\n\nEdit: To add this\n\"However, if a student expresses concerns related to privacy or equity, they must be allowed to turn off their cameras during online synchronous meetings. Instructors may ask students to add their photo to their CSULB Zoom account profile to show a photo when their cameras are turned off. \"",

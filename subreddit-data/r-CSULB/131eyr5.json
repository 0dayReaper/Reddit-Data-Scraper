            "comment": "I recommend taking a stroll down Second Street. Tons of food places and little shops- there\u2019s even a CSULB store down there that has different stuff from the one on campus. My fave place to eat down there is Taco Shore! Walk on the beach right there, look at the oil islands. If you\u2019re looking to eat by campus, go to Rascals (teriyaki bowls, super good) or Great Mex (awesome deals). Another thing I love about Long Beach is the public parks. They\u2019re everywhere and they\u2019re all so beautiful! On campus you can check out the pyramid and Japanese Garden, just make sure to check hours and reservations online. Hope you enjoy your visit!",

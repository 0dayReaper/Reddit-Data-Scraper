    "postText": "Hey yall just trying to figure out how CAPS works because I've only just now realized that some of the thoughts my brain is having are \"not normal\" or whatever lmaoo. I know this is super late in the game (one week left yippee) so I probably won't get any help anytime soon unless that have anything over the summer (which they probably don't lol). This is more just so I have a better grasp of what CAPS can do for me if/when I finally do make an appointment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Do you get only 6 visits total for the entire time that you're enrolled at CSULB? (Should I be saving up these visits for a more serious crisis??) Or is it like a 6 visits per semester type deal? I've seen some people say it's a case by case thing, and depending on what they think you need, they'll give you more visits or less visits? I really don't know, just real lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* From what I understand from the website, you call or walk in to schedule an initial consultation, and then after that initial consultation, they help pair you with either individual counseling or a group counseling? Correct me if I'm wrong please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Has anyone done group counseling? I was kinda interested since the website said it was good for interpersonal issues/having trouble connecting with people. But when I searched up what some other people were saying on this subreddit, some people said it was mostly like you talked about your problems and other students gave you advice? And then you'd have to turn around and do that same for them?? Idk just kinda confused and would love to hear from someone who has done group counseling somewhat recently (especially since a lot of the posts I read were pretty dated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I heard that CAPS was mainly good for issues that weren't too \"deep\" for lack of a better word. Like just general anxiety about school, or stress about a job, or whatever versus stuff that's heavier. Is this true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If anyone is willing to share, has anyone ever talked about intrusive thoughts/passive ideation with a counselor here before? I've heard too many horror stories about counselors snitching lmaoooo. CAPS website's statement about their confidentiality btw:\n\n&gt;*\" Disclosure of information is required in circumstances where there is reasonable suspicion of abuse of children or elderly persons; where the client is likely to harm herself or himself unless protective measures are taken; or where the client presents a clear and serious danger of  violence to another. \"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How long does one session usually last? An hour? I've had very little to practically no experience with counseling so I have only the faintest understanding of how it's all gonna go down ToT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if you don't have answers to my questions, any kind of insight or experiences would be awesome.

            "comment": "Hi. I participated in group counseling at CAPS last semester after experiencing a grief spiral. I experienced losing 3 family members in 1 year\u2019s time and the 3rd loss happened a day before fall semester started. \n\nIn my experience, grief group was incredibly helpful for me. Connecting with other students and understanding that other people are going through similar things as me was really eye opening. And there was no judgement. Everyone was really cool and supportive, and I was scared to join at first but I ended up being really happy I did. \n\nHey, you could just try it. If you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t have to continue.",

How big were the groups and was it the same students in the group each time? Did the CAPS people even mention how many sessions you were allowed to have?\n\nAlso were the sessions almost entirely student led? Or was there a counselor there to facilitate the whole thing?",

After that, I exclusively participated in the group sessions and opted not to do 1 on 1 counseling. My group was of 8 students, and as far as I know, a few of them were able to continue in group this semester!",

I didn't know that :O\n\nIf it's cool that I ask (only if you're fine sharing though!!)- for your first session did they kinda lead you by asking questions? Or did you have to initiate it yourself? Regardless I know that the time I have with them is limited so I'm trying to skip the small talk and jump straight into the issues lololol",

It was something I looked forward to every week.",

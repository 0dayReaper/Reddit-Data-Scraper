Also, there are summer classes and employees working on campus in June, so I\u2019m confused why you think this \u201caffects almost nobody.\u201d\n\nI get being critical of the university president, but scrutinizing every single piece of communication she sends is bizarre.",

Compared to the campus population during the spring semester, who this was emailed to, that is \"almost nobody\". \n\nThe academic calendar changes almost yearly in terms of which holidays are and aren't observed, and those have not been accompanied by a similar email.\n\nIn terms of timeline, there's ~a month in the semester, and sending the same email then would still be a month out from the date in question. It's not topical; there is arguably a rule.",

The university administration is highlighting it in order to affirm their support for that group. Just because it doesn\u2019t meet your standard for how many people it should apply to doesn\u2019t negate it\u2019s significance. This is literally what an \u201caffirmative action\u201d is; it is *affirming* support for a group that was not historically supported. It is *not negating* support for other groups. Sending this email *only* to people who would be affected by the campus closure in June is logistically complicated and also just pointless.\n\nAlso, just because an action is self-serving doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t still valuable. Literally anything any human does can be interpreted as self-serving. And of course as an administrator, she knows this gesture helps her public image. But it can be two things at the same time: self-serving *and* valuable to the people it benefits. Just because it benefits the president\u2019s public image doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t also benefit the Black students who are being affirmed.",

Same with city councils who have recently worked on it to make it a paid holiday for their staff. San Diego just announced making it a paid holiday for their staff a couple weeks ago. They probably just announced it so those who are involved with summer school are aware of it (students, faculty, staff) and to make adjustments now rather than hold on to the information until May.",

This seems to be a CSU-system-wide effort. There is certainly a reason that does not have to do with the graduation ceremony. Let me just try to convince you of one thing: the administrators could not care less about the students\u2019 reactions to the graduation ceremony. It is important to you personally, but don\u2019t let that misguide you to think that it\u2019s a huge deal in general. I first enrolled at CSULB 13 years ago, left 5 years ago, and have been involved deeply in university affairs around the country since then. The administrators know you all will graduate, the next group will come next year, and over time people will stop caring. This kind of \u201ccontroversy\u201d does not even leave the tiniest scratch on them. It\u2019s insanely annoying. I know. But this isn\u2019t the basis for some nefarious public image campaign. They don\u2019t care that much.",

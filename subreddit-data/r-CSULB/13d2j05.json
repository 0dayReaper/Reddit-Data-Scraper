    "postText": "So I\u2019m now finishing my stay at the dorms and I just want to acknowledge how cheap this school really is \u2014 first off, they only run the heating system for a couple a months, after winter it just shut offs and oh yeah, they don\u2019t have an air conditioning system in most buildings either lmao. Also, in my building they have never changed the water filter for our drinking water.. it\u2019s been on yellow for a few weeks and now it\u2019s red.. oh yeah fyi to future dormers they aren\u2019t going to fix their ID card readers on the doors so you\u2019re going to get physical keys and if you lose its $150 fee or something like that lmao.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in the credential program and have one more semester before I do my student teaching. The issue is I already work at a private k-8 as an ELA Teacher. I sign my new contract soon. I was told by the head of the program that I can\u2019t use this school because it is a private school and I\u2019ll have to quit and do my student teaching at a public school. The paperwork I have filled out does not say that anywhere. In fact, the paperwork states \u201cTo student teach in your classroom, you must teach at least three (3) classes in the subject that will be on your teaching credential, and you must be located within the CSULB service area. Candidates must be approved via the Petition Committee to use a current position for student teaching\u201d.\nAs long as I meet those requirements why would they say no? Has anybody else has a problem like this?",

            "comment": "This is because private schools do not teach the state curriculum.\n\nYou are in the SS Credential program to receive a state teaching credential for the state of California, teaching the CA K-12 Standards. Private schools do not follow the same standards, they can teach literally whatever they want. I say this kindly, but private schools will hire anyone with a degree, it doesn\u2019t mean you are receiving a qualified master teacher that will meet the needs of CSULBs Teaching Credential Program.\n\nI\u2019m sure if you pled your case about having an offer of employment , they might make some sort of concession, but I would not be surprised if they deny your request. For example, I asked to complete my student teaching in the Newport Mesa School district since I commute, I was initially told no because they wanted me to stay within the Long Beach Unified School system. I had to have department approval. However, I was not allowed to work at all..even though I was already a full time substitute. The program wants you to focus on student teaching and passing the TPA.\n\nThere is a reason why CSULBs teaching credential program is so rigorous. You cannot work at the place you\u2019re teaching. You cannot work at all during student teaching.  Teachers in the program have are required to adhere to the CA State Standards. Private Schools do not. I would say do your best to find a public school that you like in order to finish the program.",

During finals week they do have therapy dogs and free food and activities at the USU. We have the Farmers Market on Tuesdays, and they have various events with free stuff and good food. We now have a kitchen where you can take cooking classes. Everything is just a bus ride away so you can go off campus to different areas nearby. The gym also has personal student trainers, group classes, indoor track, outdoor pool, and rock climbing. \n\nHot take: We currently do not have a traditional graduation ceremony but I personally do not care. If you identify with an ethnicity you can do the cultural ceremonies and those are more interesting and it\u2019s actually held on campus.",

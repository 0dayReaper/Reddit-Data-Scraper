Computer Science here at CSULB hasn\u2019t been great lately, and COVID hasn\u2019t helped. This is a major that has massive ROI, and you get substantially more value from UCSD. Some computer school rankings place UCSD\u2019s computer science program around 10th to 15th in the nation, while being much more affordable than those higher on the list, save for Berkeley. UCSD is a great school for Computer Science, and you\u2019ll get a lot more opportunities there but get a lot more value. Normally I would strongly advise saving money and getting the bang for your buck with a Cal State, but in this particular instance, I think even with the extra debt, UCSD would be worth your while. I would recommend looking into potential scholarship, and I\u2019m assuming with this question you don\u2019t anticipate getting any financial aid, but I would strongly consider UCSD. Congrats on your acceptance to both programs tho!",

I think it goes without saying that UCSD is a better school and you're lucky to get in because its getting even more competitive. I don't know about the money though, it may not be worth it if you can't afford it. Honestly, you need to ask some advisor about that question, maybe even pay one. Also UCSD probably much harder than CSULB class wise so you probably will be able to better grades at CSULB.",

It's more about how you maneuvered yourself through school while gaining the professional experience outside of class, such as internships, and organizations. School teaches you how to learn, but now how to work in a professional setting. \n\nBack to the masters. Go to r/MBA and you'll find school rank makes a big difference in terms of salary and where employers are seeking their candidates. No so much for undergrad.\n\nWith all this said. CSULB is a great school, but will be a different vibe from UCSD, since it is a commuter campus",

For example I was going to commit to Cal Poly SLO but I changed my mind at the last second bc a company recruiter said they would prefer I go to a more local school and continuously intern rather than go to the \u201cbetter\u201d school. HOWEVER I am an engineering major so this might not be the same for your major. One con I can say for both schools is the social life. CSULB sucks cuz it\u2019s a commuter school so it\u2019s harder to make friends. I have a friend who is currently attending UCSD and she said the school is awesome but the only thing it lacks is diversity AKA the school has a lot of Asians. She a Hispanic girl in a male dominated major so she said she just felt like people like her weren\u2019t being represented enough and it made her feel lonely. But to, something like this might not matter to you. But I would say go where your heart tells you, you know where you belong :).",

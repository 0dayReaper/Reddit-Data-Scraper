Gonna have all the computer science courses for transfer completed and enough quarter units, but a lot of CSUs don't even offer CS as a major for spring transfers. I couldn't find anything like that for CSULB on their website so do they have the same majors offered for both fall and spring? Please lmk thanks :)",

It's kinda last minute for this semester(or maybe not, look into it) but you dont really wanna rush through this major achievement milestone, especially since you didn't get a celebration out of high school. Take your time, maybe get involved with the cultural group you identify with, and help plan your graduation! Congratulations!!!\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73",

It wasn't all day, and she was done by around 1130am pacific with her schedule on advising day.   Orientation is supposed to be the full 830-330 however",

The details of your daughter\u2019s process is outlined in a series of emails from her center, UCUA, that were sent to her personal and BeachMail/Outlook (https://myapps.microsoft.com) accounts. \n\nAll advising centers are doing registration differently, so the process is determined if you\u2019re a first-year or transfer student, as well as your declared major. It\u2019s confusing because there isn\u2019t a consistent model. \n\nOrientation is offered as an on-campus experience and is an all-day event from 8:30am-3:00pm. A reminder will be sent to her BeachMail two days before her scheduled orientation date. Call 562.985.5515 if you have any questions. Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hi! I am currently trying to fit all of the major-specific requirements/ my ast in one year as it took me some time to decide on a major and I got all my gen eds done. By spring I will have 2 required classes and one recommended I still need to finish. Would cramming these classes in one year/ still having a few left in spring affect my chance of admission? I would be getting 2 major classes done in the summer and 3 done in the fall. \n\nThanks!",

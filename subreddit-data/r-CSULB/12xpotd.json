I had gone to a good high school where we were required to graduate with a few AA degrees and I can say any student pursuing any additional degree DEFINITELY stands out and shows they are hard working. In my case I had failed two previous classes and was worried how that would affect my chance at getting in yet here I am. I do understand that your student isn\u2019t officially \u201cattending\u201d yet so your worried about how their acceptance might be affected. From what I\u2019ve experienced and those around me have, one bad grade won\u2019t make or break your acceptance. If he has a high GPA and took challenging classes I\u2019m sure the school will look over ONE bad grade. Again I can\u2019t speak for all cases but from the few I have had experience with this seems to be the case. If you still feel uneasy you could always bring it up as a hypothetical to the admissions office. Of course your student should still try to get a good grade but from what you said about them I doubt it will affect anything other than them repeating a class.",

            "comment": "&gt; half way to receiving his AA degree\n\nTL;DR: Having dual enrollment might outweigh the failing, not to mention the local school status. You're free to bug admissions, though.\n\nSo this is actually a question I'm trying to work with from data from the [Institutional Research and Analytics](https://www.csulb.edu/institutional-research-analytics) here at CSULB (I am not affiliated with the campus/IRA beyond being a student at this university). More explicitly, I'm trying to determine how much of an impact dual enrollment has on admissions, but it's a bit sloppy since I don't *quite* have the skill to isolate it, and it's not rigorous enough for me to say it's a cause. Admissions would probably explicitly confirm they take it into consideration, though how much of an effect it has is a separate question.\n\n**Summary**  \nAs it turns out, FTFY with transfer GPAs (henceforth T-FTFY) had substantially higher chances of being accepted versus FTFY without transfer GPAs (henceforth NT-FTFY). Therein, T-FTFY are those high schoolers who dual enrolled, while NT-FTFY did not. Furthermore, I did not have specific class data: I could only draw conclusions based on whether or no an admission had a Transfer GPA at all, meaning students with anywhere from a single class to an entire associate's degree were combined into one category.\n\nExcluding an outlier year where there were significantly more T-FTFY for some reason, addressed below, the acceptance rate of T-FTFY is about 97%, compared to the 36% of NT-FTFY. In being \"half-way to receiving his AA degree,\" this implies that your student took dual enrollment classes, as AP/Honor classes do not give a student a transfer GPA. Aside that the UCs sort of disagree with me by lumping them anyway.\n\n**Notes**  \nT-FTFY being accepted more appears to partially be because the T-FTFY pool is smaller than the NT-FTFY pool. A giant surge in Fall 2019 did see T-FTFY rates decline: the number of T-FTFY jumps from about 327 to 10499, then goes back to 619 in 2020. I don't know how it happened, but without Fall 2019, it's about 458k students I'm looking at when excluding 2019, which even then, was about a 50% T-FTFY acceptance rate versus the 37% for NT-FTFY. Outside of the people who work at Admissions, it is impossible to predict ahead of time if there will actually be a giant increase like that.\n\nI've seen some students with really mediocre transfer and high school GPAs get in, e.g. a white biomed engineer with a transfer gpa of 1 and a high school gpa of 3.5 or an Asian compsci with a transfer gpa of 3.18 and a high school gpa of 3.16. I haven't determined if they might have just been in an easier major or other factors \u2014 the hope is more that the giant sample size means that it's enough people that it's reliable enough.\n\nIf someone wants the dataset, it's about 76mb, or I can just give directions on how to work IRA's Tableau.",

It shows more initiative and more capability of handling what is definitely college-level curriculum, workload, freedom, and pacing. Compared to APs, which many students would take because they're told to, I don't know of any high schools that offer 10 dual enrollment classes, so I'd think it would show admissions that he knows what to expect in college already. That fact indicates a pretty safe investment in accepting him, I'd think.",

He won\u2019t retake it in summer as it\u2019s not needed for his major and summer is too late to make a difference for the university. He also has local preferences for being in a local school district and is only required to meet the minimum qualifications for admission.",

Both schools are a big investment in terms of both money and time. Be confident in your path before you make the decision so you can take advantage of what they have to offer.

I got my User certification for AVID media composer through their editing classes which I felt put me one up above other applicants looking for jobs and the Film and Electronics department i felt did really well in terms of offering Networking opportunities with guest speakers. They also had a pretty good curriculum that i didn't feel like i was missing out on learning anything, granted some of the fine arts buildings looked outdated but the school i felt funneled the finances into the proper film tools such as editing programs, film equipment, and other resources. But that's my experience with CSULB, I was able to find an industry Job in a post production house in Hollywood within 3 months of graduating as head of archiving in my location and moved up to a media management technician assisting Online editors getting episodes prepped for them and doing VFX pulls.\n\nSo i would say my time at CSULB was worth it and definitely up to you on how you use the resources available to you.",

But for me a big point was that I wanted to feel comfortable for however much time I was going to spend on campus. And LB has a leg up on LA. The environment is great, clubs are great, people are friendly, and you have a lot to do in the surrounding areas. You just have to put yourself out there. Again, if we had a different president who actually cared about the student body I would recommend LB 100% of the time. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the president of LA doesn\u2019t have issues but Jesus, at least they got to walk.

    "postText": "So I\u2019m planning on taking Anatomy (BIOL 208) and PHYS 100B next semester, but I\u2019m scared it might be too much, so I want to prepare myself before the semester starts. I had Diego for 100A (which wasn\u2019t too bad), but I was wondering if he teaches 100B any differently. Also, how difficult is the content?\n\nCan anybody who\u2019s taken PHYS 100B with Diego Gutierrez share their past notes with me so I can look over, please?",

My friends who took both 100A &amp; B with him said it was basically the same deal as far as teaching goes. The content itself isn\u2019t harder than 100A, but it was less applicable since I am a KIN major so I was kinda checked out.",

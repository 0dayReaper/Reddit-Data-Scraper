If you ever happen to read other posts, most people tend to keep to themselves. I had a lot of problems with getting the classes I needed, even when they were absolutely essential. This happened pretty much every year until the day I graduated. \n\nA couple of the clubs for my major were run by like 5-6 people who weren't keen on accepting new members. For 3 years I would go to their \"intro\" meeting with usually more than 30 people wanting to get involved, but they would only select about 2-3 new people, but even then they got the short end of the stick.\n\nOverall, I just don't think it benefited me in the long run since I was never able to get a job in my major. I didn't attend my own graduation and I don't know what's become of my degree that was mailed to me.\n\nCSULB is suppose to be a good school for my major, yet I found my upper division classes kind of lacking in some areas and some of my friends struggled for over a year to get a job. I just gave up looking and went to do something else.\n\nIt was a very humbling experience and I would not be the person I am today without it. I just wish I didn't have to waste so much time and money for something that turned up for a big fat zero. I think about it everyday. What would be different if I had made another choice back then. Probably be debt free lol, amongst other things.\n\nIf you're still in school, I wish you the best. I hope you have all the success after years of hard work and that end somewhere you like. If you're an alumni, same thing.",

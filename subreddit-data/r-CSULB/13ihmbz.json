    "postText": "I applied to graduate before March 1st, (graduating Fall 2023) and I was wondering if it\u2019s expected to be receiving emails about the 2023 commencement even though I plan to commence in Spring 2024? I don\u2019t think the application process even asked me which semester I wanted to commence so I\u2019m a little confused and worried",

I think you have to wait for spring 2024 to walk.",

But I\u2019ve been receiving emails about spring 2023 commencement. Im wondering if this is normal",

Yeah it\u2019s expensive but at least you won\u2019t have to think of parking strats and will definitely always find a spot in G12, G13, and G14",

I parked there till I graduated and have not had an issue with them, some of the neighbors there are nice. No permit is required and it's a 10-15min walk depending on how fast you walk to the back of the school near the design building which is: E 9th St &amp; N Studebaker Rd Long Beach, CA 90815 you can park there all day if you need to. Now there's another one that's next to Bixby Hills apartment and Sato Academy high school but it's a 2-hour parking spot also no permit is required: just put \"Sato Academy of Mathematics and Science\" on Google Maps and it should take you a bit closer but still behind the school. No parking from 9am-6pm. After 6pm you can park there all night if you need to.",

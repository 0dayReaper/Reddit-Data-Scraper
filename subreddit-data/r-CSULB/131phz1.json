    "postText": "hey everyone, Im an Australian uni student looking at doing exchange to the US next year, one of the colleges I\u2019m considering is CSULB. I just have some questions I was hoping to get answered. Thank you in advance :)\n\n1. Is CSULB socially dead?\n2. How close to good surf is the campus, would it be easy for a student to travel with their board to the beach without a car?\n3. Is it more of a commuter college or do most people live on/near the campus?\n4. Is it easy to travel from the campus to other areas of Long beach without a car?\n5. What is Long Beach like as a city?\n6. When would be the best time to come? Spring or Fall semester\n7. Is there any other CSU campuses you would recommend for an exchange student?",

            "comment": "1. I wouldn\u2019t consider csulb socially dead at all. There\u2019s tons of on campus events, active clubs, ect. It\u2019s pretty easy to make new friends\n2. CSULB is about an 8 minute drive from the closest beach. There\u2019s tons of buses that could take you though\n3. I would definitely say that it\u2019s a commuter campus. About 3k students live on campus, but the majority of commuters live within 5-15 minutes of the school. So everyone is pretty local. \n4. If you use public transportation or lyft/uber, it\u2019s pretty easy to get pretty much anywhere in long beach \n\nonly other question i can rlly answer is that fall is very hot but perfect at the beach, spring is colder + rainy but the flowers and nature around here is extra beautiful",

            "comment": "1. Plenty of social events if you\u2019re outgoing and a joiner \n2. About 4mi from beach- you can take the bus\n3. Lots of people on campus and nearby rents\n4. Good bus system/transit\n5. Long Beach has a good social scene-arts district, bars, clubs\n6. Fall has more beach weather-it\u2019s warm through November. Spring has more wet weather. \n7.SDSU in San Diego for more surf/beach; Humboldt is coastal but woodsy, Chico is social/remote but alternative",

No need to go to class because the recorded lectures are word for word the same and he\u2019d rather us watch them. The papers literally tell you line by line what to write so easy 100 (and anyone who says differently did not read the instructions). The exams can be a bit tricky but all the info is from the lectures just take good notes during and the exams are all online. I\u2019m on a 95+ec% going into the final",

The class is interesting and he seems like a laid back prof but if its online make sure you watch his lectures and actually take notes. If u do then you\u2019ll pass cuz his tests are lecture based and j follow the rubric for the papers and you\u2019ll be good. \n\nBut if u don\u2019t like the subject or dont thrive in online courses where you have to set time aside to watch lectures then it might be harder.",

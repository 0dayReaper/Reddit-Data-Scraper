    "postText": "Long story short, I currently have a bad case of strep throat and my doctor gave me a doctors note to stay home the rest of the week. I have a midterm this Thursday and the only way to reschedule it for my class is to send my professor a doctors note. But when I asked him he said I need to contact SHS, send them the note and they\u2019ll send it to my professor. I\u2019ve never used SHS services before so would I just email them the instructions my professor basically gave me or is there a different process about contacting SHS. \nThank you!",

Maybe the professor doesn\u2019t know how excused absences work. I don\u2019t think SHS handles things like doctor\u2019s notes.\n\nMaybe because you are asking to be excused from an exam, the professor wants SHS to verify the note is legit by calling your doctor to verify? This seems weird to me.",

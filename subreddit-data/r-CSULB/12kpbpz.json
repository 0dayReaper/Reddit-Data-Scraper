    "postText": "Has anyone had experience transferring from one of these to the other? \nI'm having a difficult time trying to figure out where to transfer from CC. This is my last semester at a CC and I am trying to choose between CSULB and CSUSM, where I both got accepted . I am a marine bio major and would therefore want to go to CSULB. However, I am being offered potential marine bio research at CSUSM. There are other factors but I was wondering how hard would it be if I try to transfer from CSUSM as a junior for a biology degree to CSULB for a marine biology degree. (Those are the degrees I have been accepted to to start with in the fall).",

If you want to get your degree at csulb, just go to LB. Also, I don\u2019t think they allow junior-&gt; senior transfers, you may have to complete at least two years at LB to get your degree. If you value the research opportunity more than anything, go to CSUSM, other than that go to LB, but stay at the college",

It can be done, but i credit it mostly to me being extremely persistent  about pushing for credit approval and course equivalencies. Its a major pain in the ass, I was not granted equivalencies for ALL of my major courses, and my degree (psychology) is very common. I cant imagine how much more (or less) marine bio/bio would be so I cant say it would be the same for you. Obviously you never know why experience you\u2019ll have until you have it, I heavily agree to pick and stick to a school, as I have seen how complicated transferring can be in so many aspects. \nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, this fall semester will be the 3rd year at Long Beach and this up coming fall semester I\u2019ve been thinking of getting a dorm for spring (since I was late for fall semester dorms)\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure if I should fully commit to dorms. How\u2019s social life at CSULB? I feel like commuting to school and making friends has been hard. How much is dorms if you don\u2019t mind and which building do you recommend? How do you find your roommates? I just want to see if dorms is the right fit for me. I\u2019m nervous",

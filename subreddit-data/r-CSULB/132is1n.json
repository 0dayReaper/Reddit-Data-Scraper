    "postText": "Hi guys, my wife is supposed to graduate on the 17th but the school is denying these students who have worked so hard to walk on stage, have their names called, and shake hands with Administration. With that said, I'm looking for other students who feel robbed of having an actual graduation and want to join the mini graduation I'm secretly throwing for her at a park. I'm going to order a stage with a podium, chairs, balloon arch and hire a photographer but if more people want to join we can order more chairs and things. Let me know if yall have any questions.",

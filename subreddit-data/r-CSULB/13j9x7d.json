            "comment": "You absolutely must go and walk around both schools.\n\nIt would be  nutty to not check out the school you\u2019re going to attend.\n\nI would recommend going around lunchtime, so you can get a vibe for the food situation at each school too.\n\nGauging your general commute would also be wise to.\n\n\\- If you\u2019re not living on campus, commuting to school every day is a big part of the University process so try out the drive too.\n\nEach school is very different and has different layouts and building shapes. They both have areas of flat ground and steep hilly sections. It would be very wise to walk around all the areas of the campus\u2026see if you can handle the elevation or if you need to make accommodations.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve spent time at both schools. Definitely leaning towards LB for aesthetics. But really, who cares what the school looks like? It\u2019s like getting a tattoo. At first you notice it, but overtime it blends in and becomes part of your natural life. Do what you feel most comfortable with doing. *Don\u2019t make important life choices based on aesthetics.* You will have to live with this choice.\n\nHowever, both schools have their pros and cons. Aesthetically speaking, CSULB feels more cohesive to me\u2026 Fullerton is a bit more expansive and large so it can feel like a giant community college with the commuter vibes for the most part. LB also had commuter vibe.\n\nTo me,  CSULB feels a tiny bit more like a full time on-campus university with people who spend time on campus after their classes. But not by much.\n\nFullerton is usually a ghost town all day long, whereas Long Beach usually has more people on campus, but it usually clears out after sunset.\n\nI will say this, Fullerton has a much better graduation experience. They give each college its own ceremony with its own terms on how they host. it\u2019s more intimate with just the people from your major. Each major gets to decide on the day and how they run their graduation\u2026compared with Long Beach\u2019s mass graduation event that really feels like a cattle call, they could care less. comparatively, LBs ceremony feels more impersonal at graduation but it\u2019s more traditional with \u2018pomp and circumstance\u2018.Ultimately, your choice should be about the quality of your class experience, for my major, my experience was much much better at LB.\n\nif you\u2019re feeling a bit conflicted, maybe start at one school but consider taking classes at both schools. it is possible, I did it myself out of necessity because I couldn\u2019t get a class I needed so I had to dual enroll, but it really made me realize how much I like LB and why I liked it.",

Personally I fw the LB view and vibe more, but that\u2019s just my personal preference.",

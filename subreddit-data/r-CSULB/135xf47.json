    "postText": "I made some unpopular comments on this subject a few months ago and I am sure this will be no different, but I think it's important to learn from failures.\n\n1. The internet is not real life. Getting 15K+ people to digitally sign an online petition doesn't mean anything. That translated into a *maybe* 20 person picnic protest.\n\n2. You have to have a message. This is how the majority of the discourse surrounding the dilemma went:\n\nStudents: We want to walk!\n\nAdministration: No.\n\nStudents: Oh yeah? But we WANT TO WALK!\n\nAdministration: No.\n\nRepeat. The End.\n\n3. You have to have bargaining power. Because the message was so, put politely, juvenile, administration never even had to consider the request. There was no research conducted to find out more about the contract with the stadium, no data on alumni donations or how this might impact it, or no information regarding if this could potentially impact applicant decisions. \n\n4. Being loud and having a strong argument are not the same things.\n\n5. Meaningful change takes a ton of information, a ton of hard work, and a ton of people. This \"campaign\" had none of that and the results are self-evident.\n\nI wish we could have walked, I really do. My family isn't even coming to the ceremony now because of how impersonal it is. I hope future attempts are better thought out.",

It's well done with good editing and production. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/KCfzvjFYdXY\n\nAnd you can't expect anyone to know about the contract with Anaheim stadium because it was a private agreement. No amount of investigation will uncover private documents",

Then you'd have to gain enough traction to get that many people *and* their families to agree with it.

Seems like some people love to criticize without lifting a single finger to truly help push the movement forward. \n\nSince you clearly have no idea what kind of time and effort went into this movement which could have been \u201cbetter thought out,\u201d here\u2019s an idea: \n\nI made the time to sit down and write the petition, I made the time to design the flyers, start the gofundme, to raise money. I drove to Burbank to pick the flyers up and spent hours putting them up around the school. I made the time to speak on the phone with the Long Beach Post, the Long Beach Press-Telegram, the LA Times, Beachcomber news, I made the time to meet with NBC4, etc. I made the time to create the Instagram and run it, I made the time to send countless emails, create the entire Linktree packed with resources on how to help, I researched email contacts for university administrators and local government officials, and wrote email drafts for others to copy and paste. I took the time to write a 1 minute public comment and skipped class to speak at the CSU Board of Trustees meeting, I spent my own money on materials for the protest, I spent 5 hours at the library with other students making posters. I skipped class to attend the first protest. I took the time to buy the snacks for the 2nd protest/picnic. These are only a few of the things I\u2019ve personally done, and don\u2019t forget on top of this I am also a graduating senior studying molecular biology and working in a lab on campus. \n\nThis is not an attempt to take full credit for anything. But clearly you genuinely have no idea what has gone into this, probably because you haven\u2019t contributed a single thing this entire time. Many other students have also been putting an IMMENSE amount of effort into this whole ordeal. Other students have ALSO been skipping class to work on the movement, taking the time to participate in interviews, many students were in the library for hours helping with posters, etc. Students have MADE the time to help. They\u2019ve donated money, they\u2019ve sent emails, they\u2019ve reached out to professors, etc. Students have been doing the absolute best they can. \n\nTo address your comment about the movement\u2019s lack of research/information: are you kidding? Have you even bothered to read the Daily 49ers special issue on commencement? This issue goes BEYOND our movement. Have you seen the research done by other students into the financial aspects of commencement? The video outlining this entire situation with interviews from the president of CSUF as well as Pres Conoley? Look into that. \n\nYou genuinely haven\u2019t done anything to help this movement at all. Sure, you\u2019re entitled to your own opinion. But if you\u2019re the same person who came into the Discord server 2 months after the movement started to criticize us and give terrible suggestions like \u201cyou should be camping outside of Conoley\u2019s car every night\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Get a grip. \n\nWe did the best we could. We can\u2019t force people to attend protests. We can\u2019t force people to boycott the ceremony. At the end of the day, we just can\u2019t make people care, and we truly did the best we could given the time and the resources we had. There is absolutely no way you could have done a better job than us. Too bad you were too busy sitting on your couch telling us what you think we should be doing instead of actually lending a helping hand towards the cause.",

You want us to do all of these unrealistic things like go outside of jane's house with a beat box and a hot dog cart. This is all stuff you told us to do in the discord server btw. You are acting like we don't have our own lives, such as having to study and work. We truly tried everything we could without endangering our reputations at the school. Yes, it sucks that out of all those people who signed the petition, only like 15 showed up to our picnic protest, however, that is NOT OUR FAULT. At the end of the day, we cannot make people actually care about the graduation ceremony. It seems that a lot of the students in this school actually don't care about the ceremony which blows my mind. We worked really hard but we can't do the impossible which is making people actually care. There were only about 25 of us I would say that truly took this campaign really seriously and sadly, that is not enough people to make an impact. You all should blame yourselves for not caring, not the people who started this campaign and wanted to make an actual change. Our campaign was on multiple news outlets such as ABC, NBC, and telemundo. We were also on multiple newspapers, so we definitely did try.",

Not walking isn't a big deal. I'm a veteran and work and go to school and I don't think it's a big deal\"\n\nNo, actually, the other person said, and this is a direct quote, not your kind of sort of fuzzy memory from a thread two months ago that happens to align with the picture you are trying to paint, \"I feel like people who share this idea like you are people who didn't really try in college and don't care about college in general. For people who actually worked their asses off in college, they want to be acknowledged for their accomplishment of going through 4 years of constant studying and hard work.\"\n\nMe bringing up that I am a vet and worked full time while going to school full time so that I could actually transfer to a university was a response to the false claim that \"if you don't care, you don't try hard.\"\n\n&gt;His original post was like \"why do people care so much???\"\n\nNo, my original post was \"Anybody else kind of meh on the whole graduation ceremony drama?\" because you literally were not allowed to say anything to that extent in person. \n\n&gt;And then in the comments anyone that answered why they cared he was like \"Its not a big deal, get over it. You're childish\". Nothing he said in this post was brought up elsewhere. He even deleted most of his comments and stuff from that post because it was down voted alot\n\nNo, I wrote that the absolute *hysterics* that people were going through including statements like \"why did I even get a degree, it barely feels worth it\" or \"the administration hates us\" were juvenile overreactions to not getting the exact graduation ceremony you wanted. I still stand by that. It also ties into my point regarding the childish messaging where real adults aren't going to take you seriously when you stomp your feet, pout, and make ridiculous claims like your college education not being worth it because a president you hate didn't call your name. \n\n&gt;This whole post is rewriting history because he never posted about any of this stuff.

The funny thing about Reddit and real life is that people exist outside of when you interact with them Mr. Main Character.

This post is alot of retroactive change to his original post.",

Once the sting of not walking fades (which, I promise you all, it will), this is a very valuable learning experience. \n\nYou don't know what you don't know and early 20-somethings thinking they know it all is NOT new or unique to the people who had the best of intentions with this protest. Now we know not to place as much value in online discourse. Now we know that we need to have tangible data. \n\nThat's learning. That's growth. That's what college is about.",

Y\u2019all both useless. \nTo OP, you\u2019re an ass who doesn\u2019t want to do any work but whine. You yourself don\u2019t have the \u201cstrategy\u201d you keep talking about. If you had a good one, everyone would\u2019ve listened. Don\u2019t give yourself too much credit for doing nothing LMFAO.\n\nTo the other dude sucking this guy off: First of all, you\u2019re late to the party, second of all, you don\u2019t get to have an opinion about how the movement ran because you were not in it. And you clearly didn\u2019t care enough \u201csooner\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re all students like you all are, we tried everything on our end. The OP wants us to get in front of Conoley\u2019s house and get a circus going on there, but that\u2019s not how it works, that\u2019s how you get arrested and get a bad rep. We didn\u2019t want to do anything that would have a finger pointing us while we point all ours at the admin. That\u2019s the last thing we wanted. Plus the OP assumes, we don\u2019t have life out of this movement and that BS. We atleast tried and publicly came forward. Not like the OP who is still anonymous and whines about \u201chis\u201d action plan that he wants everyone else to follow. We\u2019re not your servants, you can\u2019t just sit it out and give orders from the outside. If you wanted to get involved, you would have. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cuz you don\u2019t have a damn dick to. So STFU and let people do whatever they want. Don\u2019t whine about nothing now come on",

Overall it is what it is and honestly I don\u2019t even think we will ever win against administration bc at the end of the day they don\u2019t care about us. Thanks for trying regardless it was just irritating to think no one wanted to listen to some good advice but now I don\u2019t even know bc I\u2019ve read a lot about how the OP was an ass but then they say you guys were assholes so whatever.",

I wasn't going into the event looking for anything, nor was I expecting to win. however, I did end up winning the event and won a date with the girl. When it came time to meet her, she did not look pleased to see me. Afterward, we all got gift cards and the coordinator asked if we were going on a date. I didn't answer, but I looked at the girl to see how she would answer, and she remained silent. I don't want to throw shade at her at all, it was honestly the most polite way to go about it, but I was humbled really quickly. \n\nDays later, I saw one of the employees who was running the event again at the nugget, and we talked a little bit about the event. She was very sweet, and I assumed she was just a friendly/outgoing person. I went on tinder not too long after that and saw her on tinder. I was curious and swiped right, to which I was shown that we had matched. she messaged me shortly after, and I have not messaged her. It's my fault, I don't use tinder ever, I downloaded it for the ego boost, but I shouldn't have swiped right with the intention of not going on a date or anything, but I have seen her a couple of times while on campus. Again, she is very sweet, I just do not know how to carry myself on the internet. I ended up deleting tinder from my phone afterward.",

First time away from mom and dad, trying new things, discovering who we are.  Be wary, know your limits, be safe,  communicate,  be respectful of others, ask for consent, trust your gut.  Be yourself, you might find that perfect one,  you might not. You might actually be the one there mom warned them about,  as long as you're up front about who you are,  they won't be surprised. \n\nI've dated a few girls from here and most have had amicable endings.  \n\nUse the campsite rule:\n\nIf you\u2019re in a sexual relationship with somebody significantly younger or less-experienced than you, the rule that applies at campsites shall be applicable to you: you must leave them in at least as good a state (physically and emotionally) as you found them in. That means no \u00a0unwanted STDs, no pregnancy, not overburdening them with your emotional or sexual baggage, and so on. Younger partners and particularly virgins will often take everything given to them by an older, more experienced partner as being \u201cwritten in stone,\u201d and will carry around everything they learn from them for the rest of their life: so treat them right!",

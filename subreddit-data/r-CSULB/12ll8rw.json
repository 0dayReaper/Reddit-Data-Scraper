I think it's a relatively small class size so it might be better if you want more 1on1 time with teachers and stuff.\n\nAlso, when I was first looking into the program, I emailed/set up an appointment with Laurel Richmond (head of recreation I think?). I was able to ask her and one of the recreation therapy professors questions about the program which was really nice. So if u wanna learn more about the program, I'd probably start there. \n\nGood luck! :)",

Current lease ends 8/31 bit could potentially move in before depending on when my roommate moves out.\n\nRent + Bills = 1300\n\nthere is plenty of street parking but no lot as it is on a residential street\n\nIt's 2 miles away from CSULB \n\nThe room is unfurnished but all the living room/ kitchen furniture and the fridge belongs to me so those things will be there.\n\nLooking for someone female\n\nNo pets\n\nQuiet \n\nI don't mind guests as long as they are respectful and do not stay over.\n\nDM me here or Instagram u/ugonnechikezie",

Honestly, I'm not sure if there are any other forms that could be filled outside of FASFA (I'm looking at the Federal Student Aid site to see any options). I think you should go to the school's financial aid office in-person or email them again to see if they can forward you the form/more info. \n\nHope this helps!",

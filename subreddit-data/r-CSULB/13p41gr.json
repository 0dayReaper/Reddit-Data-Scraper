    "postText": "I applied for the MS Marketing Analytics Fast Track program back in January and still haven't heard back from the school in regards to being accepted. I called the school and spoke to a graduate business program advisor and he had told me not to worry about the acceptance because if my GPA was over a 3.0, I was guaranteed to get into the program. It's almost summer and I am still waiting to hear back from the school. Does it normally take this long for the school to let you know whether I've been accepted or not when going through the Fast Track Application process?",

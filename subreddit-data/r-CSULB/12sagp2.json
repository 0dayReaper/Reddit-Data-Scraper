    "postText": "Hey, I am an incoming freshman that is going into pre-mechanical engineering. \n\nI'd like to know what my schedule looks like for the first 4 semesters with my major and GE classes if someone could give me a rundown on what that would look like (maybe with some class recommendations too for GE)\n\nI also wanted to know if there was a flowchart for mechanical engineering, I only found one for aerospace. I know for the first two years, the classes are almost the same but I would still like to have it for later or for reference. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Grad student in me. If you aren\u2019t taking any prerequisite. 4 years is possible. Probably have to take 15-16 units a semester. Your freshman semester is probably calc1, English, Mae 172, maybe Mae 205, and an elective. That like 15 units. Mae 172 is the class you learn CAD like solid work or catia. Mae 205 is like MATLAB, just programming. Nothing really hard. You aren\u2019t learning how to do stress or fluid analysis using the cad. Just designing. For 205, the programming is real chill. Just how to make a program to calculate shit. \n\nYou start doing differential equations(which is the bread and butter of me) your second year. And expect to just do differential your third and fourth year \n\nThere used to be a flow chart when I was an undergraduate. I remember recently seeing a new one for the new undergraduates. You guys have more options( you have a bunch of substitutions). When I was an undergraduate, you follow the list of classes on the chart and there was no options to substitute",

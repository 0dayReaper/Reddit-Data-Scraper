    "postText": "Not exactly sure if this would be the place to look, but I am looking for people to join (preferably girls only) for off-campus housing close by campus. I am fine with rooming with more than one person since my budget is around $680-$700 a month. I tried joining Facebook groups, but it's hard to tell what is a scam and what isn't. I live like 2 hours way from LB so commuting isn't really an option for me either. \n\nFeel free to DM me on Instagram if you have anything @ nat\\_\\_\\_922",

If I withdrew from the course would my acceptance be affected. I\u2019ve asked counselors and have gotten mixed answers so I am not sure.",

Prior to transferring to CSULB school of nursing last year, I withdrew from a trigonometry course at my cc. Having a W does not impact your GPA. Furthermore, withdrawing from a course that is not needed for acceptance will not hurt you either.  This is my own personal experience.",

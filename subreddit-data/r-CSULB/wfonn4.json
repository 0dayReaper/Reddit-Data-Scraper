    "postText": "Hi. I noticed with school starting a lot of people have been sharing uncensored versions of their class schedules. Unfortunately, this also means that anyone on Reddit can know your exact location and daily schedule for the next several months. While I believe most people have good intentions. There are still people out there that could use this information to stalk or harass others. Stay safe. If you are going to share your schedule on social media, I strongly recommend censoring out the class times and locations.",

A more likely scenario is that if someone meets a person on campus who becomes a stalker they will try to find any social media that person has\u2026including Reddit. And if they get ahold of that person\u2019s entire schedule on Reddit that\u2019s a huge problem. Unfortunately at my community college I was stalked by a guy who memorized my entire class schedule, I didn\u2019t share my schedule online, but you also should not make it easier for dangerous people by sharing your schedule online. stalking and harassment on college campuses unfortunately is no joke. It\u2019s a real problem. This subreddit is filled with people who attend the same college campus as you.",

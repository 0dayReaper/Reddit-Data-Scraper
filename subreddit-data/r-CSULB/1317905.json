I went to OCMA, ate at my favorite restaurants (Chiang Rai has the BEST Thai food ever, I promise you.) and got all the pastries I could possibly digest (Porto\u2019s and Dough &amp; Arrow). I would say visit some destinations and see some views you\u2019ll miss. Go to the Korean Friendship Bell near sunset, find a hike somewhere near Torrance (I forgot the name of the place lolz) and soak up some sun at the beach. I really miss the weather down there and how every city has something to offer. Congrats on graduating OP! Good luck out there. :)",

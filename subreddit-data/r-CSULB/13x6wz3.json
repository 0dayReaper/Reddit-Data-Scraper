    "postText": "Apparently, I still not be approved for the financial aid, and they ask me to submit my Student Amended Tax Return Verification form which I did 17 days ago.\n\nHowever, I have some questions? (1) How long does it take for the SATR form to be approved? (2) After they approve my SATR form, does it mean I'm done, and I only need to wait for my financial aid to be available? (3) What happen if I miss financial aid deadline on June 14 (will I never get my financial aid for 2023-2024 cycle)?\n\nThank so much for reading through all of my concerns. Sorry for asking too much, coz I don't know who I can ask for help for this kind of issue.",

I kinda been dealing with emotional backloads so I've been really out of it besides like rsvp and the gradpass and the tickets and stuff like that, all that's fine. I mean more what do I need for the ceremony itself I guess. I can't not do it at this point cause family is flying in so like I'm just trying to gather stuff before it's too late.",

I ordered a plain black gown on Amazon and my friend lent me her cap just for cost effectiveness and I\u2019m only wearing it once so it didn\u2019t matter to me. \n\nSome other things you could purchase if you want the completed grad look:\n- CSULB sash (bookstore)\n- Tassel (bookstore or you can order one)\n- Honor Cord (bookstore, if you have honors)\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. And if you want to decorate your cap you can decorate it too :)",

I was wondering did anyone attend the Comm\u2019s department commencement if so how did it go and the process? I was thinking about attending the angel stadium one but I also know that csulb offers a lot of other alternative and small graduation ceremonies such as the cultural ceremonies. If you attended any of those pls let me know how it went! Thank u :))",

They have a little station there and you write down your email and they will send out the stuff you need to fill out. I would recommend signing up right away once they send out the forms since it fills up fast.",

One of the main reasons why I signed up was because I wanted to get my name called and they did exactly that, but it was even more special. I believe they sent an email sometime around march letting us know the dates and times of the graduation and when registration would begin. You should be able to google cultural graduation and see all the social, cultural graduations they have, they all opened up around mid april. If the ceremonies in the future continue to look like this the minute thsh send an email about when registration begins, I would register, the chicano/latino graduation filled up. They were pretty good about sending emails throughout the whole process!",

For individuals of Latin American descent, it's imperative to use the term Latinx instead of Latino or Latina. The terms Latino and Latina are inherently gendered and do not acknowledge the wide range of gender identities present within the Latin American community.\n\nWe, as a Latinx community, prefer the use of Latinx as it acknowledges and respects our diverse gender identities. It is crucial to prioritize the voices of marginalized communities, and using gender-neutral language is just one of the many ways in which we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Have a nice day!",

I keep thinking about whether the guy has seen that he's being memed about his situation and how he'd feel about it if he has. Don't get me wrong, I love memes and I totally understand the idea of laughing it off, but the poor guy got his car stolen at damn gunpoint. His life has changed big time and finals are coming up. His amount of stress I imagine to be that much more than someone who didn't get jacked. Just because he didn't get hurt makes it cool and appropriate to meme him? These things I feel are overlooked by the kiddos who fancy themselves comedians through memes and I gotta admit that its disappointing. I dunno...maybe I AM old but I cant help but to find it childish when bummer situations like these are perceived this way....fuck it, maybe It's just a thing of newer generations.  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI'm 29 and going back to school at CSULB this fall to finish my Bachelors in Finace finally!  I make pretty decent money right now working full time 9-5 M-F.  \nLuckily my wife makes really good $$ and is fully supportive of this but odds are if I'm serious about this I'm going to have to quit my job or find something part time. Just a couple questions for anyone with advice or who as also gone thru this.\n\n1. What are the night/online class options looking like? \n\n2. Any advice for good job recs for while in school? (I have 10+ years Retail Management experience so not trying to go back to that if I don't have too lol)\n\n3 any general advice for being a 30 year old going back to University? \n\nI'm fully committed to finishing this and being involved with CSULB throughout my time there. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Accept that this is your identity. This is what you do now, full stop. If you can accept that \u2018student\u2019 is now your default setting, the work you\u2019re putting in to complete your coursework won\u2019t be so daunting. Remember: you make time for what\u2019s important to you, so regardless of circumstance, if you can\u2019t study because you\u2019re doing other things, you\u2019re saying those other things are more important than school. If you\u2019re not ok with that balance, act accordingly.",

There\u2019s definitely online class availability, especially for GEs. I\u2019m not sure about for your specific major classes. \n\n3. my advice- remember you\u2019re not alone. You will feel older than basically everyone on campus but there are lots of people in their late 20s to even 60s finishing their degrees. Work hard and reach out to professors. They\u2019re usually more than happy to help",

Depends on your major but in my experience, most of my classes are between 10am - 7pm, with only a handful being offered past 5pm. I\u2019m not sure what online class options are like, I do know there is CSU Online here, but I think they limit you on how many classes you can take thru this program(?). I would suggest looking at what class you need for your degree, then looking up this upcoming Fall schedule of classes and this past spring schedule of classes to get an idea of how your classes will be offered. \n\n2.

I did a combination of online, zoom and late night classes. If you can find a job that can work around your schedule then you might not need to quit. Maybe speak to your employer to see if there\u2019s any flexibility? I did and I\u2019ve been able to adjust my starting/ending time. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve worked 9-5 the whole time; it\u2019s doable, but slower. I max out at 3 classes a semester (imo 2 is a more sustainable option) and only take online classes; I also attend summer and winter inter session so I won\u2019t be in school for 10 yrs for my bachelors \ud83e\udee0\n1. There is usually at least 1 option available as a night class for each course. The hardest part is you rarely get to choose your professor, it\u2019s whoever is teaching the offering. That being said, I\u2019ve been pretty pleased with most of my professors (especially the accting professors, shout out to Gaynor and Lee). If you are trying to take a class every night, that might be a problem too if the one night offering is on the same single night offering of another course. \n2. I work at a bank and it\u2019s honestly great. No late night shifts, minimal weekend hours (my role doesn\u2019t have weekend shifts) and I can apply my degree on the job real time. Also most banks will have an education reimbursement policy for business degrees after working there for around a year. If your goal is to work within the banking industry with the finance degree (such as a loan officer eventually) it would be good experience. \n\nI have no idea how to be social - I\u2019m not \ud83e\udd72 I just make friends in my classes",

There were plenty of students that were older than me, so don't worry about that. You might have to be flexible with your schedule as I was looking to take classes after work but it wasn't always possible. I took classes on my lunch break one semester. I also took classes during winter and summer sessions, and some classes I was able to take online at a community college. I did not have time to join any clubs, you may want to do that if you can.

Online/Night Classes are doable and depends on your major requirements, so talk to your advisor and learn how to navigate your AR. I preferably took some night classes because of work and some upper divisions were offered in the late evenings. \n2. As for jobs on campus, I would suggest looking into orgs that offer mentorship for other students or internships. I didn\u2019t really get involved because the pay was less than my current job. \n3. General advice: find the balance, give yourself some mental breaks, network, network, network! You only get of the experience, by what you make out of it. Use your resources on campus. \n\nFeel free to hmu with a chat, I\u2019m not a business major, but hopefully I can serve of some help.",

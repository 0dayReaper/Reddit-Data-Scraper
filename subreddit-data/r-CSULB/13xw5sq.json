            "comment": "A few years back I was a student researcher in the biology department, and had access to a lab in the Hall of Science (HSCI) basically all hours since I had keys to both the lab and the building itself. \n\nDuring finals week, I decided to stick around for an all-nighter in my lab to finish a paper and study for some exams. Those of you who are familiar with HSCI know it has a pretty complicated HVAC system to control all the fume hoods and various other safety infrastructure. \n\nAround 1:30am, while sitting along the back lab bench, the lights went out. It was very dark. I kind of sat there frozen for a few seconds, thinking maybe I'd have to go home if the power didn't come back on. \n\nAll of a sudden, I heard faint clicking noises coming from the hallway, getting closer and louder. This happened really fast, in the span of maybe 1-2 seconds the clicks went from quiet and distant to right outside the door. Then, the door to my lab kind-of slammed shut. The clicking continued down the hallway past my door, and I realized the clicks were other doors slamming shut. This whole thing took place in less than five seconds, before everything went silent again.\n\nA few moments later a blaring alarm went off on the fume hood in the corner, and a light flashed eerily bathing the lab in red. This is now ~20 seconds since the lights turned off, and I decided to get up and look at the fume hood.\n\nI stood up and used my phone flashlight to walk over, but as soon as I made it a few steps from my chair the lights turned back on. The alarm was still blaring, but at least I could see. I decided I shouldn't stick around any longer, and called it a night. I left the lab with the alarm still sounding, and walked down the hallway. Emminating from every other lab door was the same fume hood alarm. I decided all-nighters weren't for me.\n\n----\n\nSo to disappoint many of you, this wasn't a paranormal event haha. This happened early in my research career and I now have a rather satisfying explanation.\n\n(1) The lights:\nAll lights in HSCI research labs are motion activated. I had been sitting in a spot that was visible to the motion detector by the door, but for the last half hour I apparently didn't move much. The lights turned back on when the motion of me getting up was detected. I guess I must have been moving around at least enough to trigger the detector every 30 min before that point.\n\n(2) The doors:\nThis happened a few more times before I graduated, and my best understanding is the HVAC system must do some sort of change in its cycle that causes the pressure in the labs to become negative compared to the hallway. When that pressure is established, all the doors are pressed against the opposite part of the door frame, making a loud click sound. This happens in sequence down the hall.\n(if you understand HVAC and have anything to add I'd love to hear a better explanation!)\n\n(3) The fume hood:\nDirectly tied to the above explanation, if a sub-optimal flow of air is detected in a fume hood, it will set off a \"flow alarm\". Many mornings following that night I would come into the lab with the hood screaming at me. My PI told me to just hit the mute button and it wasn't a big deal haha. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the lights going off seconds before HVAC shinanagins was just a wonderfully creepy coincidence.",

            "comment": "Depends creepy like paranormal?  Or crazy student story?\n\nI attended CSULB for about 7 years... plenty of weird or crazy student stories! Though sadly none of mine dealt with ghosts.  Personally I think they qualify as creepy,  maybe creepier than if I had seen a ghost.... in at least one instance I'd rather see a ghost!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Lady in the elevator (someone mentioned this).  I had gone in the elevator a couple days before this accident happened.  The elevator creaked a LOT and didn't stop quite where it should (it was misaligned by maybe half an inch).  It was weird enough for me to look at the service date thing inside the elevator but it didn't say it was out of service.  When she passed away I was on campus and our president then (who of course is similar to the one today) didn't tell us exactly what happened for a while.  I was working there as a student worker so we were like WTH are these notifications?! WTH happened over there.  It was kinda not too shocking something was off with that elevator.  However; it would never cross my mind to attempt to get out.  The lady ended up squished to death because she tried to get out between floors and it dropped... (elevators have breaks at the bottom folks do not attempt to get out until a fireman has secured the elevator with clamps!)\n* Campus rapist spotted by my boss.  One of my on campus bosses spotted the campus rapist/sex assault dude in bathroom near business building.  She'd park nearby and was leaving work later in the evening when she saw him in the women's restroom.  She isn't a college age girl so she screamed at him \"what the hell are you doing in hear you freak!\" and he ran off immediately.  Later when he was arrested she was called in to identify him at the police office.\n* Mentally unwell student who threatened class on a study abroad trip- this one was told to me by a close friend who was in the same program as me.  I was not on the trip-- however---&gt; he warned me \"if you see a dude who matches this description just run if you hear gunshots.\"  For months this same dude was harassing people in classes, saying really weird batshit stuff, and being disruptive.  The staff in the program did absolutely nothing.  ZERO.  Zilch.. NADA.   The same student (we'll call him T) decides to go on a study abroad trip.  They go on this trip and somehow within the first two days T manages to acquire a weapon threaten students (several of them) and it was so bad the teacher barricaded herself into a dorm room with the students for several hours while lunatic was harassing them saying he was going to kill certain students.  Never mind the fact that he threatened people.  The guy was expelled from the study abroad trip and sent home, however he still was able to attend CSULB when fall started up.\n* Sexual stalkers - when I attended we had three that I can remember.  There was the up-skirt dude who would take photos of girls in skirts as they were in the restroom or walking by (eww).  The rapist (mentioned above) also the reason we started having \"escorts\" at night on campus.  AND lastly the sexual harasser who was female.  The female one honestly I think was the most creepy.  They were a foreigner and basically acted like a male stalker.  Even after several student complaints this person was not expelled nor disciplined.  They also did the whole \"photo\" the object of desire thing but upped it to a whole other level --- they even asked other students for the person's photos (if they could get it), how to photoshop clothing off (what a joke!), telling people they wanted other people's \"innocence\" and oh wait it gets better--&gt; another student worked on their laptop who was tech savvy since it was having problems...in their computer were 8,000+ photos (in various angles) of the individuals on campus this person was stalking.  Others said they same them looking at porn on campus computers.  NOW if it were a man this person could be given a misdemeanor for sexual harassment (creating a hostile workplace/persistent leering) and at a minimum lose their on-campus job and be sent home.  I'm sorry its fked up. But because it was a woman and culture, NOTHING was said or done, as it if it didn't exist, didn't happen, etc.  The only time they got a real rebuke from a professor was for taking an ass-shot of said female professor on campus (they published it online).   The grossest part?  She worked with kids outside of csu. (BARF).   I'm not making this up. It was predatory behavior, plain and simple.  I still I feel a little sick thinking about how this person was not sent home despite several of us complaining.\n* Hate crime- there was a incident of at least one trans person being harassed and beat up on campus (so loving long beach =p!)\n* The Flasher- we did have a flasher there when I was going.  He'd come up to girls and well...flash them.  I don't think this guy ever got caught.\n* Smack that b\\*tch up- we had one (seemingly homeless) dude smack a girl riding her bike off her bike outside of Brotman hall.  I was by the fountain when this happened at round 8:30 in the morning one day.  The guy looked a bit out of it and he got really close to where the bike lane would be and as this girl was non-chalantly riding her cruiser bicycle he smacked her as hard as he could and she went flying off the bike along with her books and was on the ground crying.   The police did apprehend him about 12 minutes later since everyone was like wtf and called the cops and he was still lurking about.",

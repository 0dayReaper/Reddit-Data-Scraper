    "postText": "Hi everyone. I was offered work study and I'm trying to find a job on campus. After reading a couple of posts here, it looks like careerlink is the place to go to. On csulb it says i can access career link after logging into SSO, which I did but I cannot find careerlink anywhere on the page. I also went to the work study page on csulb and it sent me to Okta, which its asking me to sign in, no where is there a link to sign up. I tried signing in with a portion of my student email as it said in the instruction but nothingggg\nI'm just so confused and frustrated\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29",

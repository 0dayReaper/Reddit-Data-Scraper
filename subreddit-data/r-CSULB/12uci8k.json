    "postText": "I enjoy having fun with fun teams on projects. These last two years at my community college have been a blast with meeting so many people and joining in on their bands or productions. I would like to enjoy the next two years of meeting more people. \n\nI have the option of joining CSULB's Theory and Cinema Program. Now, I know some of what the word is about the program.  People say it's not hands-on, it's textbooks and essays. \n\nI am optimistic about still having a good time no matter where I go.  I just would like to hear as many thoughts and have a discussion with the students who are in that space. Possibly some hopeful words too!\n\nHere's a little about my character. I enjoy being around people. I enjoy making others feel listened to and helping them step back and enjoy the moment.  I enjoyed my time playing music with others and entertaining the elderly these past few years. I am just finishing up my associate's for transfer and will be attending a university in the fall. This spring semester, I just moved by myself three hours away from my home because my old community college didn't have a production course. I've met so many new faces and learned so much about the production elements of filmmaking. I really enjoyed meeting so many charming, clever, and creative people. I really would like to continue meeting people in fun environments, and also not lose all the stored information in my head about productions.\n\nThanks a ton, everyone.",

            "comment": "The film department is great! I am graduated but I did the documentary route and even though it\u2019s the smallest track in the FEA dept, I got so much hands on experience with equipment and got to try out different roles. I\u2019m not sure about the theory track but I did love all my requirement film theory/history courses. Lots of writing but you learn so much and get to watch cool movies. If I were you I\u2019d look into seeing if you actually get to make student films in that track since it sounds like that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in. Sorry I don\u2019t have more specific advice but biggest thing I\u2019d say is keep up the positive attitude especially when the workload is tough- it\u2019s worth it \u2764\ufe0f",

So thank you for that. I think the documentary route would be a nice one to follow! Your advice was great and I really appreciate it!  Very reassuring! Thanks for that! I hope you have a great weekend!",

            "comment": "I graduated last spring from the program and it was really fun! Unfortunately I only got to work on a few projects because covid happened right in the middle, but luckily my senior year I got to do a few. My biggest piece of advice would be just to talk to as many people as you can in your classes and let them know what positions you\u2019re interested in, that way when they have or hear of a project they can reach out to you. I would also recommend to try as many different positions on set as you can- even if you\u2019re not super keen on doing them because you gain a lot of experience and knowledge which can help you in the future and who knows you might end up loving something you didn\u2019t know before! Last thing, try to join clubs! There\u2019s producers club, doc club, and women in film which are all great. It seems like this year the department is doing a lot of events so attend as many as you can. Sorry for the lengthy response but hope it helps!",

            "comment": "it\u2019s so wonderful you write such warm words about filmmaking and team building. I also love those parts about life and the arts too. I\u2019m in the post-prod which is in the umbrella of theory. I\u2019ve had hands on classes which were editing (premiere) and sound design (protools). This sem I\u2019m taking more \u201ctextbook\u201d classes like art history and broadcast history.\n\nIt\u2019s a lil heady but I enjoy parts of it. \n\nAnyways I think whichever film school one decides on is good enough and I think it\u2019s up to the individual to join organizations , clubs, groups, build relationships, network , etc all that delicious stuff. To be more hands on. \n\nSo the spring is interesting bc that\u2019s when the \u201cnarrative\u201d track students create their short films in their production classes. So all of March/Apr/May (and school ends around mid-may) the students rotate on their classmates films. \n\nThey seek crew members and actors and editors. That\u2019s one great way to be more hands on. \n\nProducers club is great bc students pitch and wrangle crew for pre thru post. That has been extremely beneficial for me. \n\nWriters club (writers block) has round tables for storytellers. Women\u2019s in film (WIF) has interactive group activities. Like every group I\u2019ve joined or visited has been fun and welcoming. There\u2019s also guest speakers who are industry professionals who present and speak. It\u2019s so casual too. Jus today a production coordinator CSULB alumni spoke at producers clerbbbb. \n\nanddddd the school has the carpenter auditorium (idk name rn too lazy to look up) which hosts all kinds of events from music dance entertainment speakers. Jeanette mccurdy talked abt her book a few weeks back. \n\nI enjoy my time at csulb. My advisor and professors are awesome. Film Dept head Adam Moore is awesome. Genuine people who support students. \n\nAnd if you need addl help. Disability. Mental health. Time mgmt skills. Food insecurity. Housing insecurity. The school has dedicated depts with knowledgeable professionals staffed that help students\n\nBMAC disabilities Trio SSS first gen studen support CAPS mental health. Accommodations, advice, guidance, spaces for healing, it\u2019s all very helpful. \n\nI\u2019d also say try to walk around on campus and take a tour. Self guided or maybe they have a guided tour for the film Dept. I didn\u2019t take one but I just heard good things abt csulb for film and just went with it. It felt more appealing than other CSU\u2019s \n\nIf you catch a vibe I\u2019d say consider it further :) good luck",

I am happy you feel the same way!\n\nI am glad I got to hear from you with your direction in post-production. That's exciting to hear about other students' works and short films in the Spring. I'll be sure to stop by and see what I can help out with! Hopefully, I'll learn a thing or two! The clubs sound so exciting too! The idea of having a team and helping out with a project is making me pretty happy.\n\nWow, guest speakers! That's always cool! Jennette McCurdy! What! Ah She was my favorite in ICarly! ha\n\nYou're really giving me some comfort about my time there! I appreciate that a lot. Thanks for even talking about the resources for support and whatnot. That's real kind of you.\n\nI'll definitely explore the school and opportunities! I'll do my best to seek a good time!\n\nWow, guest speakers! That's always cool! Jennette McCurdy! What!

I wanted to go to the campus and housing tours but all of them are filled to capacity along with the individual family tours. i\u2019m also over 6+ hours away from the school and i\u2019m just asking is it even worth it to go anymore? or does anyone know what i should do or if there\u2019s anything i can do? thank you.",

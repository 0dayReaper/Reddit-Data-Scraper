    "postText": "hi guys. i\u2019m an incoming freshman at csulb and recently got the news that i was waitlisted for housing, being #312 on the waitlist\u2026\n\ni live about 23 miles from campus. some of my friends who live in the same area as me have been approved for housing, as well as people who live closer to long beach than i do, so i don\u2019t really understand the process\u2026i thought they prioritized by distance, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it. does anyone have idea why this is? \n\nalso\u2026what would be the chances of me getting off the waitlist? and if i don\u2019t, is commuting worth it? i feel like if i commute i won\u2019t be able to get the whole college experience, as well as having the burden of wasting gas driving 30+ minutes to school everyday and waking up early",

Since most students who do attend CSUs are commuter students. So the choice is yours but quality of education should be the foremost of concerns.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think they prioritize distance since 30 minutes isn\u2019t that bad compared to international students who are like 5000 miles out or students from out of state. So chances seem slim.",

I would just make sure you get some snacks, or food in between, rest, hang out in LB on your free time, just enjoy LB as much as you can! It also could help to have friends that live nearby.",

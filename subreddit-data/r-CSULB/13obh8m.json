    "postText": "Do you guys think HRM360 and IS301 is doable to do at the same time during the 1st half of summer? The other class I wanted to take is closed during the other 2nd half of the summer. So my only choice is to take HRM360 and IS301 at the same time.\n\nI'm not sure if the other class will open up. So I kind a don't want to take my chances in waiting. If I do wait, and the class is still closed then I can't take it.  I am planning to take Lori Brown and Josh Arnold. Thanks for reading!",

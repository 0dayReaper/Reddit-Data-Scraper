For those of you who *have* done the program...\n\n(1) What was your unique experience(s) of conducting research and working with faculty?\n\n(2) Were there any challenges that cropped up during any time throughout the duration of the program?\n\n(3) Finally, what tips of advice do you have?\n\nThank you so much! I greatly appreciate any and all the assistance! :D",

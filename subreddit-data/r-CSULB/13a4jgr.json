    "postText": "I had Jean Lee-Lim for 220A and loved her, but unfortunately can\u2019t take her lab for 223B. I am currently enrolled in Justin Lim\u2019s lab section, however I noticed another professor that would fit in my schedule, Thach Ho. Both of their RMP reviews are horrible. Justin Lim\u2019s is 3.3/5 for overall, and 4 for level of difficulty. Thach Ho\u2019s is 3.7/5 overall and 3 for difficulty. I was wondering if anyone has taken either of their classes and could steer me in the right direction!",

            "comment": "While I haven\u2019t taken those classes, I did take 227 with Thatch Ho (lecture only) and can say that he is a very kind dude but his accent makes it very hard to understand. His grading scale was generous though, as it was 60% (or 65%?) for a C. Though, if you\u2019re taking him for a lab i\u2019m not sure if he does that. He does go on a lot of tangents. His tests and quizzes weren\u2019t super hard and a few of the exams the study guide was the exact same as the exam lol",

He was probably one of my favorite professors personality-wise. (don\u2019t let your boyfriend go to san francisco with you best friend!)",

On occasion he'll go around checking how you're doing your experiment and help you out if youre running into trouble. Very sweet lab grandpa lmao. I dunno about Justin Lim as a lab instructor but I had him as an ochem professor and it was not the best experience..",

My friend had lim and they said that he is very on the book so for experiments it would be hard to finish within the three hours.",

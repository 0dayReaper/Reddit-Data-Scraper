I\u2019ve been lurking around and I haven\u2019t seen/heard much on transferring from a cc. I would have an AAT for Studio Arts and my GEs completed &amp; my gpa so far is a 4.0. However, I\u2019m still currently working on my portfolio! I was wondering if anyone had any examples of their portfolio that helped them get into the program! I was also wondering the difference between the the animation/illustration track and the pre-production track. I really just want to do visual development stuff:\u2019) Thank you :D",

            "comment": "Hi! Transferred in Spring 2023 with an AA-T in Studio Art! An alumni from my CC told me that was the best way to get into CSULB, and then once you've had a semester of classes there, you're established and have access to workshops, peers, alumni, and professors, including the judges for the BFAs, to look over your portfolio and offer feedback. I'm applying to the Animation BFA next semester.\n\nSo Animation, while technically under Illustration, is like its own thing. Own requirements and such. That is straight up animation, and while there are other classes you can take I believe it focuses mainly on animation itself. Illustration is illustrations. Pre-production is kind of a crossroad of the two, the animation stuff before the animation, which is a lot of illustrating. If you're wanting to do VisDev, Pre-Production sounds like the place for you!\n\nOfc take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, I'm not a super experienced alumni or anything. There is a CSULB School of Art discord server, and there's old portfolios and portfolio workshops floating around in there. Good luck!",

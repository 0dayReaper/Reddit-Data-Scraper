    "postText": "Hey y'all!. I would like to transfer Spring 2024 to CSULB, but my GPA is pretty low. I know I can bump it up maybe to a 2.75 GPA in the summer, but that's as far as it could probably take me.\n\nI have enough classes to graduate at my CC with an Associates Degree, which is a guarantee into the CSU system, but not a specific campus. What was y'alls experiences with that guaranteed transfer? Did you get accepted into the school you originally wanted?\n\nMy other choices are CSULA, CSU East Bay, Cal Poly Pomona, and CSUF!",

Give it a shot if you can.\n\nInitially went to CSULA and I'll just say CSULB is leagues better in terms of amenities. CSU east Bay cost of living I'm sure is f'ing outrageous relative to all the other csu's on your list.\n\nCal poly Pomona is a beautiful school, I'd say even more so than CSULB.my ex went there and I enjoyed being on campus. Parking is atrocious, but I'm sure that goes for all the schools. \n\nYou should visit these campuses and see what vibe you get. You're going to end up spending 2+ yrs at one of these locations, so visiting is a good investment",

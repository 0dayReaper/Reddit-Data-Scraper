Why bother going inside the stadium for a 1 second jumbotron view and hearing all the speeches of the university president and other administrators? They're just there to praise themselves and give meaningless motivational speeches.\n\nI haven't been up to date with the Let 23 Walk movement, so I don't know what students are planning to do that day.",

They photographed and called names prior to the graduation on a small stage so that they could sell those photographs and that we could videotape it. There were thousands of people graduating, maybe 3000, so calling names would\u2019ve been painfully long. It was really nice anyway. It was in the evening so we weren\u2019t sitting in the sun. We could move to a seat/location of our choosing to avoid the sun if needed/desired.",

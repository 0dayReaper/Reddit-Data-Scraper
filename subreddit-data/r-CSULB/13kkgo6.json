    "postText": " \n\nHey everyone, student workers at CSULB and all 23 CSUs are forming a union right now for better pay, benefits, and working conditions. Any of you guys who work on campus know that student workers are critical to keeping the university operational but are paid poverty wages with no sick time or parking benefits, and we're capped at 20 hours/week.\n\nMore than 4,000 of us from across the state filed for a union election with the labor board last month making it the biggest non-academic student workers union campaign in national history. The CSU is trying to delay our union election so we're getting every student worker signed up on union cards to show support.\n\nIf you haven't already, join the movement and [sign your union card here](https://www.studentassistantunion.org/Reddit)!",

CSUs (and also most positions at UCs that are admin and not \"manager\" titles) pay crap.\n\nI was a student worker; I didn't expect it to be a regular job.  Good luck with your fight but just know a lot of the regular workers are also screwed over big time.  What will happen is tuition will go up to cover your extras...\n\nI think if you want real meaningful change it would need to include the regular workers too.  Most of them are \"temporary\" with limited term appts for 1-2 years then they can get canned at the discretion of their managers, and they have degrees and are treated like dirt.",

I didn't take any workshops and came in as a straight transfer but I got a score that required me to take 1 writing class which i think it was a Media Studies class for the Film degree (don't take it with Prof Larry Smith, tough exams). My score was like 1 point from being a \"No writing class required\" but it wasn't all that hard. Don't get me wrong i didn't think i was going to do well to be honest, but i still didn't do any workshops since i was too socially anxious to talk to anyone lol.\n\nUltimately it is depending on how confident you feel you are with your argumentative writing skills. If you tend to get high grades without additional help, then you'll be fine but if you seem to struggle then go for the workshops since it couldn't hurt. \n\nIt is a PDF link so it will prompt to download or open with Google drive. \n\n\n[California State University, Bakersfield\nhttps://www.csub.edu \u203a _filesPDF\nWriting Assessment Requirements (GWAR) Revised Spring 2018](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.csub.edu/testing/_files/GWAR%2520PolicyrevSpring2018.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjo-O7A3-3-AhUhE1kFHcdWCHEQFnoECBoQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kQ1820LKmVEg-duIzzC7m)",

It\u2019s fairly easy, it\u2019s timed and they give you enough information to make a response. If you\u2019re horrible at writing essays, or have a rough barrier due to language differences, then go to workshops to prepare. If you\u2019re able to do essays without major problems, than you\u2019ll most likely do fine. If you pass, you\u2019ll have to take a writing intensive course, which is usually the last English class of your major, so you don\u2019t have to take an extra unnecessary class (unless you need too, my major had an intensive class in its capstone class (the last English/lit class), I assume it\u2019s the same for all majors). If you fail the test, youll have to take an extra approved writing/English class, as well as an intensive writing course, they\u2019ll email you information on what classes are approved. The test has a fee, a non refundable one. According to the emails, if you don\u2019t sign up for the GWAR soon, you\u2019ll be put on hold from registering to classes, however, I\u2019ve neglected the exam for two semesters and never had a hold, not sure if It was just bugged or not. Just take it when you can, it\u2019s always best to get it out of the way. Best of luck !",

    "postText": "I have thought about this for a while now, but after what our school has done to us by not giving us a proper graduation ceremony, I no longer feel proud of graduating from CSULB next week and it's truly heartbreaking. I am definitely proud to be graduating college because it obviously took a lot of hard work and sacrifice, but just not happy with this school. Does anyone share similar thoughts?",

            "comment": "Damn, a lot of these comments are coming from a place of privilege. Sure, you can have your viewpoint and not care about walking or not. That\u2019s fair.\n\nBut to give the opposite viewpoint on the issue. A lot of the people pissed and upset about not getting their names called it comes from a legitimate place. The people upset that their names aren\u2019t getting and getting to walk put a lot on the line. Whether it be having their family support them financially, emotionally, logistically etc. it is a valid reason to be upset and feel what they feel. \n\nIs that to say that there aren\u2019t people whose family supported them in that way and don\u2019t care about them walking or the individual doesn\u2019t care? Nope, but my response isn\u2019t for them.\n\n\u201cThe real world doesn\u2019t care about your feelings\u201d okay? Does that mean that you\u2019re never allowed to feel upset about something bc the real world doesn\u2019t care about what you feel and life keeps moving? No. \n\nA lot of the people here are first generation students who worked hard not only for their degree but also had to navigate a complex system. They deserve to hear their name.\n\nLastly, although I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019d let the fact my name isn\u2019t being called ruin my 2 years here entirely. I did make amazing memories and friends. But I do let it piss me off bc of the bullshit reasons given by Conoley stating that [she\u2019d be tired by the end of the 12 ceremonies needed to accommodate calling people\u2019s names](https://youtu.be/KCfzvjFYdXY) . She can stay her lazy ass home. She makes more than the US president and has her own manor. If every Cal state can call their students names so can Long Beach. But whatevers",

But I\u2019d imagine most, if not all, of my graduating class that stayed in CE should have gotten their EIT, and I have a handful of friends (the ones I did stay in touch with) working on their PE right now (graduated in 2017). Even for complete fools, I\u2019d imagine passing the PE is a numbers game. If you just take it enough times you\u2019ll eventually get lucky and study the right things that end up on the exam.\n\nI do hope you\u2019re correct tho. Maybe, by some divine alignment of events, their careers have been mildly inconvenienced by their college choices and my bitterness would be healed knowing justice was served lol.",

            "comment": "I skipped my graduation walk by choice. I proud of it. I did it because I have more important things to do as a graduate! Throw your own party and be happy you\u2019re officially done.   \n\n\nI agree with everyone else here. You might be focusing on the wrong thing here, venting about not the ceremony not meeting your expectations makes it seem like you\u2019re not mindful of the whole situation\u2026like, ie: graduating and being done with school.   \n\n\nSaying you\u2019re not proud to go here because you\u2019re resentful about not getting a graduation sounds like entitlement, as if you think you deserve a certain thing. Nothing is guaranteed in life. Try to find the good in the situation instead of focusing on what you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t getting. Start planning your post-graduation life.",

Part of it is my fault also for still deciding to going here knowing it was a commuter school. I just wanted that campus life energy but couldn\u2019t afford to go to a UC. The students at my CC were also way more friendly and willing to make friends.\n\nI hope my last semester this Fall will make up for it (I made a big personal change that will either make it the same as previous semesters or 100x better).\n\nOn a good note, I\u2019m doing the cultural graduation on Saturday to walk early and I\u2019m pretty excited for the experience of walking and being recognized for my accomplishments!",

    "postText": "I'm on the Graphic Design track and an advisor gave me a handout of each semester down the road for me. Some of the semesters on the handout DO include courses like \"Art 101 Artists in Their Own Words (GE/E)\" or \"Art 121 Safety &amp; Sustainability for Studio Artists (GE/E)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anybody know if these courses are required to progress? OR are they just courses that satisfy their respective letter requirement and simply happen to be art classes? I have already taken an E cat. GE among others. Thanks!",

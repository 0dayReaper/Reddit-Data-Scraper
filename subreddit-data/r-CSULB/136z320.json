    "postText": "Hello, I will be starting the nursing program at CSULB in the fall. I was wondering if any current students have any good tips as far as spending money. It seems like there's a big chunk to doll out before school even starts. I was wondering if you guys can help guide me on ways I can save money, be it on books or anything else. I'd really appreciate it!",

I would get the Davis Drug Guide instead. It is far superior. Spend the money that you would\u2019ve spent on those text books practicing self-care.",

PM me if you have any other questions about the program, i\u2019d be happy to help!!",

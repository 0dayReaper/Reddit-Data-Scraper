Who had to work extra this year to hold special ceremonies on campus in a number of departments because some of the schools actually care about their graduates? Faculty and Staff (though mostly staff). I've been here 16 years and seen 2 salary increases that weren't COLA. I cannot tell you how over it a number of staff are about Miss Jane's actions and benefits and total tone deaf responses she has. Really hoping the Board of Trustees sees her as a problem and ousts her. until then.... collective #SIGH and keep calling her out to the public!",

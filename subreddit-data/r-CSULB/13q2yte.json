It is actually really nice not having to bring work home or studying for the next test. With that being said I still live with my parents and don't have too many bills to pay so I'd say I'm not 100% adulting yet.",

But you find balance and learn some tools to make it easier. With technology (alarms, reminders, autopay, calendars, apps, electronic communications, transportation options, etc), adulting is easier than ever but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s easy. You make a lot of sacrifices and fall on your face a bunch, but the pay-offs are foundational and liberating.\n\nHappy to be the [wrath aunt](https://imgur.com/a/vIDa5Jh) if you have more questions.",

I\u2019m only now getting to the point where I can kinda see where I\u2019ll be in five years, but even still I know there\u2019s probably something unanticipated waiting for me around the corner. The life I\u2019ve lead was simply unimaginable 10-15 years ago and I feel like this is true for a lot of my peers. Life takes a lot of meandering twists, a lot of them entirely unexpected. \n\nDon\u2019t lose sight of right now. You don\u2019t have to know \u201cwhat you wanna be when you grow up\u201d because that may change time and time again, and the possibilities are endless; it\u2019s just a matter of where you find yourself. You haven\u2019t been exposed to much yet, but the opportunities will present themselves. Have faith in yourself that you\u2019ll figure it out, bc you will. With a degree, you\u2019re certainly channeled in a particular general direction but that does not mean that you\u2019re forever constrained, if at all to begin with. \n\nThink about your needs and desires and find something suitable to those ends. Forget about your career trajectory; what kind of life do you want to lead? What kind of person do you want to be? What purpose do you want to serve to your community? What do you need to do to meet those ends? You don\u2019t have to have all the answers \u2014 they\u2019ll come in time and experience \u2014 but those are the kind of marbles you should be kicking around. It\u2019s ok if all you know about your future is that you want to be healthy, loved, and financially stable. Find something that works for you now and meets those needs. \n\nReal talk tho, credit and retirement is *real* in our capitalistic world. Do your best to tend to those in whatever jobs you do land. There are more well versed financial experts to set you up there. I recommend airline credit cards tho! \n\nSorry it\u2019s a novel; I\u2019m verbose when I\u2019m stoned \ud83d\ude06",

You will never have things figured out entirely, but you should at least have some thought about how you want your life to pan out. \n\nI just want to echo this again. Credit and retirement are real things you should ALWAYS tend to once you're in the real world. Don't skimp on those, or you will be far behind later on in life.",

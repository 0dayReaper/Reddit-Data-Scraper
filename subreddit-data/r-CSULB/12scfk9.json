    "postText": "Someone linked the below video in a discord I'm part of, basically a Daily Forty-Niner post talking about the various aspects of the commencement controversy. \n\nSuper interesting is getting to hear interview snippets from Jane Close Conoley, wherein she essentially states how tiring it would be for her to go to more than 9 ceremonies since she goes to each one, and cites her inconvenience as valid reasoning. Apparently for half a mill, its too inconvenient to actually think about the people graduating.\n\nMa'am, if its too hard for you to go to 12 ceremonies so much that you're affecting the lives and all that 15,000 graduates have worked for, it's time to retire. Thanks for proving you care more about yourself than the student body. If it's that hard, don't go. No one's going for you.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCfzvjFYdXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCfzvjFYdXY)",

If you can't make all of them then don't. \n\nI understand it's a bad look for the president to not go to graduation ceremonies, especially if she goes to some and not others. But I'm sure the students do not give a flying fuck\n\nEdit: just wanted to give a shout out to the editing and voice over work in this video. Great stuff.",

Latest data is 2020 with $350 base salary but after bonuses and the like, she genuinely made over $500k. Also her housing is provided, and she has a really nice house.\n\nAlso worth noting I\u2019ve seen reports that this number had since gone up. This is just the figure found since she\u2019s a government employee so her salary is public.",

Since the graduation fee is $100, that should be $1.5 million to cover commencement. As the Angel Stadium ceremonies are only costing the school just a bit south of $1 million, where's the extra $500k in graduation fees going if it's not being used to provide students with an adequate graduation ceremony?",

[You can see it here.](https://twitter.com/lukewines/status/1648832904242556928?s=46&amp;t=Lx8rJSvblfwdTbIqjno9OA)\n\nThe TLDR of it is that the graduation fee pays for the paperwork end of things also. This includes the cost of shipping diplomas and degree auditing. \n\nYou can see a link to the 2019 cost breakdown in the video description that the Daily 49er obtained by public information request.",

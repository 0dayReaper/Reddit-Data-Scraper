Other people believe there was a to prove the officer who he was. Both individuals failed to do that. I was even thinking they could look at the staff directory or if he\u2019s a prominent professor, maybe there is an news article they can pull up. \n\nNothing wrong happened here other than an individual who seeks out racism found racism. \n\nIn my opinion that professor is the racist for assuming the cops were racist biased of the color of their skin.",

Every human being is a victim in various ways.  Full stop. All of us. It becomes problematic when people like the professor in the OP video use it as a crutch or an excuse for all of the problems they encounter in their life. In many cases, as with this one, its simply not applicable and actually holds people back by providing an eternal excuse and robbing one of the opportunity to learn from their own mistakes.\n\nOne way to look at this situation is to conclude that this cop must be a racist.  There is no objective evidence to support this claim as far as I can see.  Another way to look at it is to acknowledge ones own failure of personal responsibility (lost both IDs, willingly chose to drive without license, chose not to contact the dean or call campus security to address this directly instead of just showing up and whining that someone simply doing their job gets in the way).\n\nI don't think you are an idiot, by the way.",

The part you are leaving out, however, is victimhood in this case, it\u2019s not as simple as someone being told they\u2019re stupid. This is a systemic issue. So it is not as simple as just deciding not to be a victim of race anymore. And this system is a construct built upon this notion. you may or may not except it, but it is likely that this cop may be inherently racist without even knowing or understanding why he is. There is very room for valid conversation around the idea that a Caucasian person might have been given more consideration. Or, let\u2019s say the cop may have been less bound by the letter of the law, choosing instead to adopt spirit of the law. It is small nuances such as this that mini fail to consider when talking about inherent systemic racism. For what it\u2019s worth, I apologize and retract my previous statement calling you an idiot.",

It's such a large commuter campus with all the parking lots way away from most of the class buildings. Are there figures of how many people utilize these programs every year?\n\nAgain, I haven't been to campus in over a decade, but from what I remember, campus police was really helpful.",

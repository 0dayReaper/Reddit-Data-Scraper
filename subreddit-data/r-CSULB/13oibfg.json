I\u2019m contracted to work 2 more days after class begins on Aug 22nd.\n\ni\u2019m torn on whether to negotiate an earlier return with my research mentor, or negotiate with my professors individually on attending class via zoom those days (or just asking them to excuse my absence). \n\nIs this something I should contact my major department about?",

There\u2019s a lot to get done and missing even a week would make it harder to get my paper done. So far I\u2019ve emailed my professors and one has replied to let me know it\u2019s fine.",

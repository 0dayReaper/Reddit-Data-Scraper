    "postText": "I applied to CSULB\u2019s nursing program for Fall 2023. I got my conditional admission and I turned in my transcripts before the deadline. I got an email from the SON saying I was accepted, however, I have to wait until the university itself accepts me. Well I got an email today saying my admission offer was rescinded. I thought I was going to die as soon as I saw the email. Anyway, the email stated they were unable to confirm what I reported in the Supplemental Application for Transfer. It also said that I could go on CSULB\u2019s website to see the specific reason my admission was withdrawn. I was already thinking that I messed up on the Supplemental Application BUT the reason they rescinded my offer was because I did not meet a major specific requirement, which was Chemistry. I didn\u2019t even know what to think at this point because I literally took Chemistry and my grade shows up on the transcript. I went to go see what I put on the supplemental application and everything aligned with my transcripts. Is the university really withdrawing my admission because I \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d take Chemistry when it says on my transcripts that I CLEARLY did?! Did the university make a mistake? Has something like this happened to others before? But yeah I have no idea what\u2019s going on. I still feel like I\u2019m dreaming and this isn\u2019t real lol.",

I saw the mistake and knew that was gonna happen so I filed a couple tickets ahead of time and heard nothing back ever. Finally I went to the enrollment services window and was connected with someone over the phone who admitted me right then and there. They have some sloppy data entry practices it seems and it\u2019s wildly stressful to deal with. It\u2019s only my future we\u2019re fucking with here.",

    "postText": "Okay, this is my fault for thinking the campus wouldn't be predatory. But because I work on campus and my check doesn't come for a few days. I decided to park in the lot that I usually use hoping there would be a grace period. I was dead wrong, I saw multiple cars with tickets. Probably poor unsuspecting students who didn't realize their passes expired. I sent an appeal and thought the 1200 characters were words and wrote a detailed letter, but I had to shorten it.\n\nGuys, can we please protest the parking fees by not paying the fees and parking on campus anyway? Im sick of this stuff, and this campus can be so anti-student. Like I WORK for the campus, how are you going to steal my money back from me?",

Full time employee even have to pay for a permit during the summer where the lots are empty most days. But why?",

My offer nearly was rescinded because a CSULB employee looked at my Joint Services Transcript, but didn\u2019t bother to actually update that they were received in the system. If I hadn\u2019t been able to view on the JST website exactly which CSULB employee looked at my these records and then called said employee out in an email, I could very well have had my admission rescinded.  Fortunately, CSULB is kind enough to publish their employees emails online. It isn\u2019t always the students fault.  Sometimes it is an employees lack of attention to detail. I learned very early on during the transfer process to hand carry whatever records I could to CSULB. Unfortunately that\u2019s not possible with JST records.",

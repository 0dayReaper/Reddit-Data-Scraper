    "postText": "How late can professors be to a class before students are allowed to leave without their grade suffering.\n\nI had a professor that was 55 minutes late and after leaving after 45 minutes (and seeing them in the parking lot) of their absence I\u2019m seeing that my grade has been marked down.  \n\nObviously I feel this is unfair and in my prior college experience it\u2019s something like 15-20 minutes of no professor, you can leave. \n\nIf anyone can clarify this with me or send me a link to policy and procedure that either approves or disproves this I would really appreciate it. I\u2019ve looked online with no luck. \n\nThank you!!",

I hope it wasn\u2019t your final exam period.\n\nAs far as I know, it\u2019s 15 minutes unless the instructor has contacted the students to notify them of the delay and asks them to wait longer. If the prof emailed you but you didn\u2019t check your email or Canvas before leaving, they can hold you accountable for an absence and any work you missed.\n\nI think what you\u2019re looking for is in the college catalog, but I can\u2019t find the policy with an easy google search. I\u2019ve been around a long time, like 20 years, as a student and an instructor, and as far as I know, this has always been the policy.",

Zipcar is expensive and a hassle because there were only two at the time for use.  SoCal is inherently dependent on you having a car to do anything. As someone not from SoCal, once I wrapped my head around this concept, it made me realize how much I was missing out on. You could easily expound upon this topic to other areas such as infrastructure, but this email is certainly lacking in practicality and the reality of the situation.",

I've also seen plenty of people nap at the library or in the booth seats at the Horn Center, but they're typically full so ya gotta be quick if you see one cleared out. Booths are great cuz you can also charge your stuff too. Theres also a really nice study room on the first floor of USU near the elevators. I dont recall booths, but there were soft seats I laid back in to take naps. If you're concerned about ppl touching your stuff, some buildings have lockers you can rent out",

If you are willing to take a hike, the most peaceful place on campus is probably the empty field near Pugunga and the Japanese garden. There's also a nice grassy hillside beside Brotman hall for a more central location. If all else fails, find a nice tree in the quad to huddle under :) as for indoor locations, I'm not quite sure, though the basement of the student success center is usually pretty quiet",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a prospective transfer student wrapping up my associate degree in computer science and considering between CSULB and CSUF for my bachelor's. I'd love to hear from current students and alumni about your experiences in the CS program.\n\nHere are some key points I'm curious about:\n\n1. How do you feel about the quality of the curriculum? Are there any interesting specializations or electives that you've enjoyed or found valuable?\n\n2. What's the faculty like? Are they accessible and supportive? Any standout professors or classes you'd recommend?\n\n3. How are the campus resources for CS students, like computer labs, libraries, and career services? Have they been helpful for your academic journey?\n\n4. Internships and job placement opportunities \u2013 what's been your experience with finding internships or job offers through the program? Any tips or success stories?\n\n5. Lastly, what's the overall vibe of the computer science community at CSULB? Are there any clubs or organizations you'd recommend joining?\n\nThank you so much for helping me.",

            "comment": "1 - The quality of curriculum has been absolute dogshit. I find it to be uninspiring and a lot of it very irrelevant. Upper division classes are even worse. For example, CECS 341 is just a class that should be scrapped and CECS 342 is somewhat repetitive and had me programming in Prolog which is an irrelevant programming language. You don't learn what the industry actually wants from you. In all fairness, computer science programs in general are terrible. I hear nothing but complaints from people regardless of the college they go to. For CSULB, it is worse though. This is largely due to what I will explain in 2.\n\n2 - The faculty is horrible. It is getting worse and worse every year. Professors are leaving and CSULB can't find anybody to hire. This is due to the fact that CSULB is a public college. Somebody with a computer science degree will make the most money working at industry or a private university. This leaves CSULB with unqualified people teaching classes. The professors are there to do research, they are not actually there to teach. That is just part of their contract. They don't have actual credentials to teach generally speaking. The professors are trained to be \"experts\" in their field, not to actually teach. This ends up in professors being largely unhelpful and having terrible lectures that are not very understandable. This problem gets worse when a lot of professors have thick accents and I genuinely don't understand what they are saying. It makes going to any lecture entirely pointless. Because of the professor shortage, you get professors end up teaching classes when they quite literally have no experience in the subject they are supposed to be teaching. I have one class where the professor does not know the programming language the assignments are done in. It is actually outrageous. In short, the faculty is not really accessible or supportive to me at all. That being said, there are good professors (just not many). Gold, Terrell, Jurgensen, Fahim, Sayadi, Cappel, and Murgolo are the good professors from my personal experience + what others have said. Everybody else has been meh or really bad for me.\n\n3 and 4 do not apply that much to be so I will leave somebody else to give an answer to that.\n\n5 - If I had to say what the CS vibe is, it is not really some great one due to the quality of the CS program. The students tend to complain in the discord servers pertaining to our classes. There is definitely a lot of stress and irritation towards the department and the professors. The organization I would recommend to join is the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). You can head to their discord server for more information - [https://discord.gg/csulbacm](https://discord.gg/csulbacm).",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t doubt that the quality of the education, the available internship and tutoring resources are not at least of passable quality. They have to have those stats they tout about somehow.\n\nBUT THERE ARE SOME MAJOR PROBLEMS\n\nThe department feels like it\u2019s held together by wet tissue paper on fire. They can\u2019t seem to hire enough people, or simply aren\u2019t willing to . This leads to\u2026\n1) classes can be massive. What feels like least four classes I have had so far in my four semesters have had upwards of 60+ people. Which makes participation difficult.\n2) if not the above, classes waitlisted to shit. They have this \u201crecommended courses to take per semester graphic\u201d that tells you what classes to take during which semesters to simplify things and ensure you can graduate. Which would be great if you could actually sign up for said classes. I\u2019ve been waitlisted twice for major requirements and have had to postpone taking those classes. I am supposedly fine in terms of time to graduate, but I don\u2019t doubt that may be because I have taken a few AP classes in high school, waiving some GEs. Irregardless of the case, it\u2019s still stressful as all hell to see that I\u2019m behind in certain requirements, not to mention I can\u2019t take classes with my friends, who I know I can trust in the event of group projects, or just in general to help each-other out.\n3) Some class times are shit. There exists a class which is held only on Saturday (time of day changing from semester to semester) because the professor works another job and presumably this is the only time they can teach.\n\nIn addition, the department can\u2019t seem to decide on a consistent language to teach. I have had to use four different languages, three of which I am using simultaneously for three different classes. And when the coding professor gets anal about coding syntax on a paper midterm, you can bet your ass that you are getting things wrong because having more than one coding language in your short term memory will naturally have some mix ups.\n\nOverall, there are simply too many frustrations and needless issues for anyone to safely say the department made an oversight. There has to be some sort of negligence or critical administrative failure going on, and the students are suffering as a result.",

For starters, use the school-wide alert system our tuition pays for to notify and calm students right when the incident was discovered, not 3 hours later. Also, please let us know how you went about investigating it in an hour with all of your resources, and we, the students who pay to go to a \"safe\" campus will deem the threat credible or not. I really do not understand your ignorance on this. Again, we don't live in a climate where these type of things can be put under the rug and taken lightheartedly. Trying to confront me about this isn't really what you should be doing, rather than reaching out to other students who are anxious enough about finals and have to deal with this type of threat.",

The main concern I had was the impact a note can have on the school and that the school is in a difficult situation. The main point i'm getting across is that this situation isn't so black and white. School is bad teachers are good. I understand the point you're making in that you want to feel safe, but you have to understand from the school's perspective that what they can do to make students feel safe is limited to police actions/response.\n\n1) Notifying students/faculty is difficult as they don't want to create a panic. It's a tough situation and they may not have been trained on how to react to the situation. It's important to get all the details before figuring out how to respond to the situation and notify the students. It wasn't an active threat as of that day so you can't expect immediate action.\n\nIn regards to 2) Most investigations don't actually describe how they investigate it. If the shooter knows how the investigations went, that would be a danger to the school.\n\n3) The police is in close proximity to the school, they don't need to be guarding doors to react to a threat. What's the difference between having cops everywhere tomorrow and having none the next day? What makes you think a shooter sees a lot of cops, waits a day, then starts shooting the next day? If you get into that mentality you'll never feel safe. The fact of the matter is unless they have cops stationed at school 24/7, you'll always be at the threat of a school shooter.\n\n4) Businesses will generally close anywhere if they receive report of a threat. A school is on a much larger scale and have more lasting implications to closing.",

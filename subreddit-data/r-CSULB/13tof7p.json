    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have applied to the Single Subject Teaching Credential on the Cal State Apply Portal, but I am confused about the EDSS 300 prerequisite class. Is this a class that I have to complete prior to being a CSULB student? Or is it that I am \"admitted\" to CSULB SSTC program conditionally on my passage of that class and the other requirements listed on the Admissions section of the program page? (https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-education/single-subject-credential-program-sscp/admission-to-the-single-subject)\n\nAlso, I am confused about the recommendation letter - most colleges require this to be included with the application, but it was not asked for in the application portal. Will I be prompted to submit the contact information of my recommender after my application is received? I'm not sure how to access the \"S4 @ The Beach\" site. \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "The first class in the program is EDSS300.  The application to the credential program is embedded in the class.  You can take several other classes at the same time (co-requisites), so you can take a full load .  These co-reqs are:\nEDSP 355b\nHSC 411\nEDP 301, 305 or 302 (any one of these). \n\nAll the testing, fingerprint and observation hours are also done during this class.  At the end of the semester, you turn in your application then you are officially in.  Until then, you are \u201cconditionally admitted \u201c - conditional on finishing your application and getting into the program.\n\nRead how to fill out the application here:  https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-education/single-subject-credential-program-sscp/applying-to-csulb",

Is it after the application is processed? As I said, I have already applied to the school but not much was asked of me in the Cal State Apply portal.",

            "comment": "Hi! Music Education major here :) you can look on the Bob Cole Conservatory of Music (BCCM) website for more information about the various jazz ensembles, but I can give the tldr version :))\n\nCorner Pocket (Vocal Jazz I) - the non audition group that anyone can join! I was a member last semester and it was tons of fun :) it's a good mix of both music and non music majors, and it doesn't feel too overwhelming whether you're a musician or just someone doing it for fun! I would say being familiar with sheet music is definitely helpful though!\n\nJazz and Tonic (Vocal Jazz II) - an audition only group and this is the next level above CP if you were specifically interested in an audition group - audition dates are TBD at the moment \n\nPacific Standard Time (I think it's Vocal Jazz III) - I know less about this one other than I believe it is the highest level of vocal jazz ensemble and is audition only - this group might only be open to Jazz Majors but I am not 100% sure. \n\nMore information on audition dates are usually closer to when the semester is starting :) if you look up BCCM Vocal Jazz Ensembles it should pop up with more info! \n\nHope this helps and I can try to answer any other questions!",

Do I just straight up enroll in the class and I won\u2019t have to audition?",

If I had to guess I'm pretty sure the \"audition\" for Corner Pocket is just so our director can hear your voice b/c if you're not someone within the music program then they'll want to get a better idea of your voice :)) I would just add it to your schedule now (I believe the info you have is correct) and reach out to Corner Pocket's director via email at Jonathan.Arenas@csulb.edu with any questions you may have! That way you'll at least have the spot on your schedule available and can get more info from him :)) I hope that helps!!",

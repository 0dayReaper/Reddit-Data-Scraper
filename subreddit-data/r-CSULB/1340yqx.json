            "comment": "Graduated in 2020, heart of the pandemic. \nI was at Microsoft at the time and had a nice time coasting being able to focus on graduating/the world burning. Once I graduated I stayed doing remote work up until they wanted us to be in office in Irvine or Santa Monica. Neither routes of which I wanted to drive to since I also had an 8yr old at the time. \n\nEnded up leaving and working at a non profit for individuals with learning disabilities that was close to my sons school. Ended up leaving after a few months to work for Honda out of state. Came back last year and was unemployed for a good few months up until November. I then worked at another non-profit helping low income families get help with their utilities. \n\nLeft that about a month ago and started working at CSULB now. Feel so much better having a stable job with great benefits, that\u2019s for sure",

The places that were hiring within my major and interest were in desperate need of people willing to work on site. \n\nGot a job at a non-profit that focuses on emotionally disturbed foster youth. Folks that could work remotely there were back-end folks with master's degrees who were admin.",

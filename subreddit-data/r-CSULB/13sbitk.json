However, you'll have to talk to your Dean and develop an improvement plan to stay in your program.  \n\nI was in the same situation for grad school and was able to recover on my third semester and subsequently graduate.",

Typically, undergrads are only guaranteed one semester on academic warning(probation). You will most likely get disqualified if after your first semester on probation, you don't raise your GPA (cumulative OR CSULB gpa) back up to at least a 2.0 OR if you don't meet the cutoff to be granted one more semester on warning (probation).

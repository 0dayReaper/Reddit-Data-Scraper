    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI want to transfer to the nursing program at CSULB this Spring; however, my college GPA is 3.763 (due to the 2 Bs, and one is in Physiology). I haven't taken the TEAS yet, but I'm planning to take them this June, I will try my best on it since I have a very low GPA. I will try my best to aim for a higher percentage, but I'm not sure if that would help me significantly with my current GPA. \n\nDo you guys think I can get accepted into the school with this GPA? I get really intimidated by the average GPA and got accepted to the program hence I hoped you guys can give your opinions. \n\n I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nThank you all!",

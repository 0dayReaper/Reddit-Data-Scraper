From my experience i didn\u2019t take neither since i did have transfer credits from AP exams, but i know some CC\u2019s in the area won\u2019t validate 104 as a pre req for a course you might need if you plan on taking summer classes. To be honest meet with an advisor(which i think they require you do as part of your SOAR) to see which they would recommend for you, but ultimately it is your choice!",

The content in CHLS 104 and AFRS 104 focus in reading and writing but the content is in Chicano/Latina Studied and Africana Studies. Same classes, just the content is more general in English and more culturally specific in the studies classes.",

The transition to university reading and writing can be a lot if you aren\u2019t strong in these areas. \n\nThese classes aren\u2019t regular high school literature-based English classes. They focus on non-fiction reading, writing, and research. \n\nWriting in college is not the same as writing in high school. There\u2019s not a lot of basic 5-paragraph essays or timed writing. These classes prepare you to read longer and more complicated texts and write longer essays and writing projects as well as short reading responses.\n\nTaking 100A gives you extra practice. It\u2019s a bit more basic than 100B. My recommendation is always take 100A in the fall and 100B in the spring. I think all students benefit from the whole year, but it\u2019s really up to you and how confident you are in reading and writing.",

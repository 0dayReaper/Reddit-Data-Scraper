(Think of the trend where people where saying \u201chow old were you when you realized you weren\u2019t ugly, you just didn\u2019t fit the mold of European beauty standards) \nPeople of color in this country (as a group\u2014so don\u2019t give me any bullshit about the sell out exceptions to the rules) are not in a position of power. So when we display pride in our culture, our skin, our heritage, etc\u2026 it\u2019s not analogous to when white people do it because when white people do it (since they are already in a position of power and reflect the standard of society) they are expressing their pride as being the \u201cmaster oppressor race\u201d or whatever, whereas when we express pride it\u2019s to express that despite all the bullshit\u2014we are human, we are people and no one will make us feel like less than. \nHonestly, I don\u2019t think any of you white chauvinists will take anything I said seriously, but I hope someone who\u2019s confused about the situation understands why things like these are important to POC.",

I\u2019m sure we all know that universities across the nation no more than 60-70 years ago were predominantly white and discriminated applications on the basis of race. Inhibiting black and brown communities from achieving higher education and celebrating these accomplishments that white people have had the privilege of celebrating for the longest.\n\nThese cultural ceremonies celebrate, in my opinion, the accomplishments of people in these communities whether it be Pacific Islanders, black, brown communities, etc. They are also celebrating the culture within the ceremony as well that are a part of these communities. If you want to be ally, you\u2019re more than welcome to support. \n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t make sense for me, as a brown person, to partake in a Pacific Islanders ceremony, AFRS ceremony, etc. bc it isn\u2019t my culture. I Can learn it, support it and even partake in some of the practices as long as I respect it but at the end of the day it isn\u2019t MY culture. \n\nI would have loved to have seen each and every single culture celebrated at commencement but Conoley has/had other plans. A lot of these ceremonies are club/department led, as far as I know. \n\nYour comments on the \u201cprogressive movement successfully revering 60 years of civil rights progress by enacting policy that would please the KKK.\u201d Is what I especially take issue with. How is it reversing it? The ability to celebrate our cultures openly, cultures that at one point were demonized at one point isn\u2019t reversing the civil rights progress or movements. Having our own ceremonies that celebrate our culture at a college institution is one of the things that the civil rights movement gave us.",

Instead I found unthinking, uncompromising, uninformed bigots who parrot Twitter talking points who have lived their entire lives online and devoid of reality. \n\nAnd as to your question regarding Shane Gillis, you might want to sit down for this one; yes, he was fairly treated. He was given the option to delete said Tweets and issue an apology or stand by his jokes and be fired, and, because he has more character and backbone than you will ever possess, decided to stand by his prior actions, resulting in his termination.

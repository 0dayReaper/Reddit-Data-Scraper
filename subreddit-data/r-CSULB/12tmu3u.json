    "postText": "Im pretty sure no one here will know what this is, but who knows. I go to CSUF and my cost of school is covered by the Alan Pattee Fee Waiver(for people whose parent is a fallen law enforcement officer and are California residents). Someone reached out to me who will be attending CSULB in the fall and will also be using it, however we are really struggling to find the contact information for the person who is in charge of it. No one at financial aid knows what it is which has made this whole thing a lot harder.",

I sent them an email asking about the Alan Pattee waiver and included documents for proof of eligibility and they had it done in about a week.",

    "postText": "Has anyone else noticed this? I want to work on my labs on weekends, and the stated hours of operation of VEC and ECS are 8am to 8pm on Saturdays and Sundays. But most of the time, the buildings are locked by 6pm. Sometimes they\u2019re locked early on Fridays too, by around 8 or 9pm, even though hours of operation are until 11pm. This has been consistently happening all of last semester and this semester too. \n\nDuring spring break, the EE department had posted the hours that labs were available for us to use so we could work on labs and projects, but the ECS building ended up being locked before the posted hours of operation were over and before those open lab hours were over. \n\nI tried every single door on every floor that was accessible from the outside and they were all locked. Even if I was able to enter from another floor, that would just mean that students with mobility issues would be SoL because there\u2019s no entrance open on the first floor. \n\nWith final projects coming up, I imagine this will be more of an issue for more students. I\u2019m going to email the dean, and I\u2019m hoping other students can email them too. First they can\u2019t fix an elevator and now they can\u2019t bother to keep the building open when it\u2019s supposed to be open. I\u2019m sick of having to guess whether or not I\u2019ll be able to get into the labs and finish up the work that I need to do to finish my degree.",

            "comment": "I notice during my undergrad pre 2019 when the ecs building used to be open almost 24 hours for the mae computer labs. The building would be physically locked after 11 but the lab techs would basically tell us that they were gonna lock the doors so when we left to turn off the light. Same thing with the library where it used to close at 12 am everyday and be 24 hours for the last two weeks of school. When I went back for my masters post Covid, everything closed early. For ecs, I know they don\u2019t follow their hours, but if you know someone in the building, you can call them to open the door.",

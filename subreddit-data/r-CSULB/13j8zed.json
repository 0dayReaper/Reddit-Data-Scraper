    "postText": "So I just dropped 1 out of 2 of my summer classes bc I realized I didn\u2019t need it for my major but I already paid for it out of pocket. And I\u2019m confused if I\u2019ll get a refund for that class automatically or if I have to contact someone from the school about that, or if I just won\u2019t get a refund at alll Does anyone know or have had experienced that before?",

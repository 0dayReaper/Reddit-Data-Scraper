It was never noisy for me, but I lucked out in having a good roommate. The RA\u2019s are chill af. \n\nIf you want to go shopping, it\u2019s like a 5 minute drive behind the dorms to like a shopping district. Trade joes, rite aid, etc., if you want some snacks and stuff. \n\nYou\u2019re pretty lucky as well that Parkside gets the second to last stop before the shuttle loops around, so that saved me some time going to my 1 far away class. \n\nThere\u2019s not really much else to say. It\u2019s a normal dorm like every other. If this is your first time dorming I can give tips!",

I graduated in 2022. \n\nFirst off, you are going to share a bathroom with multiple people no matter hillside or parkside north.  Not sure how many people you\u2019ll share with in hillside, but each PSN bathroom (6 toilets/ showers in the communal, and 1 additional toilet/ shower separate from the communal) is shared with about 24 students on average. \n\nIf you want maturity, you should go to Beachside. But since you listed only parkside north and hillside, you have to pick. Hillside does have the upperclassmen, who usually are more mature. But parkside north has the better amenities. Why not live in PSN and just have friends/ hangout in Hillside?",

It\u2019s up to you to gather the information out there to make the choice you least regret/ most enjoy.  It all comes down to what you value most: very nice living conditions (PSN) or like minded neighbors (HS). \n\nPersonally I believe living in PSN you can change the people around you with the buddies you want and use your room only as a bed. While if you live in HS, you can\u2019t change the room to be better or newer",

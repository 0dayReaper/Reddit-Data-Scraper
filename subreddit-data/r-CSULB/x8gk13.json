The president gets a raise for doing the bare minimum while students in dorms and classrooms are at risk of heatstroke?? We pay thousands upon thousands of dollars each semester, how can they not equip the school AND dorms with A/C?? Knowing damn well Los Angeles county is literal hell during these months??\n\n Reminds me of last semester when the PR from the school came into our class to talk and in our faces LAUGHED that students made the graduation petition that circled around Spring semester. They pointed out it was ridiculous for us to think we have a voice/choice when the school's plans are solidified and the truth is they aren't willing to listen if it doesn't convinience them. What a surprise considering the school is built on Native American land lmfao. \n\nYet, when something doesn't go their way or a situation stains the school's reputation, they come crying to us asking to be \"understanding\"  this school is fucking ridiculous and I hope everyone living on campus and those who have classes in scorching hot classrooms fight long and hard!",

I worked as a staff member at CSULB and and have sat in on meetings with administrators where I was shocked at how blind they were to the REAL needs of their students. Money gets thrown at performative events and  programs while programs and departments that actually make a difference and take into account students well-being are cut or defunded with no explanation. Staff members are hired based on nepotism and brown nosing. Ugh, I cannot tell you how many staff members were hired without proper procedure or REASON aside from Nepotism. These same folks are also culturally insensitive and administration is FILLED with white privilege. They  step on underpaid and overworked staff that actually care to get to the top. I\u2019ve advocated for extra funds to be used in a way that mattered for students. For example, create accessible scholarships students with this money or assist in paying for mental health services off campus.. etc\u2026 but NOPE. They shot down my ideas and used the money to fund redundant and performative programs (like a virtual magic show) that have no real impact on students. I apologize for my venting but I stand with you all and support you all in your advocacy. The fact that they don\u2019t listen to their students was a huge reason I left.",

Their performative messages about togetherness and \"here for you\" is nonsense. They are forcefully sending back most students and faculty because THATS how they make money. The pandemic is still killing people....it's unnecessary to force people back when there are alternatives. Especially when most of my students have expressed their desire to have both remote and in person options. Every other college I work for (adjunct for 4 campuses) were able to accommodate. This school doesn't care about students OR faculty. But hey, as long as the president and their cronies got a raise that's all that matters, right?",

It has come to many people's attention that not only we are experiencing hotter conditions on campus but also no AC for these art buildings. These buildings have lacked maintenance, no ventilation, and no AC. The buildings are so run down that people have poked holes in the walls in order to get some type of air. Besides the neglected buildings with no AC for their students, the dean blesses the student by appearing to these classes for 1 minute just to tell these suffering students that these conditions \" could be worse\" while laughing it off. Not only was the complaints of students not taken seriously but they were being laughed at as well. When the students did a protest to voice their concerns and ask questions about why their is there no AC being installed? The answer was nothing more than \" We can't afford it\". When asked again why isn't there any money being used and put into these essentials, the dean laughed again stating \" it's above my pay grade\". This school is constantly receiving money from grants, donors, and students paying higher tuition every year, but somehow can't put in few AC units into these buildings for said students? The president of CSULB received a raise of 30 percent, being top 3rd paid president with a salary nearly of 500K. Just watch and see for yourself how CSULB has been neglecting their very own students.  \nhttps://sigtrib.com/csulb-students-hold-walk-out-over-lack-of-air-conditioning-during-heatwave%EF%BF%BC/  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiAxuYTZBjU&amp;ab\\_channel=22WestVideo",

Opening walls to install duct and opening ceilings to install diffusers alone would be a huge chunk of money, especially in a 3 story building with at least 40 rooms. And the cost of equipment to push out enough air comfortably is through the fucking roof rn, not to mention lead time. Just doesn\u2019t seem economically feasible atm to me.

I\u2019m just pointing out your specific logic in saying that \u201cmost of the school\u201d would need their AC replaced in order to give the dorms/art classrooms decent AC and ventilation is kind of dumb. And unless you magically know exactly what the school\u2019s budget is, idk how you could determine if it\u2019s \u201ceconomically feasible\u201d or not. Considering the president was able to give herself a twenty percent raise for no reason, I would hope that they have enough in the budget to actually listen to the needs of the students.",

I.e. \u201cin our faces LAUGHED that students made the graduation petition.\u201d\n\nUpgrade old building with modern day HVAC systems is not cheap and while your statement about paying tuition is a fair one to be made, your stance is taken as if the university does not have to pay for cost of just staying open. I.e. cost of electricity, water, garbage, school sponsored bus transport, not to mention cost of non academic faculty. \n\nI digress, while you make valid points it appears to be biased and the tone that your writing produces is certainly over the top. Like bro, it ain\u2019t even in the 100 degree out. Is the weather uncomfortable, yeah, but it\u2019s not hot as hell.",

I feel like a lot of the decent teachers are gone and we\u2019re left with very few who are not so great. I\u2019ve had Hou for 310 but he had his class extremely difficult and hard to follow. So any recommendations would be appreciated!!",

I know he\u2019s not the most popular, but if you learn his teaching/testing style, it\u2019s really easy to get an A in his class. I took labor with him and it was my favorite class that semester. He\u2019s not for everyone for sure though.",

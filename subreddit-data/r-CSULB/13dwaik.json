Super easy, helpful and chill. 5 one page reflections, 5 quizzes and a 10 page essay that was super well organized so it wasn't too much (the draft is due earlier and is 5 pages so you get half done by the time the actual paper's due) and it's easy to write since you're talking about your experieces",

Everything else is less than 1000 words. We had one presentation and in general he grades really easy for everything. You really only need to attend the peer review sessions and the day of the presentation.",

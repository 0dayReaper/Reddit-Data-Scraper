Bit about me I'm a guy, studio arts/animation major, usually go to bed at 2am (constantly trying to fix that but I have sleep issues), introverted but can be social, transfer student going into my 3rd semester so whatever year you consider that. Honestly my schedule looks pretty busy next semester so idk how often we'll actually interact. Don't know what else to say so dm me if you want to know more.",

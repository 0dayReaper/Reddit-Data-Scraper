    "postText": "Its my first time writing on reddit.. but I am looking for a roommate. I'm a freshman at CSULB, 19, female, and a psychology major. I am Korean and speak Korean too so if ur a girl who speaks Korean that'd be fun but ur ethnicity doesn't matter to me. For pros im on the cleaner side, I like making food so I can probably cook for u too, I'm pretty sociable and open to making new friends so if you bring ur friends over I probably won't mind as long as they're nice and respectful, and for cons... i stay up pretty late, I play league of legends, and I cry a lot",

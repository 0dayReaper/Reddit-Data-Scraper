I keep seeing people comment on how it sucks which is scaring me but that\u2019s mainly a commuter problem right? please tell me it is",

You can definitely make lots of friends living on campus with ease. Hang out in your common room or join some clubs to meet others. CSULB does frequent social events but you won\u2019t find any on campus parties here.",

But there\u2019s a lot of clubs and greek life options. Hell you can just talk with your classmates and make friends.",

You got this!!",

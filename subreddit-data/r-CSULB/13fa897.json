    "postText": "Kind of a dumb question but can I still graduate if I get a D in one class? It was some poor planning on my part and honestly im just trying to get enough points on my final to end up with a C. But if that doesn\u2019t happen can I still graduate with a D? I transferred into school and graduated my CC with a D on my transcripts in American government, so would it be the same here?",

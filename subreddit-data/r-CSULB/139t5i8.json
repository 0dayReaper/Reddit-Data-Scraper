    "postText": "Hi! Comm Studies major here seeking a little bit of advice. I\u2019m considering adding a minor, either Graphic Design or Journalism/PR. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m considering Graphic Design is that I\u2019ve always been interested in art (but never went so far as pursuing it in the first place and now I\u2019m way too far in to make the switch). I took a few art classes back in Fullerton Community College and really enjoyed them. A family friend also had a certificate in Illustration in Fullerton CC and had raved about the department.\n\nBut the thing is I\u2019m way too far in to do a complete major change as of right now. \n\nWould getting a minor or certificate in Graphic Design at a local community college make a different in my case? If so, which one is better - minor or certificate? Or would I be better off taking courses online to save money? If you are a minor in Graphic Design or Journalism, could you tell me what is it like? \n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

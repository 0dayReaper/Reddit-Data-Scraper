I left right after walking in because I was not trying to stay since they refuse to call out our names. However I do wish I stayed to boo our president\u2026\n\nAnyways, I would say it\u2019s definitely a cool experience to be able to walk in the stadium but wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily a must. If anything, you could always leave after walking since it is mostly just speeches.\n\nAlso don\u2019t feel bad for walking out a good majority of CoE graduates were dipping right after. I\u2019m sure it will be like that for the rest of the colleges.",

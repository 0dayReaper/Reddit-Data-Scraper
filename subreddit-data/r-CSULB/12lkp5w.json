The class was fully virtual and it was by far the easiest class I have ever taken in any institution (and it\u2019s not an exaggeration) I have been in despite her low rating on the web. I was fully prepared for the class and was blown away on how easy it was with minimal work but also learned a lot . I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s her teaching style changed for physical lecture, but I guess that it shouldn\u2019t be that much of a difference in between.",

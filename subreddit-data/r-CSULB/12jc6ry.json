Any know if tickets can be transferred in the case that some people end up having to give them up? I was hoping to celebrate my master's with what seems like a beautiful ceremony and not the cheap-halfassery that's promised at some stadium I don't give a damn about.",

Honestly everyone should\u2019ve seen this coming, we sold out quickly last year, and almost every university with a Latin Grad ceremony is having the same problems.

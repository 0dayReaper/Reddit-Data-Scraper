After looking more closely I realized the letter was addressed to another person. All of the other information like my address, email, etc was mine. I called the admissions department and they said it was a mistake and my application is still under evaluation. Love that.",

The person on the phone couldn't be bothered. Honestly sounded a little annoyed with me for calling about it even lol",

I genuinely want to to hear the different opinions on the matter. \n\nPersonally I feel like if true, it is fucked up because the message this student ran with does not resonate with the group the student is allegedly involved. \n\nI just think ASI should be fully transparent with the student body, at the end of the day, they are elected by us according to the values we believe in.",

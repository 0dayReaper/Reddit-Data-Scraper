I remember I was taking a 100 level class and the grad student grading my stuff took off a point because they swore something I mentioned wasn\u2019t talked about. So I wrote them a email that basically said \u201cfuck you you\u2019re wrong\u201d in a nice way, then when I realized it happened to a lot of people, someone went to the prof and the prof was like \u201cy\u2019all can have that point\u201d. It was a pass or fail class and literally we only needed to do 12 out of the 15 assignments to pass. I wasn\u2019t gonna give a whole lot of effort for that class but they weren\u2019t about to dock me a point for not paying attention",

I preferably want to live in standard housing in a double room with one roommate. What halls or buildings in Hillside have a standard double room?",

These dorms are technically called double room - plus and are more expensive. \n\nThe suite style dorms are called double room - standard and are in the A-F and international house. They are the cheapest double rooms. \n\nMore details on the differences are here: [https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/university-housing-residential-life/residential-villages](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/university-housing-residential-life/residential-villages)\n\nFeel free to dm me if you have more random questions; I have lived in both hillside and parkside.",

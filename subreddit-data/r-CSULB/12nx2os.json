    "postText": "I just completed my first year and I was wondering if I could still switch my major before I got behind on my degree. The problem is that I took Survey of Calculus 1 and have not retaken calc, so I would possibly be a semester behind. However I\u2019ve also taken Chem 111A and currently taking 111B so those would be covered. Also, I am taking BIOL211 but I don\u2019t know if it would transfer over since it says I need BIOL200. Thoughts or suggestions?",

            "comment": "Sup, biomed major here! My advice for u is if u wanna catch up, try talk to ur advisor abt taking the classes at a community college. As a first year (I'm assuming u came straight from high school) u get abt 60-70 transferrable units and the calc sequence is 10 units. Try checking assist.org for whichever community college is closest to u so I see what classes can take calcs place. \nAlso: I'd recommend seeing which classes can take the place of math 370A (applied mathematics) bc that class is hard to take here",

            "comment": "Bio will be fine. The 211 series are for majors so they'll be able to be substituted for the watered down version such as Bio 200. Unfortunately your case for math is the reverse scenario. \n\nIt's the calc that you'll have to make up asap since engineering needs calc 1-3 and another math class after that. Id talk to an advisor to see how you can go about navigating summer terms and such for calc, as being behind 1 year in math for engineering may as well be a 1 year lag for undergrad progress",

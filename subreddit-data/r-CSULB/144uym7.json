Biology can be for other jobs as well because it's a broad subject.\n\nForensic crime is also a very popular career path, so I would keep that in mind. Don't forget you can double major or major with a minor if you're up for that. Keep in mind they can be hard majors.\n\nAgain- it's honestly up to you. Both of them are pretty good in terms of jobs for each major, but a job in forensics may be harder to find (but not impossible) and doesn't always pay great. But a biology degree can be pretty versatile. Don't stress too much, I didn't know what major I wanted until much later and swapped into it. Good luck, I hope everything goes well for you!",

A lot of analytical work goes into that, more biochemistry/chemistry since you need to be able to understand/read analytical data.\nYou might change your mind as you go through your degree. \nbest to choose something you feel you\u2019re capable of doing, first semester or year alot of freshman change degrees because of how tough some of the course work is. \nIf you are strong with math/sciences then go for biology. \nNot sure what job opportunities come from marketing, so I recommend doing as much research as possible.",

            "comment": "I'd go with marketing for much more flexibility. Biology labs are grueling, and it would take longer to graduate.\n\nMeet some crime investigators irl (decide whether you wanted local government or private) and network (luckily a lot in this So Cal area), and see if it's a good culture fit or not. If you like that route, I suspect adding a criminal justice degree or something would be a better fit than biology. I'd be concerned if they wanted someone with that much anatomy knowledge (like a coroner) they'd instead actually be looking for successful completion of medical school.\n\nWith marketing, it's all about networking, so I'd make a linkedin and start just connecting with everyone you know and gun for landing internships and or stacking up retail experience at a recognized name retailer asap. I'd also recommend at least minoring in communications.",

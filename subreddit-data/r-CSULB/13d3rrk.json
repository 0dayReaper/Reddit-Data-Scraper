If you receive a failing grade both times you can submit a request to take it a 3rd time. If approved you can get your grades averaged assuming you pass the 3rd time. If you fail a 3rd time I believe that\u2019s just it and you gotta decide if you switch majors or drop out.",

            "comment": "Really depends if the class is a requirement for your major. If it is, then talk to your advisor to see if there is another option you can take. If it\u2019s not for your major, ask your advisor if you can pass with a D. If it\u2019s lower division, you can take it at a ccc. Definitely talk to your advisor either way, I\u2019m going through something similar, and my advisor was able to give me an option in taking another class that counts for the same requirement.",

Talk to your professor to see if there\u2019s a chance you could pass the final, or if you do anything, though at this point, they might say no, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. Suggest if you could take an incomplete, though those usually are given if you have medical reasons or a family member passed away. Or withdraw if you have a catastrophic or medical reason. There isn\u2019t much at this point tho tbh, but your advisor can give you a better response. Good luck!",

Community college is the best decision you can make and can also help you push you to the direction you want and not waste thousands at a university when you\u2019re first starting out even you\u2019re financial aid covered at LB. By the looks of it you still don\u2019t know what you want to do and going to a cc will really make you get a feel of things. Get involved i will say that, get involved as much you as you can at your community college i think its important to change the atmosphere in CCs and also get rid of the idiotic stigmas against them.",

CC is perfect for \u201cundeclared\u201d since you can take whatever you want and they won\u2019t rush you to do XYZ. If you\u2019re interested in health care, they have a lot of health care related courses you can take and start working in healthcare within one semester to see if it\u2019s a good fit for you.",

In order to succeed in community college you have to push yourself because if you are not careful you can end up being at community college for years! (Counselors are not as helpful, you are basically on your own).  Nursing is extremely competitive at community college, more-so than at cal states. I would suggest reading the community college reddit page to see if people are writing about the nursing programs. I know a lot of people who had to wait a year before being accepted to any nursing programs at community college. I know El Camino and Harbor always had waiting lists for theres. (A lot of LVNs go to community college to get their RNs, so they have first dibs).  I went to community college first, right choice for me. However, my brother went to Cal states first and it was the best decision for him. My brother would have hated going to a community college probably would have drop out like many others at community college.",

It's wayyy cheaper especially if you're there just trying to grind out GE/required classes to transfer. Social life *can* exist if that's what you're worried about, but do know most people are there grinding and probably have a daytime job so they're not there to hang out after class to make friends.",

            "comment": "Community college 100%. Make sure to do well in all science classes, most people in my nursing cohort had 4.0 in their science classes and high over all GPA and study up for the TEAs test. \nAt your community college you can talk with an academic counselor and they can help you decide what classes to take to get into a CSU vs UC or the ability to get into both for more options. Plus it\u2019s so so soooo much cheaper. I did all of my pre-nursing classes between Fullerton and cypress college and found they had good professors between the two. Also since they are sister schools all the credits were easily transferred.\n\nEdited to add: if you\u2019re trying to get into nursing at a CC, most hospitals require BSN so you\u2019d have to end up going for your RN to BSN. I\u2019d just do the pre-nursing classes and then take the BSN program somewhere.",

If anything, it\u2019s also a great opportunity to finish your GE\u2019s at a lower cost. I would recommend looking at assist.org and browsing the majors you\u2019re interested in and looking at the transfer requirements.",

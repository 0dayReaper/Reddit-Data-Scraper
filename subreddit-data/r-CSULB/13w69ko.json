Does the group leader pick for us and we're stuck paying for that room type? They make the details so vague.",

Even if on your application you said you preferred Parkside, you can still choose Hillside, for example, as your final dorm. Of course, Alamitos/Cerritos (I can\u2019t remember which one) is the honors building so non-honors cannot live there. \n\nAs far as selection goes, once room selection opens (you will be given a date and time for your selection if you haven\u2019t already) then you and your roommate (if you have one) have to agree on which village and room (Parkside, Hillside, Beachside, double standard, double premium, etc.). I\u2019m sure you know, but some rooms are more expensive than others so make sure everyone agrees. \n\nRooms are first come first serve so keep in contact with your roommate or group to see who has the earliest selection time. This is especially important because if you\u2019re in a group then only the group leader can select rooms. If say, you, have the earliest selection time but aren\u2019t group leader,  your current group leader will have to make you the new group leader so you can select the room and place everyone in their rooms with their roommate.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a group then you don\u2019t have to worry about that. Additionally, if you don\u2019t have a roommate then you obviously don\u2019t have to worry about coordinating. If you\u2019re single, then find any bed space available.",

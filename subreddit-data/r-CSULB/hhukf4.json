    "postText": "**BIGGEST DISCLAIMER:** \n\n***Financial Aid is on a case by case basis***. ***Reddit will not be able to answer your questions unless they are in the greatest broad terms***. **What works for one person may not apply to you. The financial aid office exists for a reason, their staff is there for a reason.**\n\nYou will receive a lot of helpful anecdotal stories through reddit, but it is your job as a responsible student and adult to call the Financial Aid office 562-985-8403 to make sure your question is answered correctly and specifically to you. The longest call I have ever been was about 30 minutes with the shortest being 2 minutes. You can also set up an in person appointment using the [join the queue](https://kiosk.na1.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/10000000110) option if you need to go more depth into your questions. These are basic answers to broad and basic questions that keep being asked.\n\n***What is financial aid and how do I apply? Minimum classes I need to take?***\n\n[This](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/paying-for-college/financial-aid). Read it and use it to apply if you need to. You can also scheduled a meeting with a financial aid advisor [here](https://kiosk.na1.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/10000000110) to talk about the process. If you are an undocumented person or AB540 student you can apply for aid and the middle class family scholarship, I would recommend reaching out to the Dream Success Center (562-985-5587) and financial aid as well. The minimum classes you need to take is 12 units worth and maintain at least a 2.0 grade average less you go on probation.\n\n***When is my financial aid posting? Why have I not gotten my aid yet?***\n\nFinancial aid should be posting around now all the way till the end of July and even until August. This depends on the academic program you are in. Some students received their aid packets all the way in early may (graduates). If you are unsure or are worried about your potential financial aid packet call financial aid to see what the current state of your packet is.\n\n***What happens if my financial aid doesn't cover all my tuition?***\n\nIf your aid doesn't cover all your tuition you have to go big brain time and calculate it yourself. You will subtract your aid from your tuition . You will pay whatever is left over up front so that you are not dropped from your classes. If you can not pay whatever is left up front you can set up payment plans on mycsulb (more info [here](https://www.csulb.edu/enrollment-services/student-financial-services-how-to-guides#how-to-enroll-in-a-payment-plan)) or you can go to the bursars office on the first floor of brotman hall and set it up in person.\n\n***What happens to the extra money? Can I spend it however I want?***\n\nAny extra money over tuition/board will be mailed to you in the form of a check if you have not set a direct deposit to your bank account. You may spend it however you like, you are an adult. If it runs out you won't be getting any until the next semester so that's on you. Some scholarships like the bookstore scholarship will only allow you to use it at certain locations and certain things so do keep that in mind?\n\n***Why am I getting only loans?***\n\nIf you have received only loans, when you usually get financial aid it usually means you did not qualify based on you and your parents income. Records look back two years so (2018). If there was a drastic change in income since then (death or parent/loss of job) call the financial aid office and file an [income appeal](https://es-forms.es.csulb.edu/forms/2021_FSOPRJ.php). This **DOES NOT** guarantee you get aid but is the first step forward. Make sure to call the financial aid office first to make sure there is no error on their part.\n\n***Subsidized loans vs Unsubsidized loans? Should I take both?***\n\n***Subsidized:*** You will not incur interest while you are still enrolled in school. In most cases the government pays the interest on this loan. **Unsubsidized:** Interest will start to incur as soon as the loan is taken out/ disbursed.\n\nAs for which is better? Subsidized loans are more beneficial to you because you don't need to pay back right away, but unsubsidized loans are usually larger and can cover more expenses. More information can be found [here](https://www.csulb.edu/financial-aid/loan-information) in addition thing such as loan forgiveness if you choose a public service/teacher route.\n\n***Will COVID affect financial aid? Will it affect me in the fall?***\n\nYes, it already has and probably not. Their have already been deductions. The CSU system lost 6 million in aid this summer alone. Is there anything concrete for fall? Unknown at this point. Keep your eyes open for any info coming forward.\n\nAs you can see, in all these questions, calling financial aid (562-985-8403) is pretty much your go to answer to make sure you know where you stand in financial Aid. I can't stress how important it is to actually reach out and get the help and questions answered you need by going to the services offered by the university.",

If they have not and you expect, call the financial aid office. Several people have done that and have has their questions answered.",

Normally you would check the \"no file\" For the year you fill out FAFSA. You give your 1098T form to your tax filer to add to taxes so it's not really applicable since you file your taxes but you should always have a copy just in case. I would reccomend calling the financial aid office about your case. You always want to make sure everything is done correctly so that in the future they don't make a case that you were not filing correctly and all of sudden owe money.\n\nJudging from your comment, are you saying you only filed once and never again but are still getting aid.",

The minimum  income is $12200 for federal, lower for state, because of the standard deduction. Outside of OP's comment,  there's a difference between have to file and can/should you file. Some people should file even if they're under the filing requirement so they get withheld taxes back or earned income credit. It's good for people to file if they can.",

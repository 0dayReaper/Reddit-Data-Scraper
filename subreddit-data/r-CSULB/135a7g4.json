Are you supposed to give a little speech or something when you accept your award? \n\nI\u2019m super socially awkward so ofc I\u2019m already overthinking about any possible interactions. \ud83d\ude2d",

We socialized for sure, but I mean if you really don't want to socialize there's no need. Just had a great time with peers and firms \ud83e\udd1d",

    "postText": "Hiii all my name is Joseph,\n\nI'm looking for a roommate/roommates for Beachside 3rd Floor.\n\nHere is a small rundown about me:\n\nI'm currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science. I like to say that i'm a pretty extroverted, social person, who enjoys meeting new people. If i were to describe my personality it would most likely fall into loud and goofy. But i do try to respect the boundaries of other people \n\nI typically try to sleep between 12-2am and try to get up no later than 10.\n\nI don't smoke but I don't mind people around me who do it. \n\nI try to clean and tidy up my living space everyday.\n\nI live in the bay area and grew up there. \n\nI listen to a lot of Krnb, Kpop, and occasionally EDM and rap. \n\nUsually on my free time I watch anime or kdramas or  hang out with friends. I also program on my free time.\n\nIf you are interested please dm me, i dont bite :) you can also dm me on instagram : joseph.daavid",

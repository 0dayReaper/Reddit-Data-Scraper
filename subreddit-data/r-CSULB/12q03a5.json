    "postText": "Was accepted for spring 23 as a fine art student. I was originally a psych major so I\u2019ve done some psych classes that are needed already. Then switched to fine art and took classes for that. I want to double major now what are the odds of them accepting once I meet with counselor. 4.0 cumulative gpa thus far. I\u2019m meeting with counselor at my cc Wednesday so maybe I can add a summer class or 2 to help meet more of psych major requirements to help my odds. Thoughts?",

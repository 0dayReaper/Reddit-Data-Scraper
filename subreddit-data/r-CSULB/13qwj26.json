My \u201coh shit\u201d moment was when I got called back after two different interviews to say I didn\u2019t get the job, and I was actually relieved. It was frustrating to come to that realization after the hell that was student teaching and all the work I put in. But honestly, now that I\u2019ve put all that behind me and work in the private sector I couldn\u2019t be happier.",

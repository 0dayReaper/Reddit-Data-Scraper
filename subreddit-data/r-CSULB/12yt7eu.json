    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm planning on graduating next semester in the Fall. I wanted to take grad pics and all that but understand that there is not graduation ceremony for those graduating during the Fall semester.\n\nMy question is should I try to take grad photos now? I'm just wondering if I'll be able to even get a cap and gown since there's no ceremony next semester, if that makes sense. I don't want to miss out on getting some pictures taken as I at least wanted some sort of graduating memory from this school after all this work. I appreciate any response!",

If you\u2019re okay with it I can share my website with you via DM. \n\nFall is a diff vibe. Cooler and the trees are doing that fall thing lol.",

I went ahead and bought everything so I could take pictures with my family and friends, but I probably won\u2019t take graduation photos until I\u2019m done in December.\n\nMy main reason is because I have braces LOL and I\u2019m almost positive I\u2019ll have them off by then. Another reason is because I don\u2019t want all the attention from my friends and family until I\u2019m actually DONE DONE. Congratulations btw, we\u2019re almost done!",

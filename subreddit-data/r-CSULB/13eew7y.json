    "postText": "Hello,\n\nSomehow I am just becoming aware of the GWAR / GPE test that's due June 2nd. I'm transferring in the fall and did not do well in writing so I'm suddenly feeling really panicked.\n\nSo please help me, GWAR and GPE test are the same thing or different?  \n\n\nI was under the impression that the GWAR writing was simply due before graduating, not due in order to keep your admission. So if you get a poor score your acceptance will get rescinded?\n\n  \nI emailed the testing department to see if they could advise me as well.",

            "comment": "The GPE is the placement exam for the Graduate Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) needed to graduate. Every student has to take an upper-division, writing intensive class to fulfill the GWAR.\n\nStudents take the GPE in their junior year or upon transferring in. Students who don\u2019t score an 11 or above on the placement exam have to take an additional course to improve their writing skills before taking the required class.\n\nYou should register for the test ASAP in case you end up having to take the additional writing class. Plus, at some point, they will hold your registration if you haven\u2019t taken it. GWAR can hold up graduation, so they don\u2019t mess around.",

            "comment": "Yes GWAR/GPE both names are the same for the assessment you will only take one assessment. The assessment doesn't affect your eligibility to attend csulb it will only show how many writing classes you will have to take in order to graduate. Don't panic it is an easy assessment basically you will have to write an essay answering a prompt and if you get the highest score you will still need to take one writing class however if you get a lower grade you will probably take 2 or 3 classes depending on your grade. I will suggest signing up asap and attend the workshops they provide for that so that you have an idea on what the assessment will be like.",

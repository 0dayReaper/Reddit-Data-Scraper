Currently working as a behavor therapist, I always knew I wasn't going to work in a career related to my major. I was hoping I would figure out what I wanted to do during my undergrad and It definitely helped plus I gained a unique perspective from anthro that I think can be applied in any job. Now, to do the stuff I actually want to do haha",

    "postText": "Hi- anyone get any grad school admission decisions yet? My program's deadline was March 15th and my app has been \"submitted to the department for review\", but when I was checking my app, the site said that the deadline is now June 1st. Do y'all think that means I have to wait until June to hear back?\n\nJust stressing over trying to find housing last minute if I do get in, since it seems like I'll have to wait a while.",

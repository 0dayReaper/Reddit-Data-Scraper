If you only eat lunch and dinner with the occasional breakfast, the block plan is perfect. I switched to the 10 plan because i eat lunch and dinner and usually i\u2019m not here on weekends",

If you do the math (210 meals divided by 16 weeks, including finals, divided by 7 days per week) that's 1.825 meals per day, which is plenty if you only occasionally go home, eat out, or just eat snacks/ramen in your room. 19 is too many per week. And 10 per week is too few unless you go home every weekend.",

You will probably end up having to eat out at least once a week, but with options close by and on campus you should be fine even if you don\u2019t plan on making stuff yourself. I do highly recommend amassing a good amount of snacks, though. You can always walk to campus and buy from the vending machines, but it\u2019s frankly a hassle.\n\nAlso, if I had to rec a dining hall, go to Parkside for the pizza",

But since the roommate selection date is coming up, how do you choose ur roommate? Are you gonna write a short bio or how else? by just looking at a few answers we filled out during the housing application? I am so confused haha and what if my roommate wants to dorm somewhere else and i wanna dorm at los alamitos? would we be rematched or something? Do we share pictures of ourselves?",

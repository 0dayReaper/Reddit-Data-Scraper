I got my admission decision over a month ago at this point and their application is still \u201cin review\u201d. Is this normal or should he reach out to CSULB? I\u2019m mostly just concerned because if I\u2019m not mistaken, we have until May 15 to either accept or deny our admission. Any help would be appreciated.",

If ur friend is also international, it is better to contact the international office rather than the general admission email.",

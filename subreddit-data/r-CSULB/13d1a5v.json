Which I believe to be so unfair I even emailed them asking why and they said because the application was distance based rather than first come first serve but I live in a toxic household the whole point of me choosing to dorm is so I could better my situation. What am I supposed to do?!",

By May 1st, the 2600 students at the greatest distance from campus with completed applications and paid service fee will receive housing priority. After the initial capacity is met, those remaining will be placed on a waitlist based upon date of application.",

    "postText": "If a program requires all prerequisites to be done before applying, does that mean you miss a semester of college? I'm trying to plan out my pre-reqs in order to transfer from a CC to the CSULB School of Nursing. They said that it is not allowed to have any classes in progress when applying and that all prerequisites must be completed. Does that mean if I apply for the spring 2025 semester, I will just have a gap during the fall 2024 semester since I should hav all my pre-reqs done before applying? I'm a freshman next year and I'm a bit confused so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

So in the spring semester I will be taking CSU graduation requirements and other co-requisites for the nursing programs I am interested in. I feel like it is a good way of making use of time and getting those classes out of the way!",

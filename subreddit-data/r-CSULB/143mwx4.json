Enroll in CC\u2019s with figure drawing courses over summer/winter breaks, heck take em during fall and spring (it\u2019s not like you need to pass them). The other option is just attending figure drawing sessions.\n\nThe more time you spend life drawing will aid your pre-pro skills a lot. Other than that, just visit your counselors to make sure you\u2019re on track in the event you feel like you\u2019re taking the wrong courses.",

Either they are tyrannical and enjoy failing students (50%), don\u2019t care about their students at all and put in zero effort (25%), are incredibly out of touch and haven\u2019t worked in industry since prehistoric times (15%), or a combination of all of the above in varying degrees. The last 10% are amazing and I feel lucky to have taken their courses. They are extremely intelligent, compassionate, and at the top of their field. \n\nMost of the time, when you are choosing your upcoming schedule, you will have to choose between a professor who has a 1.2/5 on RMP where you will probably fail, or a professor who has a 4/5 because they don\u2019t give a single f, teach nothing, and then just pass everyone at the end. \n\nTo prepare, I\u2019d say research who the profs are that you\u2019d actually learn from and take their courses. Other than that, you\u2019re probably gonna have to rely on outside sources, such as your personal study group, tutoring, YouTube, friends, etc. I wish I had known this before I started coming here, so hopefully I can help someone else out :)",

CSULB is still a great school for engineering because of its location, connections, reputation, etc. \n\nIf you are a student who is prepared to teach themselves the entire course outside of class and heavily rely on your support network, then you\u2019ll do just fine at CSULB. \n\nI\u2019d compare the rate my professor reviews of ME profs at both schools and see who averages better.",

I know a handful of people without internships or job offers.\n\nHowever, the opportunities are there if you go and get it. Have a friend interning at JPL. The other day (or was it today?) Northrup Grumman had an event for their accepted CSULB interns (there was prob 20-30 CSULB students at the event, meaning 20-30 CSULB students are interning with NG this summer). I'll be interning at a large EV company this summer.",

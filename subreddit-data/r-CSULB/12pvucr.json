    "postText": "Just placed on the waiting list and freaking out.\n\nI am honestly so scared about the whole dorming situation. Only 600 returning students can dorm this upcoming semester???\nI don\u2019t know what do about this. I rely on dorming to keep attending classes here and I live way too far where if I were to take public transport, it would take two hours to get here. If I can\u2019t dorm, I can\u2019t attend classes. I feel like there is nothing I can do. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m not ready to get my own apartment, yet the college just expects us to figure it out. Any suggestions? \nI saw Cal Poly Humboldt was having the same issue where so many students are expected to be displaced to make way for freshman.",

I\u2019m lucky enough where I believe I will be able to finish my degree with just online classes (although I don\u2019t want to jinx it), but I feel for the others not in the same position.\n\nI hope you can at least take solace in the fact your aren\u2019t alone.",

As demand increased, the school did build more dorms (Parkside North), but I don\u2019t think anyone commenting realizes how difficult it is to just build or acquire more housing as demand changed rapidly. \n\nMy advice is to not depend on the university for any of your needs. Administration is not going to bend over backwards to help students, and once you\u2019re out of school, your employer likely isn\u2019t going to help you with living arrangements either. You say you\u2019re not ready to get an apartment? Well, you might need to get ready if on-campus housing doesn\u2019t pan out. Find some friends in the dorms in a similar situation and start looking at what apartments are out there. If you wait on housing to determine what your plans are, you likely won\u2019t have time to make other arrangements.",

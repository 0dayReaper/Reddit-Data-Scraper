Even non-theatre majors?\n\nI heard from my THEA 113 teacher that there was a musical theatre class and I\u2019ve always liked musical theatre but never actually participated in it myself, so why not start now if I can \ud83e\udd37 I\u2019m just hoping it\u2019s open to beginners \ud83d\ude05\n\nI\u2019ve tried looking into it and I think it\u2019s THEA 490 but I\u2019m not entirely sure, and it says that \u201cdepartment consent required\u201d.\n\nAny info helps!",

Unless you've got singing or acting chops developed already, it's unlikely you'll get in. There's very likely auditions required, and you'll be competing with folks in-major.\n\nThat all being said, there's no harm in asking! Write the dept. head and see what they say. There may even be a cross-disciplinary option for you.\n\nGood luck!",

I currently live in DTLA and the more I read about dorming, the more I think it may be overrated and I would just rather deal with the traffic. So now I'm thinking if I do plan on commuting, I should treat myself to a tesla to sorta enjoy my driving experience to and from school. Should I just stay on the waitlist or buy myself a tesla to enjoy my commute?",

The hesitation of moving is that I won't find a better deal than what I currently have. \nMy mom is retired and does not work, my brother and I support her but we have a 4 bedroom apartment in Westlake and only pay 1300. The location ain't the best but you can't beat that price for 4bd/2 bath. \n\nWith rent not being so high that's why it made sense for me to splurge on a Tesla if I'm gonna be driving to CSULB.",

I don\u2019t think youll make very many friends from a networking standpoint by staying in the dorms, not many who will be close in age range\u2026everyone is 18-20. \n\nDormers can\u2019t drink yet so it feels like they\u2019re still children. You can network from classes, no need to pay dorm rent &amp; Your living situation with your family sounds great, so don\u2019t i wouldn\u2019t give that up to pursue a silly material item and two years of potentially \u201cnetworking\u201c with a bunch of 18 year olds.\n\nHang in there. Your time at CSULB is going to fly by, I say do your best to save as much as you can right now. Your rent price is ridiculously low, even for the US in general\u2026 so if you move or dorm you will be paying atleast double for just yourself. \n\n**Of course, no matter what do what makes you happiest!**",

            "comment": "Just to clarify, youre not in school yet and you\u2019re leaning towards buying a really expensive vehicle over securing your living situation?   \n\n\nThis is my opinion, but right now CSULB should be your number 1 concern. Get your life situation figured out first, where will you be living? If you don\u2019t know, you shouldn\u2019t be worried about a  car yet. Save the luxury vehicle as post-graduation gift for all the hard work you\u2019re about to do.\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is why I think this way: In all scenarios, unless you have a built in Tesla charger in your dorm lot, charging the battery *will* be another added expense and possible stressor for you, especially if you don\u2019t have an affordable place to stay. Charging the battery takes more time than you\u2019d expect, that time adds up through the week, and chargers are also getting harder to find these days, people will sit and work and puppy-guard the charges for 5+ hours sometimes!  I\u2019ve had to go out of my way to *drive to other cities* to find less popular chargers to charge mine and there have been times were I was unable to get an open charger, so ultra realistically, I see time being a serious consideration for you aside from the money aspect. &amp; Time *is* money so you\u2019re not saving that much by getting a Tesla.  I would argue that the issues it creates will take away some of your freedom of autonomy, &amp; definitely your time.  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about having a place to live for the semester, passing classes will be challenging. Get your living situation right first before splurging on unnecessary luxury items\u2026 **the commute will still suck in a nice car too**. Plus, there are a lot more financially \u2018healthier\u2019 things you can do to enjoy your commute, like podcasts, meditations, listening to audio recordings of your lessons, get a coffee or breakfast on the way, etc. Commute is still a commute, even in a Tesla. \n\nI say, why not meet in the middle. Rent a more affordable place off-campus with other students, and pick out a more affordable mid-range hybrid or electric vehicle? You would have it all. More time, more money, and less stress. Fun commute in a car thats new to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d be rich with time, sleeping in on campus, possibly happy, eating with my friends. Instead of commuting daily, likely stressed out from traffic and my car payment, just to be in a silly Tesla that I have to fight someone to charge the battery, any day of the week. Just my perspective. \n\nSounds like a debate of aesthetics over function. Why are you here? School Or to drive a Tesla?",

Can you afford this for that long, if your job that stable. Is the degree your pursuing in college that profitable and easy to get hired. Everyone just looks at the god damn monthly payments but that\u2019s only part of it. Look at total cost look at the cost vs reward your gonna get. TBH idk how you expect to save 10k a year that would mean your spending like 175$ on gas a week. There is no way that realistic. I get there\u2019s rebates/ tax credits but those are for any electric car not just a Tesla. Consider a Chevy volt or Nissan leaf. Sure it\u2019s not a cool car, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot more in your price range. Buy a Tesla when your making over 6 figures.",

Although it'll be a nice shiny toy for me I'm sure it'll only stress me out more working enough to pay it off and also maintain my grades at school. \n\nI don't need a car as my Altima is at 120k miles and has plenty left. I think I really considered buying a Tesla after I joked with my mom that I will buy one and she said I can give my car to her since she currently doesn't have one and only gets around when my brother or I are not working. \n\nI've also been working on my credit and pay roughly 800-1000 a month lately to keep my account balances low and boost my credit even more to get the best deals later. So I simply thought if I'm paying this much on credit card bills and have my accounts paid off by the end of the year, it made sense for me to pay a little less than 800 a month for a Tesla since the economy is catering towards eco-friendly cars so I wouldn't be surprised if more incentives are introduced in the coming years.",

You're a college student, so it's ok to struggle and not have anything flashy. Since your credit card debt is running 800-1000 a month, definitely make that the priority to pay it off ASAP. 20-30% interest when you got that much to pay as a student each month is wild. Makes me wonder  how much is your overall debt? \n\nYou got bigger fish to fry than even thinking about adding a car loan, let alone your college debt. Seriously get ahead of this debt, because I have friends who in our 30's still paying off their student loans at $1000+/month. \n\nI understand going to CSULB &gt; CSULA in terms of overall amenities, but honestly nobody in the professional world nobody cares where you got your bachelor's from. The consensus is nobody learned shit during undergrad. It matters more once you get your masters. To solve this car heartache and traffic, why not go to CSULA? You would be saving a massive amount of time and money for your everyday life. \n\n If your mom doesn't work, it sounds like you would be paying for more when you end up giving her a car, like repairs/insurance/gas.",

Cars are a huge distraction on the financial end when you're not there yet. Making 70k in LA is entry level salary at best, which means you've got much more leveling up to do financially. \n\nIf you're asking /r/CSULB about buying a Tesla or Dorm (when you're 30!!) to a majority of 17-23 yr old full-time students who maybe work part-time, then it seems like you've got a lot more to learn. Ask the same exact question on /r/personalfinance. Also, watch Caleb Hammer's YouTube on financial literacy and humble yourself bro. Honestly you could be a candidate for his show. \n\nI'm 32, 7 yr CSULB alum, SO and I make 350k total and are looking to rent out our first home to pay for our 2nd, largely because we eliminated our car, credit, and student debt. There's a path to increase your net worth, but it starts with decisions like these that may set you back years and possibly decades if your mindset doesn't change. And it certainly doesn't start with being entitled to a Tesla because you're 30. Tough love from 49er to 49er. Hope you make the right decision.",

I drive a 2022 X5 which is a bigger suv and gas isn\u2019t really killing me either, nor has it ever been hit at school. Although, I do see people with nicer cars cramming themselves into small spaces to park closer, which explains why everyone says your car will get hit, simple fix just park a bit further or in corner spots. \nAnd don\u2019t listen to financial advice from other college students. Everyone will either be shaming you for buying something they don\u2019t want (can\u2019t afford) or make you feel guilty for buying that thing they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d lol.

At your income, throwing $40k+ down on a car is not a good financial move.\n\nAlso - FWIW Teslas are unbelievably overrated. Other makes have much better / more capable \u201cautopilot\u201d features, quality control sucks, the cars are arguably worse than they were a couple of years ago since Tesla deleted a bunch of sensors\u2026.I\u2019ll spare you the rant.

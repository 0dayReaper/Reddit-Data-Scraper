When I returned, I got a job working as a Neurofeedback and EEG technician for $30 / hour--as an independent contractor, it's more of a technical job that may require getting an additional certification. I suggest looking into things like that! \n\nOtherwise, if you're more into the clinical side of things I would also suggest searching for a Research Assistant for clinical trials.",

Other than that entry level jobs looking for BAs are all open to you.",

Ideally you\u2019d get exactly the job you want as the first job, but sometimes it\u2019ll take 1-3 jobs, or stepping stones if you will, to get there. \n\n\nFor example, the first stepping stone can be any job in a business environment, \u201ccoordinator\u201d type jobs, or admin work. $20-$30/hr. So obviously you have to apply to these jobs, work on your resume and interview skills. Generally, if you\u2019re hard working and can sell yourself well, these jobs have a low barrier to entry. Also most of the people I knew in this role had unrelated backgrounds (English major, music major, bio major, etc.) Business majors skip this step and go to the next one directly after graduating.\n\nNext job entry level HR, payroll, recruiting, etc. This could be at a small no name company doing all HR aspects, or a bigger company just focusing on one part of HR. $25-$35/hr. At this point, it\u2019s a good idea to get some certifications as well. There\u2019s a bunch in HR depending where you wanna go.\n\nNext, you\u2019d switch jobs or get a promotion. Better company or more senior role, with increasing responsibilities. $30-$45/hr.\n\nNext job is same deal, more seniority and responsibilities. $40-$50+, $100k++.\n\nEach stepping stone/job you can plan to spend anywhere from 1-3 years before moving to the next step.",

            "comment": "I went to both schools. If they were both exactly the same price, I would lean slightly towards UCR. I think CSULB and UCR are both decent schools, but it really depends what you're looking for.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoyed Riverside, but I never went out much and mostly stayed on campus. That said, Big Bear (snow board/ski or just party with friends) and Vegas is quite a bit closer. At UCR people go to Vegas pretty often whenever there is a rave or end of the quarter. There's some hiking in Riverside which is nice, and kind of fun if you like road biking as there are mountains around. Downtown Riverside is not bad and has a historical side and some new development. Food in Riverside is not good compared to CSULB, not many options, and the options are not very good. The dorms/meal plans are top notch. UCR campus imo is way nicer than LB, and the libraries are way way better. UCR gyms, recreation areas (like pool table, ping pong, etc.), and equipment loans (you can borrow a laptop from most buildings/libraries) are way better. Rent at UCR on and off campus is good price. Personally, I really recommend living on campus at the apartments. Riverside is pretty hot in the summer, but you're gonna be indoors 99% of the time so it's nbd. All the buildings/rooms have good AC. Research at UCR is top-tier. \n\nCSULB is close to the beach and aquarium, and a bunch of other stuff. Any food you want is not too far away. CSULB nickel and dimes you for absolutely everything (but tuition + fees are way cheaper). For ex the student union charges to play pool, video games, bowling, ping pong, etc. lmao. It's all free (included in tuition obviously) at UCR. Rent in LB is gonna cost and arm and a leg. Some buildings at LB don't have AC, and you're gonna sweat. there's been cases of people fainting in the art building (there's been protests about this last summer lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInternships probably better in/around LB just due to the number of options, and you won't have to move. Career prospects for marketing/business, I feel like they would be the same imo... LB might be better just due to proximity? There's prob at least 100x more jobs around LB/LA than Riverside/Inland Empire. But I had a lot of friends at UCR intern at big companies in/around Orange County area, as well as end up in Big 4/related companies.\n\nLB also has a really cool entrepreneurship program/incubator if you're into that.",

You'll definitely like what the city has to offer as opposed to the dreadful inland empire. It's so miserable.\n\nFor housing, I think you should hop on the CSULB facebook roommate finder page. There are always tons of people looking to fill rooms or rent places with.",

            "comment": "I had this same situation, marketing major as well. I chose LB &amp; I am so happy I did, the city overall in my opinion is 100x better than Riverside... our school is also much more open &amp; nice vs riverside which I felt it was boring and dull. Riverside itself is just boring, there is not much to do besides maybe downtown riverside (over 21) &amp; the mission inn during christmas time.The marketing program here is good, the professors overall aren't bad at all. I would talk to UCR about them switching your major if you end up going with them, as econ is pretty different than marketing atleast from the classes I've taken. There is an internship class for marketing majors as of last semester, and I always get emails for opportunities from the college of business for internships! Not that this really matters either, but the parking lot is right by the business building so it's an easy walk if you drive, people complain a lot about the walk here but it's easy for business majors. RGo with the option that won't have you stressing a lot financially, as both schools are a good choice. Hope this helps &amp; let me know if u have any other questions (:",

That being said, if you aren't from southern California and you've determined that both institutions meet your academic requirements, I would suggest researching both cities and choosing based of where you want to live. I would be shocked if anyone recommends living in Riverside over Long Beach. I spent my entire life in southern California and most people avoid Riverside if they can (depends mostly on their jobs). Of course there is stuff to do but I don't think it compares to Long Beach. Your mileage may very, nobody on this subreddit knows anything about you so maybe you're more accustomed to life in Riverside.\n\nAlso if you are going for a degree in marketing and you are set on it, you might find that being near cities like Irvine, LA, the south bay, greater orange county, will offer you more opportunities (you mentioned internships). Riverside isn't particularly well-known for it's business ventures when compared to the LA area and orange county. Of course, your mileage may vary.\n\nMaybe visit the towns.",

I would take a UC over the[CSU anyday](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/12oymd7/campus_life/jgm1fr8/?context=3) (except for merced) It's better funded, the resources and facilities in the school are better, the faculty are better (seriously, they only hire old retired lecturers at a CSU whereas a UC has a higher number of full time faculty who aren't juggling 3 different campuses). Now riverside itself is a shithole (not as bad a merced), but if you live around the school there are a ton of students who also live there and you'll have an overall better vibe because students actually hang around there. As opposed to long beach where you would be hanging around 40 year old investorbro types on 2nd street, actual hood on the west side, and homeless in downtown.",

    "postText": "I feel so lost in life knowing that I am going to be on my fourth year. Looking at LinkedIn is making me depressed. I'm just worried about my future. My goal is to get an internship for the fall but I feel so unexperienced to get it.   \n\n\nI have a google cert (which i doubt that means much) and I am planning to make a dashboard this summer to showcase my tableau skills. I don't know what else I can do to.  So far I'm looking for anything with analyst, BI, or project management role. Let me know if there are other roles I should take into account.   \n\n\nAlso, another thing is I am not prepared for interviews as I have never done mock interviews. Any help is appreciated because I don't have many business friends so I feel like I am on my own for most of the time which makes it difficult for me. I am in clubs but their meeting times always conflict with my class times each semester.  I would really love to have an internship for the fall so please help me.",

My life was unfair and I was on the brink of suicide\n\nOne year later, my social skill have gotten way better and I am no longer shy, I have made a lot of friends, I educated myself and know way more, I started my fitness journey and lost over 50 pounds, And I feel like this is going to be the best year of my life\n\nMy advice is to just do it. It is that easy. Ignore your feelings for just a bit and get uncomfortable. Focus on yourself and become better than you were yesterday. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that you are scared of what people will think of you, than ignore your feelings and do what you have been wanting to do. You will thank yourself.\n\nSorry for the long lecture and hopefully you found this helpful",

            "comment": "Don't worry... we have all been there.  You have to start from somewhere.  The best thing you can do is to start networking immediately.  You don't need practice or experience, just jump right in and start marketing yourself.\n\nSign up for campus clubs (especially those that are associated with an outside business or industry organization), conferences, seminars, symposiums, summer research projects, poster/speech competitions, job fairs, tours, etc. that are often sponsored by neighboring universities and local employers who may be scouting for interns.  Talk to your professors and ask if there are any upcoming opportunities.  Most departments have a calendar of events, and bulletin boards that contain lists of upcoming opportunities.  \n\nVisit other departments that have complementary areas of interest (Colleges of Business, Engineering etc.) Consider participating in their campus clubs, conferences, seminars, symposiums, etc...  Next, visit other neighboring colleges &amp; universities, check out their websites, check our their department calendars, talk to their professors, etc.  \n\nStart planning now to attend as many of these events as possible.  Come prepared to each event:  dress sharp, smell nice, get a haircut and **please shave** if applicable, bring plenty of resumes, work samples, letters of recommendation, and don't forget a warm smile and handshake for every person you meet.\n\nIf you make a solid effort to do all of the things above, it's practically impossible (even in a recession!) to not end up with several options for internship.  Remember, as you transition from academic life to your career this same rule will continue to hold true:  \n\nFailure to plan = planning to fail.",

For this upcoming semester I'm planning to join FMA and AMA! Previously I attended meet the firms expo but I honestly did not benefit much from it because most of the recruiters are meant for mgmt, finance, accounting. I always feel like IS is the most neglected out of the concentrations of business admin (which is why i feel like im on my own).   \n\n\nas for resume, i asked my professor previously if they can check mine and made some tweaks to it. I still don't think it is good. is it ok if i can send you my resume and you can check it out?",

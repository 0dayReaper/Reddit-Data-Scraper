I accepted the admission offer but now I\u2019m wondering if I should withdraw my admission and stick to Community College and then transfer instead. Is there anything in the LB Pre-nursing program that would make it worth it to stay on that track or is Community College the better option? I keep going back and forth between the two so any help or advice would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "There was another post about this recently if you search the sub for more info! As someone who went to CSULB SON I definitely recommend the community college route and then transferring. That\u2019s what me and many of my peers in my cohort did. It saves you a TON of money. I was able to split my classes between Fullerton and Cypress as they are sister schools and I was always able to get into the classes I needed between the two. \n\nMy other advice is to make sure you do very well in your science classes (most of us maintained 4.0 in all of our science courses) and then obviously try to get As in the rest as well. It\u2019s extremely competitive but it\u2019s a great program. \n\nAnother word of advice would be to start practicing for your TEAs exam as they will use that score when making admission decisions to the SON. Good luck!",

From my knowledge it\u2019s strictly grades, heavy on the science and then TEAs scores. I didn\u2019t do any extracurricular and got in. I think if you do them, you can add that but my main focus would just be on grades.",

It\u2019s one of the best choices you can make financially and for your education. You gives you the chance to explore other career choice as well to see if you like nursing as well. Get involved at your community college, i would suggest working on campus it\u2019s fun you get to know faculty and other students.",

            "comment": "Hi there, literally in the same position as you from a year ago, (you can look at my post history). I got accepted as a pre-nursing too (but no honors). I\u2019ll give try my best to some insight to how my first year went to the best of my abilities\n\nI think it depends where you are in life right now, and how well you\u2019re able to adjust and hold yourself accountable now that college requires you to be a LOT more disciplined. \n\nWhen I accepted my CSULB admission I was already burnt out from high school and frankly was in the lowest part of my life, this really seeped into my academic\u2019s especially in this semester. I was the type of person that never really studied in high school, I always got straight A\u2019s because everything was relatively easy that I never really had to try. This meant that I never formed any good study habits which really set me for failure my first year. I found that transition extremely difficult, (still do) it felt overwhelming because things moved at a much faster pace and I didn\u2019t have any sort of tools/habits to fall back on.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this to scare you (or anyone reading!) just remember everyone\u2019s experience is going to be different. What might have been an unproductive/horrible first year for someone could mean an academically and even socially fulfilling year for another person! Reflect exactly where you are right now both physically and mentally. Are you staying at home? If so, are your parents strict? chill? supportive? Are you dorming? If so, are you going to be able to keep yourself accountable and not forget your priorities? \n\nJust remember sometimes things might not be as bad as it seems. I know it sounds like I had a real shit time here at CSULB, but really it wasn\u2019t horrible. Despite my grades being a shitshow (ahem excuse my language) this year attending this school allowed me to discover a lot of things about myself and met some really great people, (even professors)! and fyi Patrick Pierce, the CHEM 140 prof isn\u2019t that bad as some people portray him). I didn\u2019t do great in his class but I can acknowledge that he does want everyone to succeed!\n\n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong decision, the goal is just to graduate in nursing. I hope this can help a bit, I\u2019m not giving you a straight answer because that\u2019s for you to decide, I just wanted to give some background to how MY year went. I don\u2019t regret going to CSULB, I just regret not picking up my slack in order to do better in my classes.",

Even though CC is a great option if you\u2019re dead poor and don\u2019t want to pay for college debt Long term, you still have to live with the fact that you have nobody around you to build real relations with in those 4 years which will last you a lifetime. In all honesty, if you can foot the incredibly reasonable bill LB costs for 4 years with a few scholarships here and there, I\u2019d do it and make the most of it. CC are 2 lonely long years, and I\u2019d only recommend doing it if you have a friend group that\u2019s also doing it, or financially extremely restricted.",

I\u2019m going into my fifth, and hopefully final year, majoring in Food Science with a minor in Japanese. \n\nSome things about me:\n* I don\u2019t smoke and don\u2019t really drink alcohol. \n* I usually go to bed around 10pm-midnight. \n* I go to the gym fairly early in the morning (wake up around 6am). \n* I\u2019m a pretty introverted so I usually don\u2019t really have people come over to my room (during the previous times I\u2019ve dormed)\n* Also, I\u2019m not really one to start a conversation, so if I seem really quiet, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t like you, it just because I\u2019m shy!!\n* That said, I would prefer if the noise level in the room is pretty low (headphones, not playing anything outloud unless discussed), but I don\u2019t mind the occasional chats/conversations between us roommates. \n* I\u2019m a pretty tidy person and would appreciate who is the same (doesn\u2019t leave clothes all over the floor, doesn\u2019t leave the sink/shower a mess after using it, cleans up after themselves when eating in the room, etc.)\n* To the point above, I\u2019m trying to dorm in a double room at Beachside. \n* I\u2019m a dude who watches anime and enjoys gaming (although I tend to just watch people on Youtube play games rather than playing them myself, weird yea)\n\nAll in all, these are the points we lived by with my previous roommates and we got along just fine. As long as your clean, shower frequently, and respect boundaries/rules we agree upon, it\u2019ll be a chill semester, so HMU if interested of have any questions!!",

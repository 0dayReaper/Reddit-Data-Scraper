They\u2019re federally funded research opportunities over the summer that look amazing on a resume. However I know most internships had deadlines in January-March, so consider that if applying for next summer. I feel like it might be hard to find open internships now as it\u2019s pretty close to summer, so maybe look into volunteering opportunities in local companies/orgs. Ask your professors and classmates their previous experience and what they\u2019re doing this summer as well. Hope you find something!",

Spring's already event already happened, but it's definitely a great opportunity to meet professionals in the field and put your name out there.",

Also check out CSULB\u2019s LBCIP internship program if you\u2019re interested in non-profit and community organizations.",

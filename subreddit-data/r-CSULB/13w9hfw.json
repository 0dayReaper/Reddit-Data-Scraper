I\u2019ve never actually used financial aid before, since I\u2019ve had other methods of paying for my classes. Does anyone know how much the cost is for attendance?? I see loans in my financial aid package, does that mean I have to pay; I\u2019m kinda confused on if I\u2019ll be receiving any distributions, and will this be enough to cover tuition. Thank you :)",

A lot of factors can play into that, like EFC, family income/household size, GPA, Parents\u2019 Educational Level, etc. This is their words and standards, not stuff I made up. I had to spam them with calls to get answers.\n\nThey continue to assign me a high EFC when my parents have contributed nothing to my schooling. Ive paid out of pocket for everything because I worked constantly, and still pay for it myself. Ive also filed independently on my taxes since 18, but they only consider me dependent because I\u2019m under 25. They take my assets into consideration of course, but not the 7 years of scraping by to accumulate them; the way they process the info is broken if you ask me, but of course Im going to feel that way. Im far from the only one to think it is BS either. A lot of people that get rejected from any of these grants are far from rich lol",

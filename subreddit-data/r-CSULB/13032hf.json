You finish almost 6 months earlier and can get a head start taking your NCLEX, starting your career, etc. A lot of my classmates chose semester however because financial aid didn\u2019t cover the summer and so they needed to work to pay for tuition. It used to be more lucrative to choose trimester though because Long Beach Memorial used to pretty much guarantee a job to trimester students but that is no longer the case. \n\nI will say trimester clinical professors are tougher than semester ones. Trimester clinical professors work for the medical center and semester ones work for CSULB. My professors expected a lot but I definitely learned a lot.",

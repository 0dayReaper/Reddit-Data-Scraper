No matter where you are on campus, you\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw away from an available outlet and a desk near it with a chair. Empty classrooms, the library (all 5 floors but honestly; the second floor grad center has the comfiest chairs), the conference rooms and entire first floor of the student Union building,the Chakaryan center (spelled wrong but it\u2019s how you pronounce it), if you\u2019re looking for one, you will find it. Great resource as well: front desk staff of the various centers. Ask and ye shall receive from the well of info",

There is also the sticks lounge in the USU that usually has outlets, as well as the Horn Center. You could even duck into unoccupied classrooms or slip into classes that interest you that also have wall outlets.",

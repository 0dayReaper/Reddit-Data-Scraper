Firing Conoley isn\u2019t gonna solve any actual problems.\n\nFor one thing, from the link one of you shared (and apparently didn\u2019t read):\n\n&gt;Carbaugh said that the home, which was built in 1965, had its heat and air conditioning system was repaired, and the roof was replaced. She also said that it was refurbished with a seismic upgrade and an electrical panel.\n\n&gt;\u201cThis has been scheduled now for more than a year,\u201d Carbaugh said. **\u201cSo, it predates President Conoley\u2026\u201d**\n\nSecond, Conoley doesn\u2019t get paid more than the POTUS, that\u2019s a ridiculous claim. The President gets paid probably two orders of magnitude more in perks in addition to base salary. We also have zero idea what she actually donates or doesn\u2019t donate with her salary and frankly it\u2019s none of our business.\n\nThird, she doesn\u2019t live in a \u201cmansion\u201d. It\u2019s a 3-bed, 4-bath house operated by CSULB. It\u2019s pretty big by area but not way more so than most other large-ish houses in the area.\n\nFourth, adding A/C to **any** building built in 1949 without original design intent is a big undertaking. Not even considering the bureaucratic nightmare that is CA public education, you need God-knows-how-many city permits, there needs to be enough space for the compressor + fan assemblies (which are *huge* for large buildings) to even get permits, there might not be space for ducting, and even if there were, structural work might need to be done which requires even more permits. So it\u2019s not like a weekend project, and those buildings might (probably, actually) need a complete tear down / rebuild. For perspective getting a city permit to operate solar panels on my house took almost 6 months.\n\nI feel for the art building students (in fact, I had a couple of classes in there, so I get it). But since I started at CSULB in 2013 the school has spent *a ton* of money completely renovating a ton of buildings, parking structures, lots, solar, etc etc. So it\u2019s not as if money isn\u2019t being spent improving the school, it\u2019s just that they have to prioritize improvement funding somehow and still have enough space for classes.",

But they can\u2019t do all of them at once, and because of that, someone\u2019s gonna lose out in terms of timing.  As I pointed out other places on this sub, half of the fine arts, buildings were already scheduled to be renovated over the next few years. It just sucks that they weren\u2019t higher up in the queue but if not them, some other dept would have been stuck at the back of the line.",

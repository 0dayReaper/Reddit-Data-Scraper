            "comment": "I have taken him, his class is pretty simple, the projects aren\u2019t too complicated, and if I am remember correctly, you can do his projects in groups now. \n\nHis exams are reasonable and he quizzes a lot, but you get three attempts. His exams were very similar to the quizzes in terms of content, things may be reworded but it was not bad if you knew a little about what he was asking. \n\nHe\u2019s also very knowledgeable and a great professor overall, I really enjoyed his lectures and class. \n\nHowever, he was a bit of a lazy grader, in terms of time, but that wasn\u2019t so bad.",

To apply to CSULB, visit Cal State Apply. Once submitted, we will send you a notification by email to acknowledge receipt of your application. Students may only be considered for one application per academic term. \n\n[Citation here](https://www.csulb.edu/admissions/first-time-first-year-student-application-process).\n\n~~also if you have free time/money consider doing concurrent enrollment at a local community college over summer lol, i'm looking at csulb's dataset for 2015-2022 admissions from the Institution of Research and Analytics and ftfy with transfer GPAs are accepted much more~~  \noh you're already doing it lol  \n\nif you want to hyperoptimize, [Assist](https://assist.org/) lists all of the current transfer/igetc contracts in one area so you can snipe lower-div courses before stepping onto a university campus. there's a couple catches, namely time and cost, but also taking too many GEs too quickly means you'll have to find other filler classes later on that are mainly for units instead of fulfilling a GE simultaneously, but this may not be a problem for you",

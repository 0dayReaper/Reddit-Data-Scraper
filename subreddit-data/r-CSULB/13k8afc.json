    "postText": "President Connelly and the CSULB leadership, shame on you for putting your comfort and needs above acknowledging the sacrifice and hard work of working class families.  You showed your heart when you publicly stated that \u201cattending 12 ceremony\u2019s was a tiring thing\u201d.  Please resign. Your leadership is not about making the world a better place, not about training the next generation of leaders.  Your leadership is about doing the minimum and your own comfort.  \n\nBackground\nI graduated \u201cThe Beach\u201d in 80s with a BSEE.  I walked in our graduation ceremony.  \n\nI attended the graduation ceremony for my daughter.  I was very disappointed at the lack of decorum by the CSULB leadership.  So much so that when president Donnelly gave her speech, I stood and showed her my back.  \n\nWhere\u2019s your heart?\nThe CSULB leadership team entered after the students.  I saw only one CSULB professor congratulating students post ceremony.  The CSULB master of ceremony ended not with a congratulatory cheer, but with a request to join the alumni association.  (Well that\u2019s when I turned off listening)\n\nMy mom and dad sacrificed much to send me to school.  We sacrificed for my daughter to go to school.  I shed a tear as she entered the stadium.  I\u2019m crying as I write this now.\n\nUnder your leadership, you\u2019ve turned a great teaching institution to a do the minimum.  You couldn\u2019t even make a printed apology for your inappropriate statements.  Please resign.",

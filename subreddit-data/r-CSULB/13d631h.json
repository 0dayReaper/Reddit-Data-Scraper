            "comment": "TL;DR\n\nMitali Jain, a nutrition major entering her senior year, has been involved in student government since her earlier years at the university. She aims to increase student awareness of ASI's resources and gather more student feedback on their needs. Jain also intends to collaborate with student orientation, advising, and registration to help incoming first-year students understand the benefits and services provided by ASI.  \nAdditionally, Jain has specific goals, such as implementing a pilot program to distribute free TAP cards for the Long Beach transit system. As the vice president of finance, she has a significant say in the ASI budget for the next fiscal year and plans to create more opportunities for students to work part-time within ASI's various departments.  \nJain and the outgoing president, Isaac Julian, will be holding transition meetings following the conclusion of the semester. Jain hopes to engage with students by attending the Week of Welcome at the beginning of the fall semester and introducing herself to student organizations and the student body, aiming to establish open lines of communication.",

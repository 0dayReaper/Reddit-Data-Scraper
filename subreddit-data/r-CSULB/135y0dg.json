    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all. I need to know what y\u2019all think about people that go sit at your table or booth without asking??! I\u2019ve had this happen twice to me already. But today I left my little table I was sitting at to go use the restroom and when I came back, a person was sitting there despite all my stuff being on the table and backpack!?! And it wasn\u2019t a huge table to share either it was one of those small circle tables for two max! And I was saving the seat for someone too. I just find it kind of rude especially when they refuse to even look at you after they just sit down and take up your space. Idk if it\u2019s just me overreacting but I want to know if anyone else has had this happen and how y\u2019all handle it. Thanks",

Once I needed a particular seat in a library and I asked if the person occupying that table minded. They said no so i sat there comfortably doing my work. \n\nI think it\u2019s just basic human etiquette?",

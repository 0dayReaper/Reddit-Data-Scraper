And why mans didn't request that too, and just hangback in the parking lot instead of needing to walk in with the cop once he realized he's in this pointlessly odd situation? \n\nI honestly don't think this is a race thing, I just think everyone made wrong choices",

It is common for faculty to be on campus on weekends. If he lost his ID on a trip he just came back from, how could he get a replacement if he needed to be on campus and the ID desk is closed? I see all these arguments about how the cop was just doing his job, but no one calls the Dean when they\u2019re locked out of a fucking office. That\u2019s not protocol. And I believe that this faculty member didn\u2019t have the number because no one is going to have the Dean\u2019s personal number except maybe those that work close to them. I\u2019m faculty and was a staff member for a decade and this response by campus police is bullshit.",

            "comment": "This is sus for sure, but it is somewhat how I was treated in the same situation.\n\nI locked myself out of my office once, not the building. Same situation. Had my phone on me. They do ask for ID, full name, and department on the call. I provided all of that.\n\nMy keys were sitting on my desk and my ID was in my backpack in my desk drawer. I told them where everything was in my office, described it all. They opened the door and made me wait while they walked in and checked everything out. I immediately went to my desk drawer, pulled out my backpack, and produced my ID.\n\nThe prof admitted to not having identification, so this could be problematic, but the dean part is super sus. They should ask for department or chair or department office manager. We don\u2019t bother deans with getting locked out or verifying identity. The officer could have asked for more details. He could have walked in and checked out the situation first. There were so many ways to be more helpful and verify the professor\u2019s identity. \n\nNot how things should be handled as a campus community. The prof was stuck with no phone, keys, and no way to gain access to those items to remedy the situation. Plus, his office was left open with student information accessible to anyone who walked right in. This is a FERPA violation.",

It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s a professor, he just can\u2019t be responsible for anything. He knows the policies, and his supervisor confirmed.

From the video, it seems like it wouldn't even matter if he went to Campus PD office, since the officer told him to go home and call his Dean as the only solution, meaning there was nothing Campus PD could nor would do without his staff id. Also, he didn't call the police. Because his phone is locked in his office... It is Campus PD that is in plain sight on school campus. I am not a cop hater either. It's just that the prof has no keys, phone, or id, and is pretty much shit outta luck, when all it takes is two grown men agreeing on a simple solution to verify this guys ID without snitching to his supervisor.\n\nEdit: And to add to my point why I said there are times for discretion, sometimes we as humans complicate simple things. If we went by the book in literally every situation in life, the world would be just one big DMV.",

A few hours later he came back and the security guy let him in recognizing him as a teacher. The guy came back with a gun and shot some of the staff. If you don't have an ID or deans verification then you shouldn't be let in. \n\nGranted I don't think this was the case. I assume the guy is genuine, but it's just not something to risk as a cop. Especially when police agencies review bodycam footage. The guy coulda been fired if he broke protocol and let this guy in, or even went into the office to verify his story. Especially after his supervisor told him no. It's just not something to risk your job over. And throwing out the race card is just pretty obnoxious for the professor to do",

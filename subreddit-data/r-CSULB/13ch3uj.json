    "postText": "Hi guys\nI honestly don\u2019t post much on Reddit but I just need some advice. I\u2019m taking a communications course at CSULB and I\u2019ve turned in every single assignment with my lowest average being an 80% in the categories for the course. Which has kept my grade at a solid A all semester. Two weeks ago we had a video submission on canvas that was due on the 26th at 3pm (Who makes assignments due at 3pm?) I am a working student, I work two jobs and support myself financially through college since I moved to socal all on my own once I transferred in less than two years ago. So, I had work that day at 12pm and I recorded my 90 second video assignment and uploaded it at 11 am. I was actually late because it was taking a while to upload. Fast forward to that Saturday the 29th, my professor sent out a direct message on canvas saying the drop box was opened to students who didn\u2019t submit their video assignment from 9am-3pm. However, in my mind I submitted the assignment because I never got an error message and the assignment appeared to be submitted on my end when I turned it in before work. Either way I worked until 4pm that Saturday so I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get it in within that time frame. On Sunday the 30th, my professor posts that grades are accurate in the grade book and I notice my assignment never submitted. I quickly reach out in a panic and send her my time stamp proof of when my assignment was recorded and finished and that it was a canvas technical issue, not a lack of time management or carelessness. She does not respond. On Monday the 1st, I go in person and I attempt to explain to her showing her the proof of my assignment being done and she tells me I \u201cwasn\u2019t aggressive enough in submitting my assignment\u201d and that she \u201cwasn\u2019t convinced\u201d because she gave us an extension on Saturday. I explained to her that I was at work all day so when I saw her message I assumed it was an automatic message to everyone in the course like an announcement since I had taken the time to submit my assignment beforehand. The announcements and canvas messages get sent to my email and appear the same at first glance. Because again, I was at work I wasn\u2019t able to fully check my phone at my shift. I explained to her that I genuinely didn\u2019t know my assignment didn\u2019t submit, videos upload weird on canvas and I took the time to record and submit before the due date and I had time stamps to prove it. Even if I knew on Saturday that my assignment wasnt turned in I couldn\u2019t have turned it in within her timeframe anyways since I worked until 4pm. She told me she\u2019d think about it and I waited. I emailed her that following Friday and she told me she was actually not accepting late work. However, she offered other students an extension the Saturday before so I don\u2019t understand why she won\u2019t take my assignment that was completed on time. I am a 4.0 student at CSULB and without this assignment in the grade book I am at a 83%. I am thinking of contacting the department chair because I don\u2019t think I should be at fault for a technical error that I can prove with my time stamps of when my video assignment was recorded. What do you guys think? I\u2019m so devastated, I work so hard for my GPA and this has honestly never happened to me before. I am willing to submit a grade appeal next semester has anyone ever done that? Because I was looking into it and technically I do think it falls under capricious grading since she offered other students an extension, told me she would think about giving it to me and then told me she decided not to. I am trying to apply to PA school once I graduate this year so this B can get in the way of my acceptance.",

            "comment": "Your first step is to contact Canvas IT support and open a ticket to prove that there was a LMS error. Second, I'd document all the announcements, screenshots of your submission, and email interactions regarding the case. Finally, if you're going to contact the department chair (which you have the right to in your case) or end up escalating the issue, be as objective as possible. State the events that occured and how you tried to resolve the issue. Cite the syllabus, department, or school policies if need be. No one cares that you're a 4.0 student and want to apply to PA school, leave that out. You're not winning sympathy points. It won't look good on you. \n\n\nDon't let any faculty (or admin) tell you that you don't have a case. I went through something similar where I was discouraged from appealing by the ombudsperson, dean of students, etc. but with all the proof I cited I won very convincingly.",

            "comment": "Hi. I'm a professor in the COMM department. I may be able to offer some insight. This is definitely not a matter for the department chair. The chair doesn't have any power to make an instructor accept late work. If you are not successful at changing your professor's mind, your only recourse is to file a grade appeal. That said, nothing you've outlined in this post would likely result in a successful appeal. What you've described as \"capricious\" isn't capricious because the same opportunity was extended to everyone in the class. You had two opportunities to submit the assignment: on the due date and on Saturday.  Everyone else in class had the same two opportunities. In fact, it was gracious for the professor to extend an additional opportunity. For her grading to be considered capricious, she'd had to establish different modes of grading for different students. That's not what happened here. I've got two pieces of advice:\n\n1. You said that your grade without the assignment is an 83%. Is this single assignment worth 7% or more of your final grade in the class? Have you taken the final yet? In other words, this grade may be a non-factor after you take the final. You may have a \"B\" with or without the assignment. If that's the case, worrying about the missed assignment is a waste of time. If the points earned on this assignment potentially push you to an \"A\" after the final exam, move to idea number 2.\n2. Let me preface this by saying that you are totally at the mercy of the instructor. Professors deal with a lot of unique circumstances at the end of the semesters. There's typically a rush of people trying to cobble together points to inflate their final grades. The end of the semester is a uniquely bad time to make a request. She may feel like she's heard you make your case and doesn't want to hear it again. That's within her right. Here's the approach I'd take. You want to pen a CONCISE email. All the timeline stuff you detailed above is too much information. If the assignment is only a video with no written accompaniment, I'd take a screenshot of the evidence you have that proves the time and date the video was recorded. Send a short email where you explain 3 things: 1) You were an \"A\" student all semester and currently have a 4.0 at CSULB; failing to submit an assignment is inconsistent with the commitment you've demonstrated this semester and at the university. 2) Explain one more time that this was a legitimate technological mishap. Take responsibility for not double-checking that the assignment was properly submitted. There's some blame-shifting in your post and that won't help you build a persuasive case. 3) Attach the screenshot to the email. Consider sending the professor a digital copy of the video--not through Canvas but attached to the email. See if she might be willing to check the \"date created\" on the video you sent her. Maybe even attach a link to a webpage that offers instructions for how she can find that information. The idea here is to provide evidence that backs up your claim that this was a technical mishap, which partly explains why you didn't think the Saturday extension email applied to you.\n\nIt's better to do all this in person or via Zoom. A lot of humanity gets erased by email. I know you attended office hours once before but it couldn't hurt to try and squeeze in one more face-to-face or Zoom meeting. Text flattens, faces humanize.\n\nFrom what you outlined in this message, it seems like she's already been more than reasonable. It would be *radically* compassionate for her to accept your assignment at this point. In fact, one could argue that extending a THIRD opportunity to you would qualify as capricious, unless she extended everyone else in the class a third chance to submit the work. At any rate, good luck. Stuff like is frustrating on both ends. I hope y 'all come to some sort of resolution that makes both of you feel good. :)",

                    "comment": "Hi! Yeah so basically I did submit the screenshot and the actual video through email. I also explained that I am a 4.0 student and I explained to her in person that I have submitted every other assignment in the course. Unfortunately, her grading scale is rather harsh. We didn\u2019t have many heavy assignments all semester so this assignment is very dependent on my final grade. It was only a 90 second video so I\u2019m not sure why she refuses to grade it :/ I have attached my final email to her since I was basically repeating myself in the prior emails and just asking her to believe me with the screenshots and explanations. \n\n\u201cThank you for your response. I take your class very seriously and I enjoy your lectures. I understand your decision, however, I would like to ask you to make a special consideration for me. \nHere are the reasons: \nI have shown you proof that I recorded the assignment prior to the submission deadline. I have attached screenshots here again for your reference. This was a technical issue.\nI am a straight A, 4.0 GPA student. I am the first person in my family to attend university. I take your course very seriously and I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my chances of getting into a good graduate program. \nI work two jobs to pay my way through school, so I don't have much free time.  I worked all day on Wednesday and Saturday and was unable to check my emails. I have very little free time so I meticulously plan my weekly schedule to ensure I can accomplish everything I need to do. \nRegardless of all of these points, I understand that it is still my responsibility to monitor my submissions for technical errors. I really wish I had more time to do that in this case. My main goal is to get an A in your class, and this assignment goes a long way toward helping me achieve that goal. Is there anything else I can do to demonstrate myself here? \u201c",

So regardless of how well I did in all other areas in the course it doesn\u2019t matter much if she gives me a 0 in that one assignment. I appreciate your insight as a professor, I guess I will just take my loss and hope for the best in regards to grad school",

I can very much understand they might not have had the time or thought about that in the moment either. I don't know. I don't really care. I also understand that our society kinda primes us to think the worst of each other and it's not really about *me*.

Describing people as triggered when they're just calling out an injustice they see is mildly infuriating every time because it degrades the weight of the clinical use of the word from which it has been misappropriated -- language which is important to bringing about awareness and meaningful change. It feels gaslighty; like, \"don't listen to them because they're just mentally ill.\" Gross. This person was irritated, not necessarily triggered, and they have a right to be imho. I share the same frustrations frankly; but I'm giving benefit of the doubt to OP assuming natural immaturity that comes from the inexperience of youth. You don't necessarily capture active accidents often, so I can understand the moment of like \"uh what do I do with this?\" I understand the concern of hit and runs but next time, stop and leave a note that says \"I've got it on my dash cam\" and/ or forward it to campus police, or better yet check on the driver before posting it to the internet to be ridiculed without ~~all~~ any of the information by strangers. I don't have to be mad about it but other people are allowed to be. It was kind of shitty and it did have a negative impact. Live, learn, move on.",

Sorry it bothered you.\n\nSecondly, I think the issue here is that as you said, everyone here has done something seemingly shitty but none of it was malicious. \n\nYou backed straight into a car in the parking lot, it was seemingly a shitty thing to do, but OP, OP\u2019s friend, and everyone else here didn\u2019t know. None of us knew you left a note, none of us knew you had a panic attack.\n\nIf OP truly had malicious intent, wouldn\u2019t they be claiming that you were an idiot, an asshole, etc. even after you were found here? OP clearly gave you the reason that they posted it. They retrieved it from a friend who didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\nNow putting a barrage of name-calling and degrading of someone through multiple long, unnecessary rants already has disregarded any sense of respect for OP as a human, but we\u2019re also forgetting that their friend is also a human as well. This friend made a mistake too, and as you said, since we don\u2019t know the reason, this other angry and extremely disrespectful person is taking matters into their own hands to decide where the line between Justice and injustice lies.\n\nSince the moral of the story is that we always think the worst of people, I\u2019ll just go ahead and let you read OP\u2019s response, then read the messages that this other person responded to them with.\n\nNow here we are, thinking the worst of the OP\u2019s friend. Claiming that the OP should walk up to the driver and ask them if they\u2019re okay? Saying they should leave a note, right in front of the driver that hit the car? Those are extremely big asks of this person. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever experienced it, but I\u2019ve had someone point a gun at me out of their car before. The general public is extremely scary, and even now when people hit me, I still tremble getting out of my car. Not because of the accident, but because of my fear of what could happen next. That is the one and only experience I need to NEVER take either of those pieces of advice.\n\nSecondly, taking this to the police would not do anything. In the state of California, there\u2019s no police enforcement of hit-and-runs. Not to mention, a valid concern of the original owner of the video is uneasiness when interacting with the police.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of reasons OP or original owner wouldn\u2019t have done anything. Maybe they had a panic attack as well? I guess we just don\u2019t know enough.\n\nTo wrap it up, as it\u2019s not fair for anyone to disregard your humanity for an honest mistake with an acceptable reason, please recognize it\u2019s equally unfair for you, this other angry person, or anyone else here to crucify the OP and their friend without knowing their full reason for their behavior, either.",

I turned my car off, called my husband, and fully calmed down before hitting the road again. I appreciate the post in case witnesses thought I might have ditched out but the comments are hot garbage y'all. I've been driving for nearly 20 years and this is my first ever at-fault accident, and the extent of the damage is a small dent. \n\nThank you to the guys that noticed I was struggle bussing and checked in on me. Your kindness is very much appreciated. \n\nIn the meantime, fuck the misogynists especially",

You don't need to tell me the importance of not operating heavy machinery when I was already trying to remain safely stationary. The lesson learned wasn't in the importance but in the execution. Like I said, I immediately turned it off and fucking trust me, I've made a note for the future to just deal. \n\nBut a big contributor to the overstimulation in that moment was dripping with sweat, so it's easy to dismiss comfort as trivial, but cognitively, when you're trying to calm down a panic attack, comfort is pretty important to assure the brain that everything is, in fact, ok. Adults don't necessarily carry around safety blankets or toys or whatever like young children, but the cognitive processes are similar.",

Are you planning to go for a masters degree? If so maybe it\u2019s a little more justified but honestly the cost benefit of an A vs. a B it prob isn\u2019t worth it. Your grades really won\u2019t make a huge difference and what makes you think this time you will definitely get an A. Since it\u2019s a GE class and prob not within your major it prob matters even less if you didn\u2019t score perfectly.",

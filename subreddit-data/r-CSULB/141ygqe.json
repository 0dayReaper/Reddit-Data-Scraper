    "postText": "This is never an easy thing to admit, but my first year here in CSULB has been marred with several personal issues and I\u2019ve really been at my all time lowest point. Couple that with the level of difficulty of my major (mech engineering) and never being that interested in it, things really snowballed grade wise, especially this past semester. I had a 3.2 GPA prior to transferring, but my CSULB GPA is only at a 1.95 after these two semesters and this morning I was notified that I was placed on warning. What should I expect being on academic warning?",

            "comment": "First thing I think you should do is take some self inventory. Be nicer to yourself. You\u2019re a college student majoring in STEM and it sounds like you\u2019re doing it without drive. Burnout is going to happen. Also, and this may just be me relating to something that\u2019s not there, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume one of those personal issues could be financial, and if that\u2019s not the case I\u2019m sorry but I struggle with balancing my finances so I can relate if it is. My advice here is to first forgive yourself and think on your accomplishments first. Then, take a look at what you CAN do while facing this time of your life. Even if it\u2019s a little thing, do things that seem less mountainous.\nMy advice for your classes is also similar. Are you working full time (or enough time to cover finances)? Not a lot of people can juggle a full time job and relative responsibilities while also being a full time student. Maybe lighten your course load. It\u2019s not a race to the finish line. I also struggled with that myself, wanting to finish college \u201con time,\u201d but I had to take a look at how my life was situated and my own bandwidth and realized I couldn\u2019t juggle it all at once. So if you can relate to that, maybe instead of 12-18 units a semester, you take 9 or less. It\u2019s less tuition and less of a load on your psyche. And maybe that\u2019s what makes you enjoy your major less. I hope any of this helps and just know it\u2019s okay to struggle but don\u2019t stay struggling for the sake of something you don\u2019t want to.",

I know this situation is far from ideal but just take a breather for now and take it one step at a time. On the bright side, your current GPA isn\u2019t that bad, and lifting acadamemic probation within one sememster is totally doable!  I\u2019d say make sure to talk to your counselor first and foremost to figure out a game plan for the next semester. The most vitable option is to take a combination of easy courses and your failed courses and figure out what put you in academic probation in the first place. A lot of people are on probation more than you think.  \n\nAs someone who\u2019s been in academic warning couple times and even got academic disqualification and have turned my life around. I can assure you it\u2019s totally possible to get back on track. Don\u2019t ever feel discouraged or  ashamed that you were ever in academic probation in the first place! Feel free to message me if you need some moral support!",

Just like you I recently transferred and I am in mechanical engineering so if you need any help or just someone to talk to let me know maybe we can exchange discords and just chat!",

            "comment": "Academic advisor here with two pieces of advice that are not mutually exclusive even though they may seem like it.\n\n1. You need to raise your cumulative GPA, not just get a better single-semester GPA. The cumulative GPA is harder to move if you take all new courses, but easier to move if you retake a course with a super low grade and get a good one to replace it.\n\n2. You should seriously consider switching majors to one where you can be interested and do better. There's no point in spending extra semesters (because you have to keep retaking courses) to get a degree you hate when you could switch, graduate quicker, and move to a job you prefer.",

If you do change your major, which it seems like you should, then it may not make sense to repeat anything. I\u2019ll also say that \u201ccumulative GPA\u201d should be qualified as either the Overall (CSULB coursework + all accepted transfer coursework) and CSULB GPA (only CSULB coursework). In almost all scenarios, the CSULB GPA is the one that gets transfer students on academic warning. \n\nI recommend seeing an academic advisor in the University Center for Undergraduate Advising to discuss a change of major and to understand your grade point deficiency calculation, which will give you tangible grades you need to earn in your planned courses for next semester to get off academic warning and back in good standing. \n\nI\u2019m also a former academic advisor at CSULB.",

            "comment": "I often lurk this sub and am a student at LMU, I was placed on academic probation for having 3 C\u2019s. I passed 2/3 of my classes the following semester with B+\u2019s, but one of my professors was such a douche and literally gave majority of the class F\u2019s, including me. This led to me getting academically disqualified and even after appealing the dean wouldn\u2019t budge. My school really sucks. \n\nMy best advice to you would be to communicate as much as possible with your professors before/after exams, and figure out ways to improve. Spend more time at school if you can, pick up better study habits, definitely look into resources that your school provides whether it be therapy/counseling or tutoring. Your mental health matters a ton so don\u2019t forget to put yourself first, but still maintain a good GPA for the semester. Best of luck",

    "postText": "Dorm itself was ok, but the experience and what i HEARD there was horrible lol, some nights i couldn\u2019t sleep, and if i managed to sleep i would wake up at 4 am to a couple moaning at the top of their lungs, brave i would say but also selfish. Anyone else had any experiences like this before? Please tell me i\u2019m not the only one",

Didn\u2019t hear moaning or even loud music once. Never had an issue with smoking either- everyone i knew just smoked outside / directly into the open window",

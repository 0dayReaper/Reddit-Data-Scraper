That info should should already be listed next to the course information that tells you the course number and teacher name. for location, it will say something like \u201chybrid\u201d \u201cin-person\u201d or \u201ctbd\u201d.   \n\n\nIf you happen to see a building name with room number, including a date/ time/ teacher listed, assume that you probably will meet for the first class in-person until it\u2019s announced by the professor other wise. You can also email the listed professor or department head to find out.\n\nid recommend checking your student email for updates and make sure you know how to navigate your Canvas account and MyCSULB accounts. You should be able to log into Canvas already. When you add your classes, you will participate and meet on Canvas as your classroom.",

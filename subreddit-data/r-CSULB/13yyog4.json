    "postText": "Hello I just wanted to ask experienced students at CSULB about things I need to do and look out for at the moment. Some of the things I have completed is accepting all my financial aid that I needed, I found my roommate on the housing application and verified the group, I chose my SOAR dates. What else do I need to do before SOAR in August? Any forms I need to fill out? Things I need to complete?",

However, I did not room at Long Beach so there may be a few things on that side I am unaware of.\n\nRegarding soar, they will set time assisted for you to meet with someone and they will recommend classes to you. I believe classes related to your major will have seats set aside for incoming students as well, so you will get in. They will also have a recommendation for your 2nd semester.\n\nBest of luck at Long Beach!",

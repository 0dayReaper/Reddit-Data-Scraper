I just got back from housing that I\u2019m #713 on the paid list TT-TT \nAre my chances super low? I\u2019m looking forward to a double at the transfer community, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even possible. \nAnyone who was in a similar situation? I\u2019m nervous about off campus housing, it seems like a lot with getting the furnitures. I haven\u2019t really done much research on off campus housing, so I don\u2019t really know how it\u2019s works as on when we are on break and stuff.",

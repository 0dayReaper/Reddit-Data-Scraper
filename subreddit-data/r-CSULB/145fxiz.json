    "postText": "For some reason, when I go to change my preferred email, the options to delete or add a new email address are both grayed out. I can change my name, my home address, and everything else, but not my email. I wanted to change it because I was originally using my old student email since that was the best way to reach me, but I wanted to change it to my new student email. While my old student email is obviously still in use (I'm not sure when it'll stop being usable, I'm assuming after I stop attending the school for a couple of semesters), I'd still rather have things be sent to my new one for obvious reasons. Anyone else having the same issue?\n\nAlso, while I'm here, they're asking for a transcript with my ADT by July 15. I ordered a transcript from my CC, but now I'm worried that they were talking about my Cal State application, which I legitimately forgot about until just now. I went in to edit it but I can't. Should I be worried? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just felt I should ask just in case.",

I would still email them just to triple check, but yeah I got the same transcript request as well.",

I'd call your cc to make sure ur official transcript has the adt on it already - that's what I had to do because my adt wasn't uploaded on it yet until I told them I had a deadline.",

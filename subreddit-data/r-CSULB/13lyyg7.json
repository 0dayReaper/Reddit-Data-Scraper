Sure they signed the online petition, but thats easy to do. The issue was out of those thousands of people and the 800 students in our discord channel only 15 showed up to our last protest and 30 to the first one. In order for Jane to make any change, YOU GUYS (2024 seniors) need to actually want to make change. The biggest way is by showing up to protests. I am not trying to be a dick, but I was pretty disappointed in the students at CSULB, like I know students are busy, but really, a 15 person protest? I know there were way more people that had the time to come but just didn't want to.",

Call her out on all her BS. Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/KCfzvjFYdXY) and send it to everyone you know because there\u2019s so many people that don\u2019t know she makes more than the sitting president and is provided housing by the university. \n\nI really, really hope 2024 gets to walk but if not please sign up for the cultural ceremonies. If you don\u2019t see anyone that aligns with yours start a club and start to make the plans now to get something small or big to happen on campus so you can have your name read and have some family there.

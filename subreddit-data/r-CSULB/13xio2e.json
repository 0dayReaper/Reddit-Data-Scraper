    "postText": "Hello, my name is Matthew! I'm currently 19, but will be 20 by the time we move back. I'm gonna be a Junior, and my current major is Psychology\ud83e\udee1. Here are some things about me:\n\n* I am gay (if that matters I know people have preferences)\n* I do smoke occasionally (if you don't smoke that's okay, but if you do that is a plus)\n* I typically go to sleep around midnight-2am \n* I am a pretty social person so I don't mind if we have visitors\n* I'm not a major clean freak your side is your side, but I will appreciate someone who does clean up frequently and who is hygienic\n*  I'm really trying to get a 2-bedroom suite in parkside north (sorry freshman the 2-bedroom suites aren't open to y'all)\n\nI'm a pretty chill person who respects boundaries especially since we will be living together so having peace is a must. I tend to go back home at least once or twice a month on the weekends (which starts Thursday for me). Feel free to dm here if you're interested :).",

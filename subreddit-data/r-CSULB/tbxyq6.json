This bail schedule is a book of crimes with their bail amounts preset by the LA County courts at the start of each year. Think of it like a menu at a restaurant. You commit DUI? $20k bail. Add on an accident? Add $10k. Cause some injuries in the accident? Add $100k. So the total bail would be $130k (numbers just for example). \n\nSince COVID, LA County enacted an \u201cemergency COVID\u201d bail schedule which basically eliminated bail for all crimes except serious/violent felonies. The only way to get a legit bail right now is to have committed a serious/violent felony, or to be arrested again while already out on bail for another crime. \n\nIf you don fall into one of these categories you get a $0 bail. If you commit the same crime you committed before, you\u2019re supposed to get the full, normal bail amount. I\u2019m not sure where the $1 bail comes from, but I\u2019d guess it was that he was out on bail for an unrelated crime, and since he got arrested they were able to put $1. This last sentence is a guess though. I only know about $0 bails or the full shebang. \n\nThe $1 bail is a result of this emergency bail schedule.",

Liberal laws in the justice system have told criminals that they can do whatever they want without fear of repercussion. People are looting malls and stores, citizens are opening their trunks in SF to tell looters not to steal with them, students are masturbating in PUBLIC? And the solution is to give them an \"equitable punishment?\" Truly delusional.",

White-collar crimes, like Holmes and Madoff, would be a federal prison at an average cost of $39,158 per year, while California's per inmate cost is $106,131 per year.  Society does not benefit from spending on an inmate unless it increases safety.\n\nSo no... I do not think people like Holmes and Madoff should go to jail.  Take their passports, seize and distribute their assets to the victims, put a financial lien on their future earnings, utilize house arrest and parole, levy fines, and require community service.\n\nThey aren't a risk of assault, battery, murder, etc... so let's save the $100k per year and put it towards areas where society actually benefits.",

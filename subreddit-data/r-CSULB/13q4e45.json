They\u2019re going to make you annoy the hell out of your friends and family in an attempt to sell them Cutco knives. They have classically targeted naive high school and college students for decades. Post this in r/antimlm for more info.\n\nNotice the $27 is not an hourly wage at all, it\u2019s a \u201cbase appointment\u201d whatever the fuck that means.",

Knives are crazy expensive though. Then they are supposed to call up friends to help you set up a new appointment.  That's how you get your clients. I, of course, kept my demo set and still have some pieces to this day.  Had them for about 15 years now.",

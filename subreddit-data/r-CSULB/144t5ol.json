    "postText": "Hello!\n\nMy name is Piper (she/her) and I'm an incoming transfer student for this coming Fall semester. I plan to live on campus (I'm hoping for a single but I still think it's important to look for a roommate as well), and I looked at the roommate selector through the housing portal but I wasn't sure how active people are on there so I figured I would post here as well to see if anyone else was looking. I usually go to bed sometime around 12ish as I tend to stay up late using my computer and I usually wake up around 9-10ish. I enjoy gaming and reading in my spare time. I'm not the tidiest person but I try my best to keep things organized and clean to prevent stress. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to message me!",

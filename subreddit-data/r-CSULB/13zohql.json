            "comment": "I think much of it is heavily dependent on time management. Have you had past experience with juggling work or extracurriculars alongside the workload? Does your major require more studying? Do you hold a supportive foundation in case your finances completely fall apart (bills, etc.)? I think a lot about this in my own experience, especially with a poor financial background. Last semester I was involved in many extracurriculars on campus while working part time every Monday and Friday (sometimes on the weekends too), alongside managing time. Personally, I rarely saw family members throughout the whole week (I commute). Idk if you would count that as a social life, but you can determine that. There are a ton of variables that can come into play, and most of the time life is just going to hit you unexpectedly. Regardless of the circumstances, if you believe you can achieve it, go for it; but if you can\u2019t, remember you\u2019re the one in control of creating boundaries that will ensure your success.",

I just graduated from the FEA department as a film student and 2 of my 5 classes were hands-on project based classes so of course we didn\u2019t really have the same kind of assignments as my other classes. In production management and the international film classes, we had assignments that we actually had to turn in, such as essays or mock budgets, you get the gist. So if you are doing a mix of hands-on (not too much homework) classes and theory/information based (essays, more homework) classes, you will be okay and still have time to go out and enjoy life. I also commuted but scheduled classes at a smart time to limit traffic to 35/40 minutes each way. Best of luck to you!\n- recent graduate",

My suggestion would be try to take them, go to the classes and read the Syllabus of each class carefully on the first week, then decide if you would like to take all of the classes or adjust your class schedule accordingly.\n\nAlso, welcome to CSULB :)\nGood luck with everything!",

    "postText": "Hello to all hope everyone is doing great! I\u2019m an incoming transfer and a question regarding cal grants if anyone has been in a similar situation. \n\nI went onto CSAC and it showed I was awarded a cal grant but didn\u2019t tell me which one specifically and on the school of attendance, it listed my cc not sure why as I listed CSULB first. I then changed the school of attendance to CSULB, and as soon as I did I got this pop up instantly saying I wasn\u2019t awarded for any cal grant. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an error on CSAC\u2019s end because I do know I qualify, could it just be saying i\u2019m denied because they have to review my application again/they haven\u2019t finished processing applications for csulb yet or am I just flat out rejected from grants now? Last year when I was planning on transferring to csulb, I was awarded a cal grant, but decided to take a break off from school and was banking on the cal grant to help out this year :(. Feel like i\u2019m overthinking this but seeing not awarded is worrying me \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",

            "comment": "I work for CSAC, and you could potentially be eligible for C1. I say \"potentially\" because it is not guaranteed since you are competing against other students for the same grant and we have limited number of awards available each year (22/23 - we have stopped running new competitive students because we have met our paid rate for the year). As long as your app was in by March 2nd, we can run you for C1 (if we are running this cycle at the moment), but it's risky as you may not get awarded depending on the information you listed on your FAFSA/CADAA. Again, it's a possibility only if your app was on time.",

When I called csac earlier today the lady did tell me I could be eligible for C1, she ran me and told me my score was barely too low to meet C1 said it involved gpa, efc, household status and other requirements :/. I think \n my best luck atp is to do one semester at cc then apply for transfer again since she told me I was guaranteed the E2 award.",

But with Cal Grant Reform (hopefully when it goes through), this all is going to change. We are only going to have Cal Grant 2 for community college students and Cal Grant 4 for four years, making it easy and simple. \n\nE2 has an age requirement of 28 as well. Make sure you are not aging out by next year.",

The only possible way I can get the E2 grant now is to withdraw my csulb application again, attend one semester at a cc, then reapply as a transfer to another csu and i would be guaranteed the E2 which i\u2019m not sure if i should do \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",

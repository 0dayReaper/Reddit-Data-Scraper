Half the shit in our school doesn\u2019t work, can\u2019t even open the doors to some of our classes. Handicap buttons don\u2019t work to open doors, I would go on and on and here she is writing an opinion piece on something she barely knows anything about. Sounds like she wants to run for public office or some shit.  smh. \n\nGarbage email\u2026 \n\nI think every one of us feels for Ukraine and we mostly stay updated ourselves we don\u2019t need her opinion, go do the job you\u2019re supposed to do.",

I\u2019ve heard people give the most ludicrous takes about this war that just confirm their complete lack of understanding of the catastrophic impact that it is going to have on hundreds of millions of people for many years to come while it\u2019ll be completely forgotten here and painfully repeated in history due to the world\u2019s inaction, or rather selective action when it comes to helping people. I\u2019m Armenian and I totally get your frustration, I just wish people would take action more often because this sort of stuff happens around the world a lot more than some folks realize and there\u2019s just a lot of double standards going on and direct involvement that has unspeakable consequences that just get swept under the rug because its convenient.

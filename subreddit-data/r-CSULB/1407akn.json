    "postText": "im currently an incoming second year biochem major student and ive been meaning to apply to some research programs at school but i have no prior experience to any research or work related opportunities and im just a little worried and anxious about being unqualified or not useful in the program.\n\nso what exactly do you do in these research programs and do you need to know a lot about the subject of field beyond what youve learned in courses youve taken or read from textbooks?",

            "comment": "It really depends on the program.  Most of these will publish a list of requirements (prerequisites, class level, GPA, etc).  Prerequisites are sometimes very specific (a list of classes required to be completed will be provided), while others are more open and they will provide guidance as part of participating.  Some programs are looking for students who are at a specific point in their class level (with a specific number of units completed, etc), while others are looking for a broader mix of students.  Likewise, some programs want \"excellent\" students with high grades in their upper division, while other programs are looking for a mix of students at different performance levels.  There may be special qualifying factors such as low-income, underrepresented, resident of a specific region, planning on pursuing graduate school, etc.  \n\nThe best way to proceed is to read the requirements carefully, and ask lots of questions as early as possible.  Most good schools offer research programs which are generally open to all students, not only those from their own campus.  So, don't limit yourself to just those being offered at your own school.  Almost all research programs (especially STEM) are competitive, so you want to begin your search as early as possible and apply to as many of these as you can!  \n\nThere is an excellent summer research series at USC for STEM undergraduates called \"JumpStart\" (unfortunately it's too late to apply for Summer 2023), but this will give you a good idea of what you might be doing as an undergraduate participant in one of these programs:\n\nhttps://home.csulb.edu/~wmurray/announcements/USCJumpStart2023.pdf\n\nAdditional programs here (mainly math/stats, but also STEM related):\n\nhttps://home.csulb.edu/~wmurray/announcements.html#summer",

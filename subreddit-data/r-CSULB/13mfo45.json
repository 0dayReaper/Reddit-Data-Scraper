    "postText": "on May 4,2023 I submitted my class project, it looked fine on my end seeing I submitted it the same way as my other projects. On May 9,2023 I received a 0/30 grade on that project with the comment \"file corrupted\". Now that for one is a technical error that I could not have prevented considering again, I submitted my work the same as my others that had no problem . I unfortunately did not see the comment until May 11,2023 when in which i messaged them on discord seeing that they state our emails \"get lost\" so don't email them. I informed them of this and asked for another way to submit it considering I did the full work and on time. I understand late policy which is in their syllabus but it is not as if I didn't submit the project at all and wanted them to cater to that. I received no response from them until today May 19,2023 when I messaged them regarding my grade being a D rather than the C it should have been (especially since I did 3 extra credit homework's and not one did anything) they replied \"The project had a 2 week availability. The syllabus clearly states what the late policy is and I mentioned it for weeks in class that these projects and assignments will not be accepted late. The grade was inputted as a D because that was the grade you earned. Have a good rest of your summer.\". This response had absolutely nothing to do with my situation especially seeing that it was a technical error that was found AFTER that 2 week window. (I did inform them I\u2019d be filing for a grade appeal)",

            "comment": "The grade appeal is the best bet. Unfortunately for most of these instances the syllabus is basically the final say\u2026 so you just need to emphasize that 1. You submitted the original assignment on time 2. The issue was due to an exigent circumstance out of your control 3. Emailed the professor *within* the two week window 4. They only responded *after* that two week window. \n\nAgain, you will have it tough since the professor is probably just going to be an a**hole and refer to syllabus. Be prepared to really argue your point - you did everything in your power to rectify the issue within the 2 week window and the professor was the only who was slacking.",

In the past few semesters I have had one professor who doesn\u2019t accept anything past the due date, even if the file is corrupted. He would always remind us to double check our files is corrupted and it was stated in his syllabus.",

So make it compelling, make it honest, and stick to your script. It is an uphill battle and no matter what the University says, they actually can't force the professor to change a grade.",

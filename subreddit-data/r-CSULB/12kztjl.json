    "postText": "Hey everyone I got offered a conditional admission for this fall! Woohoo! But I sent them my transcripts and ADT Verification about a month and a half ago. I haven\u2019t received an email about the confirmation of those documents. However my friend who got in as well has received his March 28. I checked my inquiry status and it says \u201cAdmitted subject to confirmation and requested documents have been received\u201d I\u2019m not sure what this means and I haven\u2019t accepted my admission yet because I want to receive the email saying that they\u2019ve received my documents and confirmed them. The reason Im waiting is because my friend had his acceptance withdrawn because of his transcripts. Im not sure what to do. Should I accept my admission after receiving the confirmation email? Or am I in the clear to accept my admission and move forward with the next steps?",

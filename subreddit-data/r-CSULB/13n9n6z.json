As others have said, the types of aid you receive will determine how long and the total amount you can receive while completing your BA/BS. My advice is to speak with a financial aid counselor in Brotman Hall to see what you specifically qualify for. You also want to make sure you\u2019re maintaining eligibility by keeping a 20 minimum GPA each term, completing at least 66% of your coursework a year, and staying under the maximum allowed units for undergraduate FA (I think it\u2019s like 160).",

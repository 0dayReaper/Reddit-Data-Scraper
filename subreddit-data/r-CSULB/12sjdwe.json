I know it\u2019s gonna be almost impossible right now to get a single room even if I apply but since I barely signed up would there still be space available?? \nAlthough commuting would be cheaper, I would have to commute an hour from home to campus. Would living off campus be ideal? Thank y\u2019all for your help, excited to start now in the fall",

I would look into apartments nearby, they\u2019re typically much cheaper but you\u2019ll be looking at a small commute (likely 5-15 min drive minimum). Depends how much you dislike driving to campus. You could always schedule your classes for only 2 days a week on campus",

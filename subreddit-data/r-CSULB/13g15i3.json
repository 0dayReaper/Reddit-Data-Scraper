My cumulative gpa was 3.8, and science gpa was 4.0. Just try to keep your science gpa to as close to 4.0 as possible because it is very heavily weighted. if you get a B or C in a GE it\u2019s not the end of the world :)",

I don\u2019t think your ethnic studies class counts as a core class. Core would be stats, English, critical thinking, communications and i am forgetting what else but I don\u2019t believe ethnic studies is on there.",

It says the GE cumulative GPA includes written communication, oral communication, statistics and critical thinking class. I\u2019m not sure if ethnic studies counts as the GE A3 requirement for critical thinking but it might. Look at that course catalog and you should be able to figure it out. \n\nAlso don\u2019t listen to the other person below. Of course straight As are preferred but one B in a core class isn\u2019t the end of the world if you can score a high teas and get all As on your science classes. The sciences are weighted heavier than the core classes.",

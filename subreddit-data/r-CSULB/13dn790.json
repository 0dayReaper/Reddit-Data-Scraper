The 250B works better in my schedule for the fall sem but wondering if it's odd to do it before I take 250A. Does it matter or no",

Since they are both survey classes, I recommend selecting the course that best fits with your schedule. You'll be assigned several readings, so it's best to go with the class occuring on days most convenient to you. Good luck!",

    "postText": "for anyone taking it this year or in general, as long as you can write a well-thought-out essay then you're chilling. if you struggle in writing because it isn't your specialty i suggest just doing the good ol 5 paragraph essay and you'll be in the right direction. you have 75 minutes to complete it and have a short story to read before you begin to write. i did the online portion and i guess the only nerve-racking thing is having the camera on you but even when i was writing out my thoughts to the side( you can do that but make sure to throw away the paper after) i didn't have an issue of having to look directly in the camera or attention called for it. so as long as you don't look sus doing things you shouldn't be doing nothing should happen so good luck to everyone taking it this week/year. :)",

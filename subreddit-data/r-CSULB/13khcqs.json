I took some courses through open university (to show them how serious I was), and got straight A\u2019s in the basic classes (AutoCAD, Surveying etc). When I applied a second time, I was again rejected. I\u2019ll be graduating from UNLV this Fall with a projected 3.8 GPA. I appreciate my mentor/professor at UNLV who encouraged me to conduct research (twice this past year) and will be looking to publish soon. Women in STEM are not a priority for CSULB. I don\u2019t know what the heck is going on there, but hearing about the BS graduations they have going on, makes me realize that the CSULB rejections were BLESSINGS. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb  Thank God for that shut door.",

It's a snoozefest of professors who are older than dirt, retirees as lecturers, and young professionals moonlighting at companies and sneaking in to barely teach once a week between jobs. And if you take a look at the faculty roster, any woman faculty of substance was forced to leave due to hostile work environment.",

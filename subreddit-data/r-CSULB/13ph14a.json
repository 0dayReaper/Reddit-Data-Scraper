Do we just wait until our financial aid awards are released, or is there an official announcement per application? Thanks a ton!!",

About a month ago I was invited to a recognition ceremony before the formal notification, and when I went to the Beach Scholarship portal I could see that I was awarded the scholarship but no details about the amount or anything. So you might want to look there even if you haven\u2019t been notified yet.",

I\u2019ve made some friends through class discords and given some of the news I\u2019ve heard about our  potential situation next semester it makes me sad that I might never see these friends in person on this campus. I want to go back but I also want everyone to be safe",

As far as what that entails. \n\nSome courses will be on campus again depending on how many classrooms are available. Availability of classrooms will depend if the actual rooms themselves meet CDC guidelines and even if those rooms meet CDC guidelines they will be at half capacity. I can only assume older buildings might not be available because of inadequate or lack of proper ventilation systems in the building.\n\nThere are meant to be spots on campus for people to stay and study while on campus but they most likely will be outside not in the library. The frequency at which those outside studying spots will be sanitized is debatable but it will be maybe at least once a day. I say this because my professor said they might not sanitize them after  every individual use. This part is probably up in the air the most so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThere obviously will still be online courses as this is at the moment only a partial reopening. I can only assume courses that need to be more hands on will take priority to be the first to come back to face to face learning. There will be some potential for some students to have schedules with online courses and some face to face courses.\n\nI personally am really hoping that we can all go back to campus fully but for that to happen this pandemic needs to be handled. I\u2019ve been watching the covid trends almost everyday now and it makes me hopeful. Everyone please keep your mask on, social distance, stay home as much as possible, wash your hands, and follow the recommendations from the CDC",

It was after a grueling study session with 4 of my classmates and we were happy as fuck having felt confident for a Math 381 final. As we walked to our cars and passed by this spot, we were singing Disney tunes obnoxiously loud and just laughing at our super stupid inside jokes. As simple as that memory might be, the reason for our joy at that time meant a lot for us. None of us had any idea that would be the last time we'd do that before a pandemic would change the world. Regardless, it's definitely one of my favorite memories at CSULB, and not even a pandemic will change that. Thanks for this pic.",

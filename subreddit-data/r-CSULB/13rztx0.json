Food was subpar compared to other dining, mostly dried or no taste but some days are a lottery(they are good and edible). Bathrooms are cleaned by custodian weekly(mostly Thursday/Friday mornings) and shared by 4/5 people depends on the other side(some gets lucky if the other side is a RA then it won\u2019t be so messy) so I guess it\u2019s better than communal bathroom. Also has air conditioned/heater compared to other dorms. Lastly it depends on you on how to socialize, there are 60% of groups of people eating together and 40% are mostly alone or in pairs(just with their roommates).",

My friend and I got lucky and didn\u2019t have anyone in the room next to us during Covid so we basically got it to ourselves but everyone else thought it was fine sharing. The other dorms have communal restrooms.",

The student camaraderie was better at Parkside and Hillside. \n\nIt was also nice  to get a breath off to be \u201coff campus\u201d,  and having a consistent  parking spot at beachside was chill.\n\nAlso if you join greek life, you can get away without wearing pledge attire for the most part if you just stay at Beachside lol",

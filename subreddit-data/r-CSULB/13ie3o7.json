They never do this.\n\nMost official or legitimate university \u2018things\u2019 will need to be filed in person unless it\u2019s related to something initiated by you first\u2026 like if you had a hold on your account, or if you filed a request on MyCSULB. etc.\n\nSo, always assume it\u2019s spam unless you\u2019ve had a prior conversation about whatever the email is about with a teacher or school official prior to receiving it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about and it\u2019s using fear-based strategies to get you to click the link, it\u2019s probably spam. If you\u2019re not sure, just call the school and ask to confirm.",

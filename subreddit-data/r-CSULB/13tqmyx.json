If you want better beaches for swimming and surfing, you can go to Huntington which isn\u2019t too far. There\u2019s also some really good Indian food and different Asian cuisines in Cerritos right up the freeway. This is just my experience being more in East Long Beach rather than downtown tho. Great city, plenty to do, lots of places nearby, but not completely overpopulated.",

There\u2019s always something, farmer markets to art walks to shows to walking on the beach to bars in downtown. \n\nFood- I found that sushi, pizza, thai food, ramen, and seafood are great in LB. Questionable Mexican food (more late night taco stands popping up so that\u2019s cool), not much Viet food or popular chains (TGI\u2019s, Cheesecake\nFactory, Chili\u2019s) unless you go outside LB. \n\nSafety- IMO theft is prevalent. I\u2019ve had multiple friends have their locked up bikes/scooter/motorcycle stolen from right in front of their place. If you have any of these store it inside. \n\nCommunity- Actually pretty close-knit for a \u201cmajor\u201d city. So diverse and accepting. It did not take me very long to feel at home here.",

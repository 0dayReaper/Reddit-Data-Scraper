    "postText": "At first I was considering CPP, but CSULB is closer to my job probably would be better for my schedule, but commute from my place is the same for both schools.\n\nAs I understand from both communities, both CS programs are \"meh\" and you do most of the work on your own. LB just stands out with the whole drama in the CS department last year, but I am assuming that has passed.\n\nI need insight, can't make a decision, deadline is tomorrow...\n\nNote: Transferring from CC",

            "comment": "Commute from CSULB to Pomona sounds pretty bad, you\u2019d be spending more time commuting than the length of your class. If you plan to stay at your job for the duration of school then it\u2019s worth it to go to CSULB, especially if both programs are comparable. You\u2019d be saving time and money on gas and you might be able to take classes earlier since you don\u2019t have to drive too far. I currently commute and a 40mile distance turns into a 1.5hrs traffic jam. When some classes tend to be 1hr 15min I\u2019m spending 2.5hrs of my day commuting. I don\u2019t think this is a hard decision unless CPP is your dream school or top choice",

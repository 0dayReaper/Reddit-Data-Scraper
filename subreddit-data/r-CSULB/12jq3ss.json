    "postText": "These ceremonies are run by student-led cultural organizations. \n\nI keep seeing people asking for stuff from the school and if we have learned anything from the Angels Stadium commencement, they don\u2019t listen to students. These ceremonies are made and run by Cultural orgs who work all semester (even for the entire year) to properly accommodate. \n\nBasically - support the orgs but understand we are at the mercy of whatever funding we get from ASI. We plan for months and I don\u2019t see any way many grad ceremonies would be able to just \u201copen another session\u201d around a month before\u2026 \n\nI know it sucks - but if you do participate in a cultural grad, know that\u2019s student work to let you be recognized, not the school. It\u2019s different for every org but they all work hard. \n\nShout out to every cultural org who runs a grad because I\u2019ve done it twice and wish this work on no one. \n\nFrom a 2 time Cultural Grad Organizer",

Ignore them and keep doing what your doing.",

I\u2019d recommend talking to their organizers if u can get ahold of them - or potentially the SLD advisors who may know more",

We get lucky sometimes when we get donations from communities or alumni that doesn\u2019t have all the strings attached, and I\u2019d worry extra money from admin would have the same. \nStill agree with the fundamental idea we should have more funding. However even maintaining our cultural centers is a fight with administration. \n\nIt\u2019s complicated but I agree there\u2019s way better uses to the funding",

At the very least - if you\u2019re registered, every club should have record of it, so you\u2019ve done your work.",

Idk if u know anyone in the org or would be able to maybe drop by during one of their meetings maybe? Not ideal I know but sometime that is the easiest way. You could also reach out to Student Life and Development cause they work with us to organize - they may have better technical information than we do in terms of logistics",

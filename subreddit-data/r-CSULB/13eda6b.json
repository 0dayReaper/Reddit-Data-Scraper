Students who don\u2019t score an 11 or above on the placement exam have to take an additional course to improve their writing skills before taking the required class.",

If you get the highest grade you will still need to take one class",

            "comment": "The GWAR/GPE is a test that basically evaluates your basic literacy skills, there will be a prompt and you will respond to it in a essay. It\u2019s fairly easy, it\u2019s timed and they give you enough information to make a response. If you\u2019re horrible at writing essays, or have a rough barrier due to language differences, then go to workshops to prepare. If you\u2019re able to do essays without major problems, than you\u2019ll most likely do fine. If you pass, you\u2019ll have to take a writing intensive course, which is usually the last English class of your major, so you don\u2019t have to take an extra unnecessary class (unless you need too, my major had an intensive class in its capstone class (the last English/lit class), I assume it\u2019s the same for all majors). If you fail the test, youll have to take an extra approved writing/English class, as well as an intensive writing course, they\u2019ll email you information on what classes are approved. The test has a fee, a non refundable one. According to the emails, if you don\u2019t sign up for the GWAR soon, you\u2019ll be put on hold from registering to classes, however, I\u2019ve neglected the exam for two semesters and never had a hold, not sure if It was just bugged or not. Just take it when you can, it\u2019s always best to get it out of the way. Best of luck !",

If you dont pass, don't sweat it though. You just have to take an extra easy class. Good for your GPA \ud83d\ude00",

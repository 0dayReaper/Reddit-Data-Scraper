And I just had a few questions!\n\nI recently registered for classes: \n\nCMST 131 - Zachary Justus\nBIOL 161 - Tag Engstrom\nCHEM 111 - Thea Wilson\nMATH 119 - Laurie Kincheloe\n\nI was wondering if this is a doable class load and how are these professors? I was also curious about the amount of support and opportunities that pre meds get at Chico State?",

Usually in groups and actually a great fun way to learn. Trust me I wasn\u2019t the type to ever go to extra help or office hours with my Professor but I went to a SI session for chem 270(O chem) I never stopped going and can honestly say it was the reason for me passing the class. Usually they can go over material in a more understandable student friendly way. And they have some data saying that students that attend SI sessions are more likely to get a entire letter grade higher or something like that than those who don\u2019t but it\u2019s statistically backed that\u2019s why when you get into your classes SI sessions are usually one of the things they push you to do the most. Plus it free ! And I plan to go to PA school, I wanted to go to med school but had some lower grade due to Covid and online school. My gpa is. 3.4 so it\u2019s decent but I honestly think if I could go back I would attend all SI sessions for my difficult chem and physics classes! Also if you have to take those classes DO NOT take shrazkhan omarzai for physics!!! If you ask and cell and Molecular major they will tell you the same trust.",

            "comment": "I would definitely recommend take as many units as you can bear initially because classes will only become more time consuming as you get into your upper division classes. I think I took an average of 17-18 units a semester even had one with 21! It may be a little difficult bc it\u2019s a lot of classes but I find that that the actual coursework for lower division isn\u2019t that difficult. Also I was an athlete so I kinda had to to make my schedule work with my sport so I could still graduate within 4 years. It definitely payed off because now as a senior I\u2019m taking 11 units now and only have 6 units left for my last semester so I can just chill or fill them with yoga classes or something fun which I am most definitely doing! I also had a friend who just graduated who is going to Yale for grad school and I told him what I did and he definitely agreed and also did the same thing. So don\u2019t be agreed to load more units during your freshman and sophomore years. Also a thing that I tied to do was make sure my lower division GE classes double counted for other requirements. Like I took some easier classes that were (W) writing intensive courses that eventually counted to my overall major writing requirements. Take something like food and film journalism or something else that sound fun and requires writing usually isn\u2019t that much writing so don\u2019t let it deter you. Plus attend all SI sessions for any classes they are students who have taken the course and are like student teachers they are super helpful. And lastly try to take as many fun classes as possible find classes that you want to take and seem interesting bc later in you might not have as much as a choice in what classes you want to take. That\u2019s where I felt I missed out on \u201ccollege experience\u201d most people you\u2019ll meet in our major and kinda lane sometimes in your lower division you\u2019ll meet a lot of cool people that are in different majors and make the most friends! Always try to have a much fun as safely and responsibly possible bc this is a great 4 years that\u2019s we\u2019ll never get back and only get to do it once!",

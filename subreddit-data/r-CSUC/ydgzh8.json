See if there are other classes you can take so you don't fall behind on finishing your degree. You may not be able to find a class that fulfills the same prereqs, but you can find classes that you'll still need to take eventually. Often times you won't fall behind on finishing your degree if you do this.  \n\n\nAfter that, go to the full class anyway to see if there are open seats. Don't take a seat away from someone who is actually in the class. Talk to the professor after class and explain that you'd like to take the class but online it says it's full. More often than not, the professor will allow you to take the class. There are some forms that you'll need to fill out to get added.  \n\n\nYou will also want to attend the \"fallback\" class that you found with your advisor as insurance. There is a chance that there aren't enough seats in the full class or that the professor refuses to add you to the class even if there are physical seats available. In this case, continue to take the \"fallback\" class. If you do end up being allowed into the full class, drop your \"fallback\" before the deadline and enjoy having the class setup you wanted.",

            "comment": "First, get on the wait list. Some professors will give preference to students that must take the class (for example if you are graduating soon), and if you are lucky, someone might drop the class. Your plan B is to take some electives, so that you don't go under the recommended credit hours. Talk to your advisor too. They are trained to work with this kind of scenarios.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2018m an incoming exchange student for Fine Arts from Germany and am looking for a place to stay for the 2023/24 school year. I\u2018m 27 and have been living in shared flats for a few years now. I\u2019m chill, easy going, friendly and like to keep the common spaces clean, I\u2019m not a heavy party goer but love to socialize, go out for a drink or hang out with friends. A Queer friendly home would be important for me and also to have a good relationship/spend time with my roomies and have a nice homey environment\ud83d\ude42!  I\u2019ll probably arrive in the US August 1st. So looking for a move in around that date.  Budget ~ 500$ Currently deleted my insta to not get distracted while writing my bachelors lol but if you wanna stalk: @fvx.y",

I am transferring from another CSU into another major (Sociology) so I just need to take major concentration classes... \n\nHow bad is it for us when it's time to register?",

However, all that worrying was for nothing because I managed to get all of my classes! Registration isn't bad at all for transfers, just be ready at the time that registration opens and you should be fine.",

If you get waitlisted it's going to be really hard being online, since you won't have BBL access, but if you can tough it out you'll have a shot at getting in. \n\nAny reasonable prof will let you make up work during the first 2 weeks if you didn't have access due to being waitlisted.",

    "postText": "Senior in Highschool wondering about the cost of Chico. I'm looking to get the best deal between a good 4 year education while also being as cheap as possible as my parents are unable to help me pay for most of my college so I'm hoping to work while I'm in college and hopefully graduate with like 25k debt. I'm wanting to go into game art as my major and get computer science and game design minors.",

            "comment": "Pretty easily to be honest. Chico State [estimates](https://www.csuchico.edu/fa/cost/) the cost of living for on-campus students at $26,728 and $24,754 for off-campus students. It looks like that doesn\u2019t include some costs like food which is a fairly big cost but most can get by comfortably on $200-$300 a month so we\u2019ll call that an extra $3000 a year. So even after adding in some other random expenses you\u2019re still well below the $65kish amount you noted. Chico State in the grand scheme of things is very affordable.\n\nEdit: Wait. Do you mean $60-$70k a year or for your whole time in school?  Because if it\u2019s the latter then ignore everything I said and start getting ready for two years of community college lol. Not even saying that rudely but if you\u2019re really trying to be cost effective then that\u2019s the route.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, that's fair, my only worry is that with most art-related degrees (like game art) it seems the general path is two years of learning and two years of portfolio development so I'm worried that if I do community college and still try to get a degree in game art I'll have shot myself in the foot by not getting enough time to actually have a good portfolio by the time I graduate which basically determines employability.\n\nAlso, I did Chico's estimate calculator and with the amount that I'll probably be getting from FAFSA (\\~6k most likely) it's looking closer to 75k overall for 4 years. I was mostly just wondering what some people's experiences were like if the estimate calculator is at all relatively accurate. The other comment said less than 20k debt without paying anything off after transferring from community college and if that's possible then I'm a little less worried about 4 years.  \n\n\nMy main goal with college is to get a worthwhile education and not be in debt into my 30s.",

            "comment": "HexIndieDev my friend, Chico State is inexpensive compared to other colleges in California. Why the tuition itself sits at 7k per year. 7k! Thats 3.5 k per semester. Other colleges such as UCDavis has tuition of 14.5k per year! On top of that, housing here is so cheap compared to other places. You can pay as little as 400 dollars a month for housing if you get roommates which many people do, so you won't have a really hard time finding roommates. Check out the Chico State roommate search on Facebook. BTW Game design and game art is the same major here, called computer animation game design major. If you want to live alone, you can see studios from 700-1200. So yeah check out Warner street studios they have studios if you want to live by yourself for like 675 dollars a month.",

            "comment": "Truthfully you\u2019re better off doing a 2 year degree at a Community college. And what you could do is move up here and go to butte college as they\u2019re a feeder school for Chico state. Chico state tuition is roughly $4k a semester not including textbooks. Depending on income of your parents (unless you\u2019re classified independent due to special circumstances) you can qualify for the pell grant, and if you have over I think it\u2019s a 2.5 gpa I think starting your sophomore year you\u2019re eligible for the cal state university grant if you apply for it. I transferred in from a community college from the Bay Area and I\u2019m in my last year at chico state and I\u2019ve only had to take out a total of 10k in loans at chico state (all my grants covered my entire CC tuition) I\u2019m looking at around 15-20k in loan debt by the time I graduate in a year and a half. Community colleges also give out bog waivers, first Gen student grants, and some even have their own school grants. So it\u2019ll really help keep costs lowered. And compared to universities, community colleges allow you to put yourself on a payment plan to pay throughout the semester. And a unit costs roughly $35-45 per unit. I remember I took a single class at butte college (to supplement a class I was missing at my CC) after college fees like health and student gov fees , I paid $210 for one 3 unit class and paid like $50-70 every month for like 3 months. Super doable!  Also you\u2019re better off living off campus as you can get roommates that can bring cost of living down. My bf and I live in a 2b 2ba for 1150 a month so we only pay $575 each for rent then we split electricity and food cost. I have friends who live in 4 bedroom condos with roommates and they pay even less that I do in rent (like 450-500 a month) Also once you move up here by yourself you could also qualify for cal fresh which gives you about $250 in grocery money a month. Chico state was also named one of the top schools for the lowest loan debt and they have very low tuition rates compared to a lot of other schools. Hope this helps! \n\nP.s.\nLook in to butte colleges video game and animation AS degree it feeds right in to the Chico state video game design/animation program. So you\u2019ll get all your GE and lower division stuff for the major out of the way at a low cost, plus most of the professors at butte college actually teach at chico state as well!",

I'll say my one worry has been with many art degrees it seems your first two years is learning and second two years is mostly portfolio development and I know some friends who went to community college and transferred for game art but ended up not having enough time to get a good portfolio because of only being there for two years and thus having employment issues. But if Butte supplies classes for the game art degree path so I wont be behind that sounds like a really good plan! Also, thank you for being so open and explaining the finances clearly, this is definitely some of the best info I've gotten!",

I'm sure your mileage may vary on this. Meet with an advisor at your local community college to see about making a plan for your time there. Spend as many semesters as you can at CC getting all of your GE-breadth courses and anything that can serve for transfer requirements into your major of choice at university. Use [assist.org](https://assist.org) to help with this process. Then transfer and knock out the rest of your degree, and you can definitely graduate with $25k or less debt.\n\nEdit: Would strongly encourage you to choose computer science as your major and get the other two subjects minors, and then you'll be able to pay down your newly acquired student loan debt.",

I'm mostly trying to balance what can make money and what I want to do, while my dream and passion is game design and general game creation I understand it's a very theoretical degree path that might not guarantee a job (with the limited amount of design roles available preferring experience as far as I've seen), and while I've liked the amount of programming I've done I'd personally not want to turn into a low-level coding jockey at a game studio so that's why I've come to wanting to pursue game art as my degree path and hopefully be able to make money and also have some fun with artistic stuff since it seems like there's a lot of environment art positions out there. When it comes to doing computer science tho I'd be most worried about my ability to handle the math portion of the curriculum, since while syntax and stuff is relatively easy for me to get the handle of (at least in C# and Python, hate java lol) I've never been great with math and find it a bit daunting, so if you have any experience I'd love to hear it!",

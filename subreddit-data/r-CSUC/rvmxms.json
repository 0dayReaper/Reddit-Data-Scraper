It\u2019s a beautiful campus and has been identified as one of the best colleges for the money in several reports. \n\nBack in the 80s ( before I went there\u2026 I\u2019m not that old) Playboy did a story and named Chico the #1 party school in the nation. Since then, it\u2019s always had a reputation as a party school. To be fair there are a lot of parties and the are a lot of bars, but this isn\u2019t uncommon for any college town. It\u2019s a solid school and I wouldn\u2019t let the reputation weigh too much in your decision. \n\nBest of luck with whatever college you choose!",

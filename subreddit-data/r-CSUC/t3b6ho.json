    "postText": "Hello Wildcats! I am heavily weighing Chico State as a transfer into BSIS for Fall 2022. I've heard fantastic things about this school and it might even be my top choice right now. (I'm going back and forth between here, SJSU and SLO if I get accepted) Anyways, I really value a good experience from college as the community college I go to right now is primarily online. Some background about me is I would be an 18 y/o (turning 19 Fall 2022) transfer student transferring in junior standing so I wouldn't oppose living with freshmen as I am pretty much the same age as them and have that same crazy energy lol\n\nAs for the housing options, I have received mixed signals about the on-campus housing. I'm confused as to whether the only on-campus housing available for transfer students is the UV apartments or would I be able to pick a dorm on campus? Some people tell me that UV is the only on-campus housing option, while others say they lived in Sutter/Esken as a transfer. Could I get some clarification as to which is correct currently? If UV is the only transfer option I might as well just get a single off-campus apartment for like 1/2 the price right? Any help/input is appreciated, thank you! \n\n~~One more question, would it be possible to get a meal pass even if you live off-campus? Or is it an on-campus exclusive thing? Thanks!~~ (nevermind! this was answered on the FAQ)",

            "comment": "It isn't as much your transfer status as your age. I was under the impression that transfers were always coming in at \"junior\" level, but clearly I was wrong. So they don't want to put a 21 year old roommate with an 18 year old in Whitney Hall for example.\n\nYou can get an off campus apartment, you're not required to live on campus. I don't know the price comparison, but I think it's about $10k for on campus housing, so if you're paying less than $800 a month in rent you're probably getting it cheaper off campus. They fill up quick once people start looking though, so I'd start browsing craigslist or wherever people look sooner rather than later. \n\nTo clarify, UV is owned by the university, but it's not on campus. It's a few blocks away and you'd either have to walk to campus or take the bus. You could drive, but parking is awful near campus, you'd end up walking the same distance from your parking spot as you would if you just walked from UV.",

            "comment": "I was a transfer student in Fall 2021 and honestly, you're better off finding an apartment rather than student-specific housing such as dorms or shared student housing. Though I came to chico with my BF so we live together. But, I have friends that transferred in and they hated living in the dorms because they were older than the freshmen and had to follow all the same rules. There's a bunch of apartments on Nord Ave.  Here's a website for apartments that are for students that are not student-only living places. I have friends that live at some of these properties and they're pretty cost-efficient even if you're living by yourself or get a bigger floor plan to live with roommates.\n\n[https://www.csuliving.com/](https://www.csuliving.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou will get more freedom to do what you want, and if you bring a car you'll be able to park it close to your apartment then in a lot and have to walk a block to your dorm, be able to have people over whenever be able to cook,  ( they have affordable options whether living by yourself or with someone ) or you can search up rooms for rent chico and find roommates.  itll be cost-effective for you or your parents to be either splitting rent with roommates or living in a smaller 1 bedroom all to yourself rather than paying up charged fees to live in a dorm or university-specific housing where you can't do much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you look at the pricing rates for meal plans and housing ( you will pay at least 8-10k a semester just to have a single room to yourself or 5-8k a semester to share a single dorm with 3/4 people) and thats not including the 2-4k a semester meal plan. I live in a 3 bed/2 bath apartment with washer and dryer in unit and a patio for $1300 a month with my bf and our dog and cat . in total thats about 15k a year for rent between 2 people meaning I only spend about 7.5k a year on rent. and chico state offers wildcat pantry if you need help with food and theyll also get you set up with cal fresh and the county will give you about $\\`150-250 a month for groceries on an ebt card. ( though they will give you a higher amount if you live off campus and pay things like your phone bill and electricity) also keep in mind that  lot of apartments around here have leases that start in july/august and then end in May and theyre on what they call a \"college schedule\" since a lot of students dont stay for the summer or they graduate. but you always have an option to renew!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot and sounds like im rambiling but honestly youd be better off finding a real apartment. Hope this helps!",

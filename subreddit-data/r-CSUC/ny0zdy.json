Are students here actually interested in studying, working on assignments and finding a job? \n\nI've talked to a few current students on IG and from what they told me, most people just attend this school for the parties and the drinking reputation. How true or false is this?\n\nI'm planning to do my CS here (because of the reasonable proximity to SF) and found the coursework good enough, so help me understand if this school is good for me.",

They have an interest in graduating and getting a job.\n\nThere is a huge difference between attending Chico State and Graduating Chico State. Most students who go here to solely party drop out by their 3rd or 4th semester. \n\nFinding a healthy work life balance is the key to getting the degree. Those that figure it out tend to do very well in the professional world.\n\nPretty much every CM major I know got offered a full time position before they graduated and had a career waiting to go.\n\nIf you are serious about graduating and building a career for yourself Chico State is a great option. \n\nI\u2019ve spent nights in the library. (Back when they had late hours) working on homework and studying for tests. I\u2019ve worked on Projects with classmates in the Computer lab until 4:30am making sure it got done.  \n\nI\u2019ve also spent late nights at Random house parties and Riley\u2019s drinking cheap beer and rocket fuels and having a great time and making new friends.\n\nChico State was the perfect school for me, I graduate next spring and have a job lined up that I\u2019ve been working towards the last 3 years for. That job opportunity only happened because I learned how to socialize and network at events from my time spent partying here. I got the job and was able to negotiate my own salary and benefits because of the knowledge that I learned in the classroom studying. \n\nChico State is a school where you get the rewards for the effort you put in. As most others here are saying, you are in charge of your future. What you do today will decide what happens tomorrow.",

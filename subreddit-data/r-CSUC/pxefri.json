    "postText": "I submitted my application on the last day of the deadline, but I made sure I got it in. I also submitted my transcripts electronically, but I got an email saying the admissions office was still waiting on one of them and to check my student portal for a to-do list. Submitting my transcripts fell off the list, but I haven\u2019t heard anything and I\u2019ve seen friends of mine start to get their admissions packets in the mail. Should I be worrying yet?\n\nEdit: Got my acceptance email this morning (10/13/21)",

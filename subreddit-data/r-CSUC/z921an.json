My name is Mika Popovic and I am a Graduate student in the CSU, Chico's Master's Program in Psychological Science. I have currently launched a **study investigating the interconnected roles of trait mindfulness, contemplative practice, and religious/ spiritual/ or individual beliefs, in the process of posttraumatic growth**. This study is open to all CSU, Chico students and the general public. This study has been approved by the CSU, Chico IRB committee.\n\nStudy link: [https://csuchico.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_1YSILrFke1jorZQ](https://csuchico.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1YSILrFke1jorZQ)\n\nTo participate, you must be over the age of 18 and indicate experiencing one traumatic event.\n\nTo get there, you can click the link above *or* use your phone to scan the QR code to take you directly to the study.\n\n\\*\\*Please note, all information obtained from this survey will be kept confidential and is completely anonymous\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you can, please complete the study fully so I am able to include it in my thesis, otherwise any incomplete studies unfortunately cannot be used. All that matters is that you respond with your truthful perspectives as best you can. :)\n\nThe study should take approximately 25 minutes, please feel free to ask me anything in the comments or by directly emailing me!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*It includes a drawing of **five $20 gift cards to Amazon** to those who choose to participate and complete the study. If you choose to participate and enter the drawing, you must enter an email for the chance to win one of five $20 Amazon gift cards. Participant's only identifiable information is your email if you wish to provide it. All emails will remain confidential and will be destroyed from the data set following drawing at completion of the study.\n\n*Please note, if you are a Chico State student taking an active Psychology course that offers extra credit, you can sign up on SONA and look for the study titled: The Roles of Trait Mindfulness and Contemplative Practice in the Process of Posttraumatic Growth*\n\nFor more information, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email me at [mkpopovic@csuchico.edu](mailto:mkpopovic@csuchico.edu)\n\nThank you for your time and participation!\n\nMika Popovic\n\nM.A., Psychological Science\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico",

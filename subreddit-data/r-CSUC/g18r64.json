There\u2019s a program within our colleges called NSE, this program allows you to study at another campus for a semester! \nJust curious what you all think of CSUC and if you\u2019d recommend your school? If not CSUC, I\u2019m thinking somewhere in Hawaii, so your feedback is important!!!\n\nThank you!",

And which school will have courses most applicable to your intended career?\n\nBut then again, if you're considering Chico and Hawaii, are you looking at this as more of a semester-long party/vacation than for academic benefit?",

Housing is very hard to find here, so you should just start looking and see if anything sticks. It takes some people several months to lock down a lease on a place.\n\nEdit: But like, if you have the option, try to give yourself a bit of distance from the college. Lots of neighborhoods within about a mile radius of school are LOUD at night.",

Anything west of downtown is fine and after 9th st is good too.\n\nI would avoid east of Nord but anything near the park is great.\n\nGood luck Chico renting is pretty competitive and you gotta move quickly. Its a great town and school.",

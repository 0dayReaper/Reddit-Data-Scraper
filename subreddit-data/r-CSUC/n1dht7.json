It is off-campus but it is still considered \"off-campus.\" It is about a 15 minute walk to campus and the grocery store is essentially across the street from UV. Lived there my freshman year and I took it for granted. We didn't have to report to a front desk or anything like in the other dorms and you definitely have way more privacy. You also get your \"own\" bathroom, sink, and kitchen that you share with your cluster mates. Hope this helps.",

It has the best, \"inviting\" atmosphere. There are lots of food options and high likelihood of finding a table near an outlet.\n\nBrave Coffee has best coffee in town IMHO.\n\nI suspect Stoble will soon open on Mondays now that the college students are back in town. I like that Stoble doesn't blast music that can be distracting and hands-down has the best internet connection.",

I know the owners for both brave and stoble and they are great guys as well! Stoble roasts their own coffee and brave gets theirs from a roaster out of sac, daycamp also roasts there own but stoble and brave are a step better imo.",

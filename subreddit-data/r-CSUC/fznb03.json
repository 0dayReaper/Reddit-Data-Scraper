Unfortunately when it comes to job/internship searching your SOL and the main career center is a terrible resource for engineers. Chico has a very hard time getting Bay Area tech companies because Chico is \u201ctoo far\u201d. The department is trying, but building those kind of connections takes years. I got my internships by just applying online to companies and going to the Technical Career Fair to hand out my resume to the 5 tech companies there.",

I am not much of a partier and I don\u2019t drink, do you think I will still find a social group? Or is that the main activity here? \n\nThank you!",

Joining clubs are a great way to make friends, the wrec is amazing if you like to work out, hiking is close by with lots of trails, and if you are creative there is a maker space near campus where you can do projects. All in all, it's mostly what you make it.",

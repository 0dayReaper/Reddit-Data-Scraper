It's common courtesy and we all have masks now.",

I've had chronic allergies my entire life and dealing with a stuffy nose and the occasional sneeze is a part of my day to day life.\n\nThe last thing I want is to be nannied by a bunch of hypochondriacs who don't understand my situation by forcing such an unrealistic and draconian regulation on me.",

I respect people who choose to wear it and respect those who don't. It shouldn't be mandated if the majority of the student population is double vaxed and boosted. Plus, I have asthma, and climbing three flights of stairs with a mask on leaves me out of breath, and the mask doesn\u2019t help with my wheezing \ud83d\ude05",

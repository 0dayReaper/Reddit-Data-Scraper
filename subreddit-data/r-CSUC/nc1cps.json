I have tons of friends that went to both schools. Chico is a residential school in a compact downtown area, so it is full of students and student-centered businesses. You can walk everywhere, and it is relatively cheaper than Sac. And since most students come from out of town, there are a lot of people looking for new people to meet.\n\nSac State is a commuter school in a kinda boring area of Sac. To live anywhere interesting, you'd need a car (or at least public transport) to get to the campus. Since most people that attend are commuters, most already have social circles. It is a bit more difficult to make friends.",

On campus things are pretty liberal, but as you head away from the center of town things get red. Some frats still fly the Jefferson flag tho.",

Lol earlier last semester they tried to get a professor fired and had a whole ass protest on-campus. I\u2019ve witnessed both homophobia and racism from frat guys, but they\u2019re a group you can avoid. \n\ni\u2019m not familiar with sac state, but i\u2019m guessing it\u2019s more liberal compared to chico. i\u2019d ask r/CSUS the same question.",

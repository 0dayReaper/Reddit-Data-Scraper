    "postText": "I'm looking for a new job, and I'm curious about Impact Marketing. They heavily push that they're hiring, whether it's in advertisements or emails sent to college students. I don't know that I'd want to work as a telemarketer, but I want to hear from people who have worked/currently work there or whatever people know about it. Is telemarketing an annoying job? Is the work environment stressful with a lot of pressure for sales? Good or bad bosses? Flexible work schedule? etc. \n\nAs a student, I'd like a relatively low stress job with flexible work hours. I have other ideas for jobs I may want, but I was just curious about other's experience working in telemarketing. See if it may be a good option for me.",

But there's no commission based work, it's just calling alumni and asking if they'll donate to their major's next big project. You get a list of names and phone numbers, maybe a graduation year or major/minor and start dialing. \n\nYou'll get a million voicemails, then finally a little old lady will pick up and tell you about how much fun she had at Chico State back in 1962. Then she'll write a check for $47 and mail it to you. That's the whole job.",

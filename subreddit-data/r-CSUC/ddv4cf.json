    "postText": "I'm currently a high school senior and I feel we all know the stress during this time of choosing the right college. I've been doing as much research as possible, but I feel like it would be a better idea to just ask people who know the school best. My plan is to get my bachelors in psych and eventually move on to get my law degree. I was wondering of Chico State was a good option for what I want to do. I applied to SDSU, CSULB, CSUC, and CSULA. I don't plan on getting admitted to either SDSU or CSULB, and I feel CSULA wouldn't be a good fit for me. Is CSUC a good option for what I want to do, or would it be better to go to a CC first then transfer into a UC?",

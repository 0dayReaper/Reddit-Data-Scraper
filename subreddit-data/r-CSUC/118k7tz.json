Overall, I have done well in my community college and I am getting my associates degree with honors.\n\nHowever, I am nervous that the honors program classes may be too hard for me at Chico State if I were to apply.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice, suggestions, or experience?",

College is hard, especially if you\u2019re pushing yourself to get the grades required to be in an honors program.",

In many courses, it isn't even necessary to do this to get an A. \n\nI'm not saying that liberal arts education isn't valuable, but the amount of work and difficulty can not be compared to STEM. Anyone should be able to get a liberal arts degree by putting in a minimal amount of effort.",

The main honors program is Public Sociology which is \"How do you interpret social problems to a wider audience\" in the terms of op-eds. \n\nBe sure you received the Honors email from CSUC and not the \"Honors Society.com\" or something. The latter is a scam.",

If you can, invest in Premium Grammarly... It has been the lifesaver on all my essays! \nSocial Stats was my worry in terms of math and it is mostly understanding the SPSS program and basic math.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I am considering transferring to Cal Lu or a CSU and I wanted to know a bit about the program.\n\n1. Do you feel like you learned enough to enter the job market\n2. Was it easy to find internships?\n3. Did you have problems dealing with the party school stigma? \n4. Are there any hackathons or related events? I could not find anything online about it\n5. Did you enjoy your experience?\n6. If you graduated how long did it take you to find a job?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this and for helping me out",

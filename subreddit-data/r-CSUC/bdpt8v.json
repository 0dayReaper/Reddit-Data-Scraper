    "postText": "Hello out there - I'm a big ol' procrastinator and would love to find some people to both get together and study with, and/or do online check ins with to encourage each other to get back/stay on track. If we do meet up in person I do actually want to study at least 3 times as much as chat, although I'm open to getting to know each other and being friendly. Sometimes I set a timer to work for 45 minutes and then take a 15 minute break.",

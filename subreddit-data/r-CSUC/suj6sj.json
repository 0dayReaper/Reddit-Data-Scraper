    "postText": "Hi, I am a student from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, and I desperately wanted to get out of Minnesota and have a change of scenery, so I was thinking about going to CSU Chico for a semester (NSE), so I wanted to hear about what it was like before I commit! What is campus ambience like? How much is cost of living? Is it terribly difficult to get around without a car? I wanted to have a \u2018great college experience\u2019 lol but I\u2019m a bit discouraged because of how far away it is from most big cities. Any thoughts and/or advice would help a lot, thanks!",

            "comment": "It's a great college experience and city.  What makes the college experience unique is that students generally live very close to campus.  So friendships are easy because it is effortless to study together and visit eachother's homes.  The city is gorgeous, filled with trees, nature, culture, and a great downtown area.\n\nMy numbers might be outdated, but to share a 3-bedroom unit will be about $400-$600.\n\nYou can ride a bike to most locations.  Most students use their bike as their primary mode of transit.  There are bike paths and residential, lightly-trafficked roads that go through the majority of the city, which makes biking safe and fast.  The most difficult aspect for me when I was a student was getting groceries, as most of the major affordable grocery stores like Winco are in highly-trafficked areas.  However it is possible to live near Trader Joes which is good for backpack shopping on a bike every few days.  If you have a bigger grocery budget there are several local food co-ops that are accessible.\n\nIf you want to visit a big city, Sacramento and the Bay Area are not far away.  About 90 minutes to Sacramento and 3.5 hrs to San Francisco.",

            "comment": "The only CSUs that have an active social scene are Chico, CalPoly SLO, and SDSU. SDSU is the only one near a big city, but the actual campus is not very close to the beach or downtown San Diego - you definitely need a car to go very far off campus. It's a huge school though so plenty going on. Both Chico and CalPoly are in nice towns, but only Chico is fully walkable - the walk from CalPoly into downtown is at least 20 minutes, and it is similar to Chico in that it is a small cute town, but not near any cities. Your best cost of living will be Chico for sure, but if you are hoping for a big city experience, you won't find it here. Although like others have said, Sacramento is not far.  Chico is a beautiful campus integrated into a very cute town, but it is definitely not a big city vibe if that's what you are looking for. I guess it depends on what you mean by a \"great college experience\" - that can mean different things for different people.",

            "comment": "The cost that you will save in rent in Chico vs most other cities in California- you can put towards transportation to visit those cities. Rent is probably double in most other California college cities (and sharing a bedroom, vs your own in Chico.). A San Francisco visit would have to be a weekend getaway though, or a very long day trip. \nCheck out this page https://www.facebook.com/groups/chicostudenthousingroommatesearch/?ref=share",

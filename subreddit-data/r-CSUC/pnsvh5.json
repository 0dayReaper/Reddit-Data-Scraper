If it's the same professor, the formula to ace all the tests is straightforward.  He will give you a weekly paper with questions related to the chapter.  You can type all your answers in right on the paper.  Then you can use that as your guide when you take the test.  As long as you wrote notes for each question, there is no reason you shouldn't score 100%.  The same rule is true for the final.  I really enjoyed this class and wish I had kept the books.",

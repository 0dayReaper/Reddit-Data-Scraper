I\u2019m a bit upset I won\u2019t get much of the campus experience and to socialize but anyways, what\u2019s the best in your experience? Asynchronous courses or courses w/ lectures? Pros and cons?",

            "comment": "for me it depends...if it is just an elective it is nice to have asynchronous so i don't have to worry about it as much because i can get it done last minute if needed, but if it is an important class for your major then i prefer lectures to have more interaction with the professor and other students",

I would suggest trying to find a job or some kind of work experience to help build your resume and that will be easier with Asynchronous classes.",

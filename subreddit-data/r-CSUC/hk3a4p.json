    "postText": "I went into my student center and just checked my financial budget. It shows the cost of attendance being $19000. It looks like it\u2019s taking room and board in account as well as everything else. However, I plan on living with my parents throughout college so shouldn\u2019t it be around $11000-12000, or does it just automatically factor in everything? Hence the $19000",

Realistically, 11-12k is how much I should end up spending overall which includes tuition, transportation, books/supplies, and personal stuff. Even though I will live with my parents, there is no way I will end up paying 6-7k to live with my parents as the chart suggests. I will end up with money to spare but I will certainly try to rent texts as you suggested.",

Try to sock some of your extra money away if possible - you may decide you need to live on campus later or during grad school. If you\u2019re receiving that much in grants, I almost promise you grad school is in your future.  \n\nIn case you don\u2019t hear this enough - you sound like you\u2019re kicking ass in life!",

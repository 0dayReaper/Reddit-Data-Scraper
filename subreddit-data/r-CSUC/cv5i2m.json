Jacuzzi/pool at the gym fun too. The pool is nice because it has that shallow ramp so it\u2019s easy to chill and talk while wading in the water. Coffee shops are good places too. Walking around downtown Chico always has good people watching. There is ice cream at Bon &amp; Jon\u2019s. The list is endless, pm me for more if you need!",

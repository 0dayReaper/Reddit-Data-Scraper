If you have not for some reason seen anything about this, talk to your department administrator and get signed up on the California website myturn.ca.gov !\n\nAs for the rest of you students in the next few weeks look for information on how everyone up here can get one. Lastly if you have any questions, ask them here and I will attempt to answer them for you! Have a great spring break!",

That's much nicer part of college town. \n\nWildcat Crossing \n\nThe Franciscan \n\nBidwell Ave\n\nDon't listen to these people saying \"dangerous gang territory\". You pretty much wanna look in the West Aves and Downtown. Mangrove/Vallombrosa has nice cute houses, homes/apartments not too far from campus too. Not traditionally thought of as college town but still very close and probably nicer than all of college town.",

Used to be worse. \n\nWest Sac, especially the portion off Esplanade next to Chico High, The West Aves, Nord, South Campus near the train tracks, its all the traditional College Town areas and mostly safe. I mean, I wouldn't walk drunk, alone, 3am through the Aves unless I had to but I wouldn't be terrified. \n\nYeah you'll have some car break ins, yeah someone got killed at 7/11 3 years ago, yeah people get shot or stabbed at parties on Cedar or in the Aves, but I promise you it used to be worse. I was at a party in 2014 on Cedar &amp; 2nd and three people got shot including my friend in the arm. Back in the 90's and early 2000's Columbus was hella poppin with drugs and violence \n\nActual ***gang*** activity you'll find across town in Champantown and even on the Esplanade. Rancheria is like old school. I only ever see the same few tweakers downtown the rest hangout in the park, on Esplanade, under the bridges. \n\nIf you see yourself going to ratchet hood parties in The West Aves, especially off Cedar, then just don't start shit or wear hella blue lol as long as you don't plan on starting shit with gangbangers on purpose you'll be fine to live anywhere in town I promise you. There's not even a lot of gangbangers here and the ones we do have are mostly in Chapmantown.",

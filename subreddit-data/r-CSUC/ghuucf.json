The social aspect is not just partying, that reputation started in 1987 and stuck, it's no longer on any party school lists. If you want that, it's definitely around. It just depends on what you want to get out of your experience.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add, I'm a psych major and my husband's an engineering major",

I wouldn\u2019t say that you need to be an extrovert to get all of the amazing things out of this school, you just need to be willing to dip your toes into things. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a somewhat outgoing introvert. I loved on the honors housing floor my first year and ended up making friends just by existing, laughing at people\u2019s jokes, asking them the basic welcome week questions like \u201cwhere are you from/what\u2019s your major?\u201d Basically, you don\u2019t need to be an extrovert, you just need to be open to all possibilities of friends and activities. There\u2019s so much to do if you\u2019re ready to look for it. \n\nI also agree with the political activism and greek life comments! There\u2019s a small subculture at Chico State for basically every group, from skiers, gamers, writers, anime nerds, partiers, LAX fanatics, political activists, christians, jews, etc etc etc. \n\nYou\u2019ll find somewhere to fit in no matter what\u2014 you just have to be open to it :)",

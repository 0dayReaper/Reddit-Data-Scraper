    "postText": "Hi to all! I\u2019m a senior in high school attending Chico in the fall and I wanted to know what degree would be the best for me to pursue. My end goal is to be a robotics engineer and I don\u2019t know if I should pursue computer science, mechatronics, etc. If anyone is in these majors it\u2019d be appreciated if you could give me some insight.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "First and foremost, welcome! If you haven\u2019t already looked into it, this Saturday is actually Choose Chico day where there are guided orientations and tours and whatnot for incoming or potential students. Lots of on campus organizations will be out and about too so you can talk to students involved with those. As a mechatronic engineering student, I\u2019m inclined to say that\u2019s a much better route than computer science for robotics engineering, but EE and Computer Engineering are also great choices. You can PM me for any more specific questions.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the American Institute of Mechatronic Engineers (AIME) used to do an unmanned ground vehicle robotics competition, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has a few robotics competitions of their own that they compete in.",

But if you check out the website there should be ways to find different clubs and organizations along with contact information so you can reach out to their leadership and ask them some questions. \n\nI am a mechatronics major, and it\u2019s really hard to put a rating on the program because it\u2019s very unique as far as ABET accreditation goes but I am very happy with it. In my experience robotics isn\u2019t a massive part of the program and programming/embedded systems has not been my strong suit, but I feel I have a very good understanding of both mechanical/electrical engineering fundamentals. My involvement with our SAE teams on campus has also given be a good amount of experience with manufacturing and how to make practical designs, which has been really valuable. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth mentioning that our manufacturing technology/sustainable manufacturing major has recently transitioned to \u201cadvanced manufacturing and applied robotics\u201d which may be of interest as well.",

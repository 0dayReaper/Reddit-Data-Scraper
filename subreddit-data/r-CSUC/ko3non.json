    "postText": "Minecraft University is a thriving Minecraft and Discord server that also has lots of gaming communities including: Among Us, Apex Legends, Valorant, Cyberpunk 2077, Genshin Impact, and many more. The server is solely for university students. It is meant to be a tight-knit server with a lot of attention to a classic Minecraft experience. This is a Java server on 1.16.4 and we just started a brand new world recently, so its the perfect time to join in and make something incredible!!!\n\nMake some new friends on this server. We already have over a thousand members and hundreds of active players!!\n\nThe semester and holidays are finally getting over and there is a pretty nice break ahead of us. I know a lot of us can use a break from family, and it's the perfect time to kick back and relax with some games and new friends.\n\nThe Discord invite link is: [https://discord.gg/mcuni](https://discord.gg/mcuni)\n\nThe website link is: [https://minecraftuniversity.net/](https://minecraftuniversity.net/)\n\nStay healthy out there!!!",

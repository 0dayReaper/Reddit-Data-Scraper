            "comment": "I read \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\" by Anne Fadiman for RELS 332 (World Religions and Global Health Issues). It's not exactly 'fun' but it was very enlightening. It explains Hmong culture and the problems western medicine faces when confronted with eastern belief systems.\n\nI also enjoyed \"In Search of the Canary Tree\" by Lauren Oakes. I think it may have been one of Chico's Book in Common in recent years. I love nature and found this one to be very informative and relatively easy to track with. That was for SOSC 300 \"Great Books and Ideas in Social Science\"\n\nI'm staring at a copy of \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" by Jared Diamond. I haven't started it yet (that's my own summer reading project lol). I've had it referenced in probably half a dozen of my classes so far though so I figured it's about time I sit down and read it through. I believe it will become one of my favorites, but I can't guarantee it.\n\nIf either of those first two books interest you, I'd be happy to give them to you (or anyone reading this, just send me a dm). I doubt I'll ever read them again, but I did enjoy them.",

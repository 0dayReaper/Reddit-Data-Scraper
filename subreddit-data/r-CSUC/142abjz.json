The first 2 years will be a 1/3rd of the cost. \n\nTransferring to a CSU is pretty easy, I got into every CSU I applied to. I was a B student, so it's not hard. You'll also have time to visit the CSUs/UCs and carefully pick which one you want to attend. \n\nPlus this may give you time to establish residency which drops the costs significantly. Although the rules on this are very complex.\n\nEnjoy California.",

But not all Community Colleges are created equal, so you might want to research which ones in NorCal have the best transfer rates. \n\nActually, the number of international students tends to be a very good gage here since it means the school has a good reputation abroad.",

Knock out as many 100, 200, and 300 (if possible) level classes as possible.  Physics 1,2, and 3, calc 1 and 2, and diff eq, are all the same regardless of the college you go to. There may be nuances among the freshmen and sophomore level classes in different colleges, but these nuances are insignificant when compared to junior and senior level. The nuances of early clases are especially insignificant when compared to the motor sizing (MECA 486), Machine Design (MECH 340), and Capstone classes that you WILL have to take in your junior and senior year. Early classes are just prep and your true journey begins once you transfer into your junior year.\nI will even argue that going to a CC will prepare you better for your junior and senior level classes through your freshman and sophomore classes.\n\nFinally, it's overall cheaper to go to a CC than it is to go to a 4-year. Cost of attendance in CSUC for out of state is crazy expensive. So overall you're paying less for better prep.",

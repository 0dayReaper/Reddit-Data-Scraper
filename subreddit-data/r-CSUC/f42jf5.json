Asked for a Taper, got no where near what looked like one. Best places to get a bad ass fade is Danny's Barbershop or Gentlemen's Barbershop. Been going to both for 2 years I've been here. Both these place will charge $25 no tip, but u get what u pay for and you know damn well this is regular price in So Cal, hell its rare to find cheap places in LA \n\nI've gone to all barber shops in Chico and both these places have great service and barbers who know what theyre doing. \"Chico's Barbershops\" customer service is ass. No one asks you anything unless u got 30 min in and no one's said anything to you. Up to you bro. Don't believe me then Yelp the reviews. \ud83d\udc88\ud83e\udd19",

If you want a shit cut, best believe I ain't coming back. Getting a good cut is art and takes time. If places take 10-15 min to finish a fade then that barber sure af doesn't know what they're doing. Like I said, I'm from So Cal and competition is everywhere, Chico is starting to pick up but that barber on Nords, shits ass.",

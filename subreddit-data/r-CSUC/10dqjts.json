While he doesn't have a ton of reviews, his ratings are definitely alarming.  Would anyone be willing to share their experiences with him?",

I took his operating systems course and while its hands down the hardest course in the major I still got an A- despite only doing half work on a couple of the projects and getting \\~B on the midterm and final. He is always active on the student discord and you can seek help from him via email and during labs. If your asking for help for a project 2 days before its due I have found he does get pissed off but still will help you. After taking operating systems with him his score should be more around \\~3.5-4 BTW I think the only other section of the mobile course is taught by his wife. So my guess would be they are basically the same.",

So for a lot of students, something went seriously wrong unless they're just all upset about getting low grades.\n\nBy contrast, while Kredo is a tough grader and his Networks class is pretty tough, his reviews are quite a bit better on average, which led me to believe that maybe Dixon received those low ratings for a good reason (not just students getting upset about failing a class).  \n\nAnd on that note, if you did only half work on a couple of Kredo's projects and got B's on the tests, I'll bet it'd be pretty unlikely to get an A-.  So I wouldn't think the low-reviewing students would be too upset about Dixon's grading.\n\nSince it looks like Dixon's the only prof. teaching OS as of now, it's good to hear some positive feedback about him.",

I would give him around ~3.5/5. He\u2019s active in the student discord and piazza, so it\u2019s very easy to reach out to him for help, which is something you definitely want to do if you get stuck. Avoid emailing him at the last minute asking for help. He will still try to help you but he gets annoyed by it.\n\nI think a major issue students have with him is the way he talks to you. When asking him questions (especially questions he\u2019s already answered multiple times), he can act condescending at times and make you feel dumb. I\u2019ve personally never experienced this, but I\u2019ve heard other students have. He will get annoyed when you ask him questions he\u2019s already answered multiple times in lecture/lab/piazza. So yeah, before asking him a question, check to make sure he hasn\u2019t already answered it.",

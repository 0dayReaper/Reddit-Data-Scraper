    "postText": "hey guys! i\u2019m a transfer student starting at chico in spring 2023 and i\u2019ve been wondering how getting/looking for a roommate works in the spring. I think most people get yearly leases starting in the fall so i\u2019m worried that this will make it harder to find a place/a roommate. especially since i\u2019m not looking at anything more than a 2 bedroom with one roommate. should i start looking now? i know of the facebook roommate search groups but they\u2019re all focused on fall housing right now. is it a bad idea to just find a place i like and let them find a roommate for me?",

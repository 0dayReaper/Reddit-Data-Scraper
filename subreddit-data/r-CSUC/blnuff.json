How to use Make files to build C++ programs, including program which contain multiple files.\n\nYou register for classes during your summer orientation.  If you don't attend the summer orientation, you'll get a registration window which will be about 1-2 weeks after the orientation.... so attend orientation even if it's just to register for classes.\n\nYou decide what classes to take by finding the graduation requirements in the catalog, selecting classes which fulfill those requirements, and arranging the classes into an ordering which meets each class' prerequisites and the semester in which the class will be offered.",

They will definitely help for the upcoming semester, but when I went to my orientation there was about 30+ CS students with 2 faculty members to help. \n\nIt was a little chaotic but they did a great job helping everyone and making sure they were put into the classes they needed.\n\nI had already planned ahead and knew what classes I needed for my fall semester so during orientation I didn't need much help and got exactly what I needed. I recommend looking at the course catalog for fall 2019 as well as the CS curriculum to at least have an  idea of what you plan on signing up for during orientation.\n\nI met with Tyson on my own time during the fall and he sat down with me and made a progress plan which I have been following.",

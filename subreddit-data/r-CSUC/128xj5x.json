    "postText": "Was wondering if I could get voices from current or previous Chico state students. Incoming freshman to Chico state. I didn\u2019t see anywhere that Chico state doesn\u2019t allow freshman to bring cars however, it\u2019s heavily discouraged. I live an hour away from Chico so I could easily go home for a day or two. Is the parking situation at Chico bad that I should just scrap the whole idea? I have an electric scooter that I can also use in case I would need to park farther away. Please don\u2019t be mad if anything I say is completely stupid I just don\u2019t know yet lol \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb. ( praying that the electric scooter doesn\u2019t get stolen when I bring it to campus \ud83d\ude12)",

I lived outside of the college sections of town and almost always drove to campus, and never found parking to be terrible. That said - I never attempted to park particularly _near_ campus, either. I\u2019d park on the opposite side of downtown, in the free unlimited parking areas, and just walk over. There are even fewer businesses in that section (around the intersection of 5th and Orient) than there used to be, so parking is always pretty plentiful. Five years of school and never got a ticket.",

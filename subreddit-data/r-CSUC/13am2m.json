Mason was an awesome guy. \n\nI feel that I agree with most people - punishing the Greeks in general is a bit severe.\n\nOn the other hand, there have been at least two deaths involving drinking at Chico State this year. Not only is this frightening, it also does more damage to our reputation. Administration has to respond to these cases effectively. It may not be the Greeks fault as a whole for Mason's death, but what Mason did is not even close to uncommon. I personally know many people take 21 shots on their 21st birthday. People's friends are pushy about it, they don't always care how sick you look. Hazing in the Greek community is like this very very often and lots of people have been caught.\n\nIt seems as though one drinking related death this year wasn't enough for people to pay attention and be responsible with their alcohol. When Mason passed, the administration felt they needed to step in more to wake Chico State students the fuck up. Learn your boundaries and respect others' boundaries.\n\nR.I.P Mason :(",

His blood alcohol level was .34.\nOn Sept. 9, fishermen found the body of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student Brett Olson in the Sacramento River. A toxicology report revealed that Olson, who was visiting Chico to take part in the annual Labor Day float, had alcohol and cocaine in his system at the time of his death.\nOn Sept. 16, 22-year-old graphic design major Carly Callaghan was found dead on the floor of her room by her roommate. A toxicology report revealed that Callaghan had alcohol, morphine and Prozac in her system. The mixture of the drugs and alcohol caused her death, according to Chico police.",

The lacrosse house is too. The sports clubs do just as much drinking AND hazing as the greek system.\n\nAlso, what makes you think that most of the people there were from his frat? Mason was a senior when he joined, he had three years of friends that I'm sure would like to celebrate his 21st with him. He also started the snowboarding club which has over 100 members. You don't think any of them were there? Why isn't the snowboard club coming under scrutiny? Why didn't the snowboard club step up and help him? Or his other friends? Where were they?! Why isn't the bar/bouncer/bartender being looked in to? Blaming this situation on the greek system is a fucking cop out for everyone else that was involved.",

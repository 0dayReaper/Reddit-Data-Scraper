Like, can students go out and at what times, curfews, can people come over or stay over, do staff check inside dorms and how that works, etc. basically anything about how the dorms work and if there is flexibility because I heard it is more low-key and chill at UV...",

But most are fairly lenient as long as you're not not too obvious.\n\nNo curfews, I think there's a rule about a person can only stay over up to 3x in a month or something like that, but it's never enforced... they just don't want anyone moving in who isn't on the lease.   Overnight guests are fine, there's no check-in or anything like that.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a transfer student (Electrical Engineering) that recently got accepted from a handful of schools in Northern California, namely Chico, SFSU, Sonoma, Sacramento and SJSU. I was accepted for the Spring 2022 semester, so time is  critical factor. I'm headed out there tonight to look at the Schools in person. I was hoping that I might be able to meet up with someone from the in the STEM programs who might be able to show me around, answer some questions, or even just point me in the right direction.\n\nI'd love to hear if anyone has experience with the stem program or EE in specific, be it in the form of warnings, tips, advice, etc. I'm also very interested in any comparison between schools. I've heard Chico has a strong STEM program compared to the rest of the CSU's bar Cal Poly, but I also feel like the Bay Area schools would have strong networking opportunities.\n\nThank you for helping me make a choice, I'm suffering from some pretty bad decision paralysis.",

            "comment": "I'm not in engineering, but I was a math major. \n\nIf you're coming to campus, Warner street is the road that goes through the west edge of campus. That's where the engineering buildings are. O'Connell and Langdon are where engineering and computer science classes are held. \n\nAcross the street is the new physical science building. It's brand new, so check that out. Math classes (you'll take them as an engineering major) are in Holt Hall which is on So-Wil-Lee-no Ave. (weird name)\n\nYou can park on Legion Ave and Warner Street on the north edge of campus. There's parking meters there. If you're here during class times though the spots may be hard to get since students will be here for class. The very tall building on the corner of Legion and Warner is a dorm called Whitney hall. It's the tallest building North of Sacramento, you won't miss it. \n\nAll the on campus food is hurting right now with lack of staff, so if you want local food, Mom's (classic diner), Tres Hombres (Mexican), The Bear (burgers), Celestinos (pizza)are all right off campus and good foods depending on what you are looking for. \n\nCheck out the Library next door to the science building, and the BMU (student union building). \n\nThe town is organized pretty well. Everything runs north/south. The roads south of campus are all \"streets\" and the ones north of campus are all avenues. So if someone tells you \"I'm in the aves\" that means they're north of campus. Or \"It's in the streets\" means downtown. The streets along the edge of south side of campus are Chestnut, Hazel, Ivy, Cherry and Orange. They spell out CHICO.  If you're a transfer, you could live on campus, but most transfers don't. Places to live might be along Nord, or in the Aves or in the Streets. \n\nThe student WREC (the gym) is on Cherry and 2nd street. \n\nMy uncle is a civil engineer, he says he would hire a Chico grad over anyone else any day of the week. And if they are a woman they are guaranteed to be hired because that's so rare in engineering. I don't know the other areas of engineering though.",

Chico just built a new science building on campus that is really nice. Chico is going to be more affordable for housing than the other CSUs you listed. Sacramento and Sonoma would probably be the next affordable on your list. Go on the campus tour for the different schools. All of the schools will offer some sort of career fair for networking.",

I don\u2019t want to get specific teachers in trouble for being honest, but would be great if you can post which departments this happened in. I want to write a letter to the chancellor of this is going on. \n\nI\u2019m concerned Chico is following the teachers union and not science to determine opening up campus.",

The frustrating part is that early april/late march, in person classes were limited to 25% room capacity. So we would have had to either have a really small class, or do some finangling with rotating in class time for students. Now, we're allowed larger in person classes, and weve already been asked to update our choices. \n\nThey also pushed registration date back 2 weeks because ALL those classes that are changing need to be updated in the system again. \n\n They really are pushing for all/most freshman math classes to be fully in person.",

But as you said, it seems focused on GE classes, for freshman, who most likely will have all in-person moving forward into 2022. Meanwhile current sophomores will have finished 75% (3 semesters!) of their classes on-line, (having made no real college connections) with limited upper division courses in-person for fall 2021. The inequity is frustrating",

I'm sorry that you missed out on a year of community building. I bet there will be in person activity for all students this fall. I'm planning on hosting DataFest in person again in Spring thats for sure.",

If you are attempting to have a class while some folks may be carrying an airborne disease you can understand why that is a bad plan to have them in such rooms. \n\nTaking all of that into account the instructors for CAGD (from what I understand) decided to not have classes in person with I believe 1 basic freshman course. It makes sense from a student perspective too because most of our projects are group based so that doesn't help either.",

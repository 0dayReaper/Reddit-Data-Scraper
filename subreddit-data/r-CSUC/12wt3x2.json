If you want a dorm experience do that, or find much cheaper and better housing off campus.\n\nThe set up is three bedrooms, two bathrooms, six residents. Each bedroom has a sink and two bedrooms share a connecting toilet/shower. The other bathroom connect the third bedroom and the living room. The kitchen has two fridges. It's kind of grungy, when I moved in the shower was moldy.\n\nThere's a safeway across the street and a bus line directly to campus so transport is not an issue. \n\nYour experience will vary wildly depending on your random roommates. I had roommates I never saw and it was kind of lonely, but my friend's roommates were constantly throwing parties and causing problems. I will say that everybody I know who was in UV went for off campus housing the next semester.",

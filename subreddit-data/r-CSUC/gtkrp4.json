I wonder if they will change the rules and allow transfers with less than 60 units. \n\nAny freshmen thinking of taking CC classes be aware that if you take even one class in the fall at a CC you might not be able to start at Chico State until you have completed 60 units or take a year off and then can come in as a freshman. \n\n\n[This is the current post on the transfer admissions page](https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/transfer/Pages/lower-division-transfer.aspx)\n\n&gt; Due to enrollment demands, most CSU campuses restrict or prohibit the admission of lower-division transfer (LDT) students who have earned fewer than 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter units).",

Are there other Chico students there to help? Or is there somewhere to park and leave our vehicles while we unload them? Any info would be greatly appreciated!",

Try to arrive early and get one of the rolling bins everyone uses to move everything in.\n\nMove all your stuff in, set up a little bit and THEN go to Wal Mart or wherever while everyone else who arrived late moves their stuff in.\n\nChico is an amazing place to go to school.  She will have an amazing time!\n\nGood luck!",

You will be parking on Legion Ave which is pretty small so a line will start that will be there pretty much all day. There will be carts for your stuff, and while facilitating them is usually done pretty well, sometimes it can be hard to find all you need. There will be students to help, A LOT of students.\n\nIt will be hot so bring comfortable clothes and hydration.\n\nMost of all bring patience.\n\nEdit: oh an and as far as Target/Walmart are concerned, they are hit hard and fast",

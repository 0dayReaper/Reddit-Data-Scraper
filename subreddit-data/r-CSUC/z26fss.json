            "comment": "While this is my first semester here, I've had pretty solid 7.5/10 on the queer experience scale.\n\nThe good- haven't really experienced any professors or classmates that won't use my correct pronouns. Sometimes takes a little reminding but never with any pushback or response other than \"oh sorry\". The queer population is also pretty decently sized here due to being a college town and all, though obviously not as large of a community as you'd find in SF or Sacramento. I've not had a hard time at all finding a group of good people to surround myself with. Additionally, if you are medically transitioning the student health clinic manages hormones (only maintaining current prescriptions, not issuing new ones as far as I'm aware). Basically, if there's anything you have an interest in doing, you probably won't be the only queer person there, and even if you are, it won't ever feel \"othering\". \n\nThe bad- Chico is in the middle of nowhere farmland and as a result, the locals skew towards middle-aged to old conservatives. You might get some slight looks walking downtown or whatever but nothing even close to distressing in my experience. Some professors may need... more reminders than others to use the correct pronouns which is annoying. \n\nOverall, very much would recommend it if you're already on board with everything else Chico has to offer. Existing while queer in Chico hasn't felt difficult to me, it's actually felt quite comfortable. \n\nBest of luck",

There is The Stonewall Alliance Center, as well as on campus groups/clubs that focus on LGBT issues/support. In general, the students in attendance at Chico State are friendly and accommodating to all.",

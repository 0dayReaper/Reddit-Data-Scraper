I applied and got accepted- i would just have to tell them my intent to enroll now.\n\nI work full-time and wanted to ask what the workload was like and how fast pace it really is.\n\nI can only imagine doing 2 classes every 8 weeks seems like so much.\n\nAny insight is helpful so i can set my expectations. Thanks",

Some of our classes have been hybrid, meaning some students were in class in person and others were online.\n\nAn 8 week term, with 2 classes, works out the same as a typical 16 week term with 4 classes. That doesn't feel like an overwhelming amount to me, it's just broken into smaller chunks. Winter and summer terms are more condensed (as short as 3 weeks for some of the classes). I took 2 classes during the 3 week winter term and that felt overwhelming. There's no way I could have maintained that level of commitment for very long. Taking those 2 classes over 8 weeks would have felt like a breeze.\n\nI don't mean to minimize your concerns. Your situation is obviously different from mine and your commitments outside of schooling (work, family, etc) will be different and will have an impact on your ability to complete your classes.",

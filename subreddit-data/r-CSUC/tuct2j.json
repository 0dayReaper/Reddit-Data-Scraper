Just an FYI,  Shasta and Lassen are literally identical, so either one of them is good. I still hang out with the majority of my dorm room floor to this day. \n\nWhitney definitely still is the main party dorm, but that comes with a lot of downsides. It's a 9 story building with only 2 slow elevators, so you'll be waiting a lot. And any time someone throws up in the elevator (happens more than youd think) its shut down for a while. On top of that, you'll be evacuating due to the fire alarm going off a lot more in whitney than in other dorms. I believe when I was in Lasses there were like 2 or 3 fire evacuations the whole year and whitney had about 9 or 10. \n\nSutter is probably the nicest out of the on campus dorms, however I found people to be a lot less social there for some reason. It also felt like you were staying in a hotel instead of a dorm due to people mostly keeping to themselves. In lassen, a lot of the times people just left their doors open and you could stop by and hang out / meet people. \n\nUltimately it doesnt really matter too much in the end. I chose Whitney as my first choice and Sutter as my second choice but ended up getting disappointed when the only spot I was offered was at Lassen. It seems like a very major decision, but realistically you're going to have a good time anywhere you stay.",

You can rent a fridge/microwave for your dorm and I\u2019d like $50 for the year. Pretty much everyone did that, and I\u2019d highly recommend it too for when you get tired of sutter dining",

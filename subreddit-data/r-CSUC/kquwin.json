The general course description doesn't mention any programming in like C, but doing some searching on google seems like people actually do coding in this? Any information about this course would be helpful :)",

            "comment": "Yeah I just took it last semester with Wang, and if he is your instructor there is quite a bit of coding in C or C++ . He has four programming assignments and they all seem to build off each other so if you fall behind on one it kinda becomes a nightmare.. but he is an understanding teacher so it is useful to get his help during office hours. Also you do it in pairs so it's nice to have someone to collaborate with as long as they seem interested in working together",

I was wondering if you have any advice for Wang\u2019s class, I\u2019m not bad with C++ but is there anything I should know coming in from another school? I.e: linux stuff, readings, Chico info, even the professor himself or just anything else that comes to mind; because I\u2019m reading his first assignment and I don\u2019t even know where to start (given the semester hasn\u2019t begun so maybe I\u2019m over-reacting) but any info you have would help me be less freaked out/scared...",

The best advice I can give is to go to office hours and make him help you. Also I always wish I had done more pseudocode and design before starting the assignments. Personally I never found time to do the readings and did fine on the tests because much of it was based on Lab questions. Like he'll give you a question on the lab and then just has a bunch of variations of it on the test which makes it pretty simple. If you can, I'd suggest just starting the first assignment now, it'll be a struggle at first but it will click after awhile. If you use C, make sure to use strtok() to split strings . Also recv() and send()? I believe are really important the whole semester. Overall just anything in Beej's guide is super helpful, which Wang will have a link to.",

Thank you also for the information on how to study for tests and such, I\u2019m certain that it\u2019ll help me once the exams come around. I was scared that there was a learning curve but knowing what to expect helps tremendously. I said thank you twice already upon re-reading my message, but whatever, thanks again lol",

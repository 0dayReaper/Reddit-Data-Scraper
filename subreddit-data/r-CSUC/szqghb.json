    "postText": "I understand the desire to make our spaces better, really, I do. Yet, why are they closing the fourth floor of the library for half of one of the busiest semesters? Yes, the signs have alternative places to work, but this campus already lacks tables and collaborative spaces that are accessible to all. \n\nHas anyone even heard or seen the plans that college has regarding the fourth floor?",

The project is scheduled to be completed by August 22, 2022.\"\n\nI heard they are replacing the carpet on the third and fourth from my boss and we are gonna be working remote until it's finished. I wonder if they're doing that along with the rest of the changes. That's why I assumed it was just the carpet.\n\nHere are alternative studying areas the website listed:\n\n3rd for quite study, and study rooms,\n\n2nd for group study, study rooms, and computers\n\n1st floor general study areas, computers, and Research Assistance\n\nother campus spaces for study:\n\nBMU\n\nHFA Lounge\n\nScience Building Lounge\n\nSylvester's Cafe Area",

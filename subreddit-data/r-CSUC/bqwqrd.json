She said it's smaller than the MFT program but because the other psychology grad programs filter you into specific jobs whereas the MA is more of a stepping stone into a PhD program, that the MA program is a bit easier to get into.",

I was in Chico this last weekend and I like the environment which made me think of it as one of the schools I would want to attend.",

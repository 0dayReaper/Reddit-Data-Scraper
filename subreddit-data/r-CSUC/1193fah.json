    "postText": "I am an international student applying to Chico for BS in CS. I received my Chico State ID today and was looking through the document instructions, and it says English proficiency (ielts/TOEFL) there aswell. My question is can I send my IELTS score later to Chico State (after my acceptance letter or maybe later so i could upload all the other documents right now, leaving only the IELTS score). Also is the document deadline till the application deadline or is it different? Please help since whenever I search document deadline , I only see results for official transcript and application deadline.",

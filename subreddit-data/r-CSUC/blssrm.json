Both routes go the same way but the narrow path is slightly shorter, so skateboarders often go that way. This narrow path is almost always crowded with people, so they weave right through the crowds. There are \"carry boards\" signs on that path, so it's supposed to be prohibited there. I posted this after some guy on an electric board came from behind and zoomed past at very high speed and was inches from hitting me while I was on that path. Scared the shit out of me.",

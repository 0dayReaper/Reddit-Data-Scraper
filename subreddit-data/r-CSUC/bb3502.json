I usually leave it there for morning classes until and then nights if I have a group project or event to go to. I never leave my car in the lot overnight though.",

There are a lot of poor, drunk, and/or homeless people who will happily smash your window if your dumb. \nThe dumbest this I saw was someone threw an office chair through the back windshield and then ripped the aluminum off the doors, but it never got moved and then someone lit the back seat on fire a week or so later, so it was probably abandoned.",

Keep in mind, it was an older model Honda, which are infamously easy to break into and hot wire. It also wasn't near campus when it was stolen. However, if you have an older model popular car, I'd recommend taking extra precaution... maybe an aftermarket alarm or The Club or something along those lines that might encourage a tempted criminal to move to the next car.",

I haven\u2019t heard of any too bad of stories other than people leaving an ipad, for example, in the front seat of their car and it getting stolen. As long as your smart , no one really has a reason to vandalize your car unless it\u2019s to steal something.",

I honestly don't even know how they knew it was there because my windows were tinted, it was dark out, and I hadn't opened up the doors or anything for a while so nobody would've known it was there. But it still happened. I grew up on the east side of Chico and never worried about things like that, but when I moved closer to campus so I could walk to class, my truck was broken into within a couple months.\n\nThe rule of thumb is don't leave anything sitting out in the open in your car. People will bust in for the dumbest things, so make it look as empty as possible.",

Seeing as everything will be online, and that I'm struggling with my online Macro Econ summer class at my local college, I thought maybe we could all help each other rather than going in blind and then not remember anything come winter break.",

Due to the psychology job market being rather terrible unless you do grad school, I\u2019m thinking about switching over to CAGD but have no prior experience doing any sort of development/animation. I genuinely enjoy the idea of game development. Should I start tinkering before switching so I know what I\u2019m getting myself into or do they expect you to know nothing?",

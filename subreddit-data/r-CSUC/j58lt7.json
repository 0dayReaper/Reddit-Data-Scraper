            "comment": "The program is outstanding. Mostly because it is one of the few at CSUC that actually have recruiters come and offer internships. The department has free copying, paper for resumes and is just all around helpful to students. That may have changed with online-only but I still see the companies recruiting so I know that is still happening.\n\nIt is almost impossible to not have a job offer after graduation and you will actually have real stuff on a resume and things to talk about at interviews.",

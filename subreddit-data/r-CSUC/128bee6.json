It\u2019s called Lower Division Transfer.  It\u2019s listed on every CSU application.  Higher profile schools tend to only take students with more units because they are more selective with their applicant pool.  But any of them can take anyone after those 6 units.",

If you only want to focus on your academics, most of the professors are great and the classes are so small that most of the times they\u2019re willing to directly work with you if you go into their office hours, and they\u2019ll usually learn your name if you\u2019re active in class. If you want to get involved in clubs and extracurriculars, it can be a bit difficult at first since most of the clubs here suck at outreach and you pretty much need to hunt them down, but once you do, it\u2019s totally worth it. And of course, the infamous party scene. It\u2019s nothing like it was in the 80s and 90s, but if you live in the dorms, ask around and there\u2019s a 99% chance someone has a Snapchat group chat for all the info on the parties for the week and what not. As for the town, if you like the more rural setting and are a big fan of outdoor activities like hiking and rafting, or you just want a break from the city life then Chico is great, but if you want to go to a school in a bustling town where you have 1000 different options to spend your free time, then Chico isn\u2019t it. And finally, socializing is key. Since there is so little to do in Chico, if you don\u2019t make friends you will get really bored, hate every second here, and probably go low key insane. I would recommend reaching out to your friends back home and seeing if any are going to school in Chico, and if they aren\u2019t then start looking around on Instagram or Snapchat trying to find people to become friends with, cause trust me, it\u2019ll make your college experience 10x better!!!",

To add to this a bit; even though they share admissions results by May 1, it is most likely sooner that you will hear back. There is a priority deadline for admitted students signing up for housing. That is April 15. (This is probably to get people to commit sooner than later.) If you sign up for housing and get in your $300 housing deposit by April 15, then you will be part of a pool that will have first consideration of which dorm you want to live in. (You rank five choices). They are closing one of the dorms because it isn't functionally safe.",

All of the on-campus housing sucks. Shasta and Lassen had a rat infestation last year and Konkow Hall is currently being used to host students infected with Covid-19 while non-infected students still live there- it\u2019s a different floor but they share ventilation. And the other buildings aren\u2019t much better, Butte Hall is currently being replaced by a new building for the college of BSS due to a black mold problem, yet they\u2019re still actively hosting classes in the building.",

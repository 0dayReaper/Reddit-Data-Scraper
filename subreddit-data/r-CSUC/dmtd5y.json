What is the campus life like and how are the professors? Is it expensive? Honestly, any information or personal thoughts about the school life would be great. I've seen virtual tours of the campus and have read some reviews about it. It looks like a a great place to be, I'm just a really indecisive person.",

You will be surprised how many employers look for graduates from Chico because you get plenty of hands on experience through labs and projects both in and out of class. \nChico is a small town with a whole lot to provide as far as a vibrant downtown and a school that has been rated as one of the more valued schools in the US as far as engineering goes. If you play music, there is also a great music program which would love to have more students involved.",

CSUC makes most students become pretty social. \n\nI\u2019m current in the nursing program and graduate next fall. I don\u2019t plan on having any trouble finding somewhere to start my career. Chico State may be a school with a party reputation, but DAMN we have amazing academics...",

            "comment": "Mechatronics Major here. Honestly the program is really great. Obviously there's a lot of work, but if engineering is interesting to you and a legitimate passion, then it won't be a problem. Some of my GEs were actually harder than my major classes becuase they were just so boring. As a mechatronics major you'll take a wide variety of engineering courses such as mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and computer science. The only problem with that is that it's a bit tricky finding other mechatronic engineers in your class as a mech engineering class is mostly filled with mech majors and Compsci classes are mostly filled with Compsci students. The dedicated major classes are more upper level. If you put the work in and go to class it shouldn't be a problem. The social life in Chico is great too. And if you like partying there's sure a bunch of that up here",

Definitely one of the best true college towns in CA and on the west coast. Everything is basically centered around 1 square mile of campus, south campus, and downtown which is all walkable. And due it being in a small town it\u2019s dirt cheap compared to other states schools or UC\u2019s. Professors aren\u2019t too bad, some are amazing some aren\u2019t.",

CSUC is an excellent school. They have an impressive graduation rate and the engineering departments are amazing. Recruiters come to the school constantly to hire engineers. The faculty is great and are truly invested in your success. Chico is a great town that is having some growing pains but overall is safe and easy to live in. I highly recommend visiting the campus and spending a few days in Chico to see if it's a place you might enjoy. I love the campus size and the area, but you might be more at home in a bigger or smaller city for example. I hope this helps inform your decision!",

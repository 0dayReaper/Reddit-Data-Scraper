Pretty good location for class, downtown, parties, etc. The only negative was the WiFi; I literally got better reception on the toilet than in my dorm room. So if that issue has gotten better, then I have nothing but positive things to say about Shasta!",

Just the right size where you will recognize everybody by face if not name. I'm still friends with the people I met there. Very tight knit community.",

I live in Lassen and really enjoy it, really social and not super crazy, less than 5 fire alarms from the whole school year. You may wonder are fire alarms really an issue; yes! Especially if its Whitney or Sutter, 8 floors worth of people and they aren't just smoke detectors they are particle detectors which means if a girl puts on too much hairspray the whole building will have to be evacuated. Happen literally every week. Every dorm hall is social, Whitney and Sutter are just an extra step above because they are filled with freshman trying to party and drink. Lassen/Shasta are considered quiet because no one is bumping super loud music or trying to throw a mini party in their room.",

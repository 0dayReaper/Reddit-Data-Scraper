How if registration begins until 2pm? yesterday they were not on waiting list, how much of a chance do I get of getting those classes? Do I begin all over??",

Others signed up for the class while you had them in your cart.  \n\n\nDepending on how far down the waitlist you are, you should be fine. Ive had classes where I was #6 on the waitlist but still made it into the class.   \nI would work towards getting as many of your classes that you can that are open and not waitlisting, and leaving the ones that have a small waitlist. It is very likely that if you attend each class the first week or so and talk with the professor that you will be let into the class. This isn't foolproof and you may end up not getting exactly those classes, but thankfully you'll be able to add other classes for the first two weeks of school.",

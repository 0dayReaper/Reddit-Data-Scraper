    "postText": "Hello. I got admitted to Chico for fall nursing. I really like the college town and from what I have heard downtown is lively and of course there are some good parties. But I feel like 17,000 people isn\u2019t a lot compared to other universities and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t meet a lot of people that I like. Am I just overthinking it \ud83d\ude25",

            "comment": "I went to Chico about a decade ago and I loved it. \n\nYes, it has a small town feel. When I was there, pretty much the entire town revolved around the university, so even though it was a small town, everywhere you went you saw people your own age. \n\nThere will be parties. I know they have cracked down on this, but Chico will always have that 'party school' image associated with them and students will continue to go there to party.\n\nIt's still a university though, you can go to Chico and get a quality education, while living it up in your college years.\n\nCampus is beautiful. I was in the area two years ago and it's changed A LOT since I was there. Lots of money has come in so some boozie apartments went up, campus has added a ton of fancy buildings, and the creek running through campus is a lot more landscaped (it was very rugged and natural when I was there.)\n\nYou aren't going to have a ritzy clubbing life or run into any super-rich in the nightlife scene, it is much more college and country focused. \n\nI'm sure you will meet some wonderful friends and some people you don't like, this will be true at literally any college campus in the country. \n\nWhen I was there they had about 10,000. It's not big, but you don't really notice because the size of the city is so small, so all you see is college students. UCLA, USC, Berkeley, and other uni's in large cities are diluted unless you are on the campus itself. \n\nFeel free to ask more specific questions and I will try to help! But I loved my time at Chico, I could have gone to a large university, glad I choose Chico.",

            "comment": "You find your niche once you get there. Dorm living was how everyone was able to find their initial friend group. That\u2019s the same with every single college. \n\n\nI never joined Greek life, but some peopled loved it and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad, I just couldn\u2019t afford it. All frats and sororities had some interestingly bad reputations associated with them for whatever reason. \n\n\nOnce you get there you\u2019ll be able to join whatever group you would like. If you love school then you can join as many study groups or clubs that you can. Are you multicultural? You can get into clubs once the club week comes to table. Love the outdoors? You can get into those clubs, but also, there is little else to do outside of being in the City and most people go check out all the swimming holes at lower or upper Bidwell park, one mile (google it it\u2019s a sick ass natural public pool), bear hole, the Sacramento River for floating. Want to get into the underground rave/house scene? Peking\u2019s basement and Submerged Sessions at The Beach are really fun. \n\n\nAll the bars have different vibes. Riley\u2019s is your classic frat vibe. The Bear is less fratty and has a mix, U-Bar is more low key in their basement vibe and was always my fave. Argus was the mature people bar which you warm up to once you\u2019re in your last year honestly (it\u2019s more expensive). Duffy\u2019s was a locals spot with older people as well. \n\n\nThe local coffee shops like the Naked Lounge had such a good vibe for studying and they also host local shows after dark. Other bars that host local talent include all the other bars I mentioned aside from Riley\u2019s and the Bear. \n\n\nThe things that convinced me about Chico were the tuition cost, rent cost, small town vibe, college program, nature, and the party aspect as well. It was cool to be able to walk to school and bike to a friends house. The fact all students lived in these sick ass Victorian houses was fucking nuts to me and you get used to the local names for the grandfathered down \u201cfamous\u201d houses. These houses have been called the same name since the 70\u2019s. I loved my experience and I couldn\u2019t imagine going to college anywhere else. I didn\u2019t need any convincing, I really was just trying to check boxes. Ultimately, the choice is up to you and you probably know deep down that if you need to be convinced, that school isn\u2019t the choice for you.\n\n\nI met the person that I thought was the love of my life there. It didn\u2019t work out, but I still love him and most of my friends found their now fianc\u00e9\u2019s there. \n\n\nFor reference, I graduated 2018",

            "comment": "If you are joining the nursing program, I assume you are around 21?  After doing a couple years of biology or similar?  When I turned 21 I didn't go to parties anymore, except for parties at my friends' apartments and houses.  We went to the bars instead of house parties.  Furthermore,  I think in a demanding program like nursing you will be more constrained on how much time you have to party.  However, the bonus of this is that your high work load between you and your fellow nursing students will result in a tight-knit relationship.  I did engineering, we studied almost all day every day.  But we spent so much time studying together we became best friends with one another.  We mostly all moved on after we graduated, but it was the best group of friends I had at any point in my life.",

You\u2019ll never even get close to knowing anywhere near all of them and you can find a niche. \n\nI went for 5 years there, left with 2 degrees and a study abroad semester, then took a job at a badass software company In town, and bought a house there and now live in Denver with another house. I lived in chico for 11 years total and don\u2019t regret a single moment of it. I think you\u2019re overthinking it and the fact you\u2019re aware of your mindset is a good thing - it\u2019s tough now with covid and I don\u2019t know your age, but if you can live in the dorms it\u2019s highly worth it.",

The parties are fun but the bars downtown are the way to go if you're of age (plus COVID, maybe don't go to parties). 6th year at Chico State and loving it",

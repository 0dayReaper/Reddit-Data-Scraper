You'll drive yourself nuts.  If this is a deal breaker you need to find like minded roommates. \n\nPick your battles.  You can't have it your way all the time.  Figure out what your #1 thing is and ask your mates to honor it. \n\nMake it clear that everyone has the right to do their own thing... but when someone else's choices begin to affect others   \n\\-  they have every right to speak up and ask for a change.\n\nYou have to be capable of having difficult conversations with people you know/like. Dirty dishes, stolen cloths, rotten food in the fridge, stolen booze, used condoms in the bathroom... whatever the issue - if it makes your home feel less relaxing you have to speak up.",

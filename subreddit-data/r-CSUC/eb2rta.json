The tutor also doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be. She gave us a study guide, but based on how previous tests have gone (class average was in the 40s for 2 of the 5 tests) there\u2019s no telling what is gonna be on the final. Can any previous students shed some light on this final? What should we expect? Thanks.",

I question the legality of this but don't have time to do real research.\n\nAnyway, moral of the story is none of the accounting professors are actually there to spread knowledge, they're there because they thought teaching a course would be an easy cash grab pitstop in their careers. If you're a business major, the only important thing you're gonna learn from them is that it works",

I've heard some pretty unnerving things about The Urban and saw Campus Walk as an alternative at seemingly the same quality. Is there anything worth noting about Campus Walk or other alternatives I could look into? Any input is appreciated.",

It gets tiring after a while for sure.\n\n**The ugly**\n\n* I've heard people have had issues with a particular staff not doing their job correctly, not owning up to it when asked, and resulting in a few days down the drain trying to fix it\n* There is a bit of a parking crisis over here, as being a resident doesn't guarantee you a spot; people stay in the guest parking and loading zone for months at a time\n* The noise is sort of a deal-breaker for some; I know that we're known for being a party school, but the ambient noise of being less than a block away from the train tracks as well as whatever party is going on near you is a bit too much for certain people.\n\nIn the end, nowhere is perfect.We're in a housing crisis.",

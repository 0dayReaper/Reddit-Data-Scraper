I\u2019m in grad school now and I had way more lab skills when I started than a lot of my peers who went to Ivies. Just know that it\u2019s highly unlikely you will be able to transfer over and finish in one year. Micro is one of the most unit-intensive degrees at the school, and when I was there some courses were only taught every other year. \n\nAlso [the bio dept is a mess right now](https://edsource.org/2022/chico-state-professor-disciplined-for-student-affair-allegedly-threatened-colleagues-who-complained/682154) if you haven\u2019t heard.",

It was essentially going to be the same thing at the other school except that courses over there required prerequisites for other courses that were only offered the same semester\u2026\n\nAside from mycology and parasitology, they seem to offer every course I\u2019m looking into w/ a lab component with moderately sized classrooms. Some schools try jamming in 150 students for lectures w/o offering enough labs to accommodate that.",

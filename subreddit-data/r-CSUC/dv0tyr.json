I would be moving from SoCal to attend so if anyone would like to tell me their opinions and if the school is worth moving 7 hours for? I will be applying as a Psych major! Thanks! Edit: I would be living in the dorms so if you have any feedback on that too",

            "comment": "It is definitely worth it. Chico is an awesome town, and one of the only true \"college towns\" in California. Everyone is super friendly, the professors are really good, and the campus is by far the most beautiful campus in the state. I am from the bay area so I only had to drive 4 hours to get there, but I would drive 7, 10, 15, etc hours if I had to because my experience there was so awesome and I wouldn't trade it for anything. \n\nI lived in the dorms (Whitney hall) my freshman year, and some of my best friends today are people I met in the dorms. \n\nThere is a lot to do in Chico even though its not a very large town, especially if you like the outdoors. The party scene and bar scene (for when you turn 21) are great, but there is plenty of other stuff to do (and like minded people to do them with) if drinking isn't your scene. \n\nPlus, the changing of the seasons (there are 4 clearly defined seasons in Chico) will be a nice change from SoCal.\n\nI hope this helps in your decision! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!\n\n \u2014Class of 2018 alumni",

Strong in Business And Agriculture and possibly Engineering but I\u2019m not so sure, plenty of stuff to do whether you\u2019re into partying or not both types of people will find plenty of friends and activities.

            "comment": "I really enjoyed my time at Chico State. I'm a local Chicoan and did my freshman-sophomore years at Butte College, then transferred in as an upperclassman. I was a non-traditional student and graduated in December, 2017.\n\nEven with rising tuition costs, Chico State is still one of the more affordable schools to attend. Most of the programs are excellent with a lot of talented faculty to learn from.\n\nMy sister double-majored in English and Psychology and then went on to get her Masters in Psychology. She was hired out of that grad program by one of the faculty members to work with his mental health consulting nonprofit. She loved the experience from Day 1 of undergrad through her Masters graduation and she speaks highly of the psych program, so if you get in I think you'll enjoy it as well. I've known several people who've gone various routes through the Psychology grad program: MA in Psych, MFT, etc.\n\nHere's the tricky part: the living situation for students has gotten more, shall we say, cramped. A year ago we had a massive fire which burned down a whole town of about 30,000 people 15 miles east of here. Roughly 20,000 of them moved here and many of them took over some of the off-campus housing that students usually move into if they're not living in the dorms. So if you're in dorms your first 1-2 years you'll be fine, but usually juniors and seniors move off-campus and the present situation will really complicate things for you. That's not to say it's impossible, but you really have to plan your moves ahead of time. Also, if you're on a budget, that becomes harder as well because the influx in residents has really driven up rent costs.\n\nAs far as dorms go, virtually each building has a different reputation (i.e. Whitney Hall is more of the party dorm where Sutter Hall tends to be quieter; Lassen, Shasta, Concow, Mechoopda, and Esken Halls tend to fall somewhere in between those).",

The school is \"only\" about 7k/yr without aid, and you get to meet great people in an awesome environment. Chico is one of the few towns where you can actually make enough to pay your rent (with a few roommates) reasonably with a part time job as well. I paid $400 a month last year. If debt isn't an option at all then that's fine, but I think the experience is worth the extra money. \n\nCollege is worth a lot more than what you learn in class.",

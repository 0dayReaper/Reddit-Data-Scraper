Put in some effort (it's your senior year, so still enjoy yourself) and you should be able to get a C no problem. You're about to go to college, so get in the right mindset.  Don't count yourself out too early. You're already seeking advice on the internet, so go find some calc help. Reddit, Khan academy, etc. Good luck.",

Which i believe is true but AP is a grade above so like if you get a b in an AP class if should equal out to an A in a regular class. Depends on your school.

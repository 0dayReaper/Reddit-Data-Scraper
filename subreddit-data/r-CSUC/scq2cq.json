    "postText": "Everytime I go looking for food around lunchtime (let's say noon), the places here are either out of food, or closed. Specifically the BMU and Creekside. \n\nWhat's up with that? \n\nCan the school not keep these places employed or stocked? Or is it something else? If there are better places to go... What are they?",

            "comment": "The BMU marketplace is just such terrible quality for the price that they've pretty much driven everyone off campus to private vendors. I don't know why this is; maybe it's because AS laid off almost all their student staff and now can't hire them back or maybe whoever manages campus dining in general is just terrible at their job.\n\nRemember the deli? Well now it's go to Konas. Remember the fountain drinks in the marketplace? Well now it's go to 7-Eleven. Remember the Chipotle style burritos?  Now it's better to buy it from the guy who runs the food cart at Warner &amp; W 1st. His stuff is way cheaper and just as good.",

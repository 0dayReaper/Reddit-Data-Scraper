Also depending on the type of classes they are and what major you are you can just take 18 for spring then finish up the last two classes over summer (if offered) or if they\u2019re offered online take it over fall 23. I\u2019m graduating fall 23 but I\u2019m walking for grad spring 23\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re a stem major it might be harder to convince because of labs . If you\u2019re a business major or liberal arts it may be easier to convince. Business and liberal arts should be easiest to convince and they have the most options for online courses",

So it 100% depends on what the classes were. \nThere was also a semester that I had two classes that overlapped and had permission to be enrolled in both and leave the first before it ended to make it to the 2nd. \n\nIf you are sure you can handle the load I\u2019d see an advisor so they can help with the petition to make sure it goes through.",

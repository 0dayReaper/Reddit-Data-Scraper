I\u2019ve driven by Riley\u2019s before and there\u2019s always a huge line outside and the patio is packed and no one is wearing masks. Please stop going out in these large groups. People our age need to start taking it seriously. Just because it hasn\u2019t affected you and you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get sick that bad from it doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t cause serious harm to others. It\u2019s making me lose faith in our generation when people can\u2019t give up partying to protect others. It\u2019s selfish and it\u2019s keeping everyone from being able to return back to regular lives because people need to drink.",

            "comment": "CSUC has a few career fairs each year, some of which are geared specifically for tech students, where reps from dozens of companies will show up.  CSUC students have been known to get hired at pretty good companies right off the bat, Google etc.  The program is rigorous and career-oriented and the teachers are grounded and easy to get along with.  \n\nIt's also well worth noting that class sizes tend to be pretty small so it's easy to get in touch with profs and ask questions, which to me is one of the most valuable aspects of college -- having people whose job is to sit there and answer every last one of your questions.  \n\nI love it here, and think it's a great program.",

That might not reflect entirely on the CS program itself but our CS program did make me a lot more competent in my skills and helped push me to learn things on my own. All the professors there are great as well and only want to see you succeed. I'd say pick Chico, but I am a little biased ;)",

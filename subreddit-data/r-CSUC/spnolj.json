    "postText": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m currently a junior in HS, but I took some college classes and could graduate this semester without going to highschool in my senior year. I want to go to Chico( or any uni), but I don\u2019t know how to apply. Does graduating early affect my chances on getting accepted and also is the applying process different if I want to go to Chico instead of my senior year of hs.",

There\u2019s way more to going to a 4 year school than having enough credits. A community college might be a better fit for your general Ed.",

I took a shit ton of different classes. I think all in all I have something like 120 cc credits. I paid exactly zero dollars in tuition fees during my time there. But! I learned so much about myself and matured greatly as a student before transferring to Chico. I now have a grad degree and am looking into PhD programs.",

            "comment": "Chico State doesn't have applications like you traditionally think of for universities. You don't need an \"about me\" essay or a resume or any of that stuff. [Cal State Apply](https://www.calstate.edu/apply)  allows you to apply to any of the CSU schools in California. It's the same application and you just check the boxes for each school you want to apply to.\n\nIf you are low income or other under-represented groups you can apply for free.\n\nChico State (and I think all CSUs?) only take your GPA and standardized testing scores and plug it in to a formula. Everyone gets a score from that formula and the university will say \"anyone with a score over X gets accepted\" the score isn't the same every year because sometimes there's a lot of applicants and sometimes there aren't.\n\nThey won't care if you graduated early, took all AP classes, were previously the CEO of Google, or whatever, just GPA and SAT scores. (AP does affect your GPA though, so that only matters in that it bumps your GPA if you have a 5.0 for example). \n\nAfter you're \"conditionally accepted\" they will double check that you actually did graduate school, and that you didn't get straight F's in your last semester and therefore not actually get the GPA requirement. As long as that checks out you're good to go.\n\nRight now, we're basically accepting everyone. (I don't work in admissions, but I hear everyone talking about it on campus).",

    "postText": "I am a transfer student enrolled for Fall 2019. I know it may be too soon to become an RA but I want to become involved with the wellbeing of my future neighbors. As an extrovert, I have good communication skills and I have experience supervising. I will be placed in University Village. If anyone knows the process on how to apply to become an RA please let me know, along with any tips and advice. Thank you!",

            "comment": "No offense but if your primary concern really is being involved with the wellbeing of your neighbors being an RA isn't _really_ the job to do that. None of the residents like the RAs shutting all the fun down. If you want cheaper housing though that's a different story. Whatever you decide is the best choice for you, information on how to go about becoming an RA can be found [here](https://www.csuchico.edu/housing/current-residents/Become%20A%20Resident%20Advisor.shtml)",

You also need a 2.5+ gpa. The second step is to apply in December. You can apply on Handshake, which is the platform that csu chico uses for all jobs.\n\nIf they like your application enough, you\u2019ll go to 6+ \u201cworkshops\u201d in the spring, during which they will evaluate you and decide if they want to hire you. Lastly cones the group interview, and after that a one on one interview.\n\nSource: Applied but didn\u2019t get in.",

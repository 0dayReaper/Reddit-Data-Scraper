    "postText": "I'm currently looking for someone to renew my lease with me at Pine Tree Apartments starting in August and it is also available to sublet from my roommate right now if that suits your needs. It's a two bedroom 1.25 bath (I have my own sink but shower and else is shared with an additional sink that's yours) refurbished unit that was brand new when I moved in last year. WASHER AND DRYER IN UNIT ITS GREAT. It's a nice, quiet upper unit apartment with plenty of good parking and I have not had any problems. I like to keep things pretty clean and like to cook for myself. I am currently a sophomore computer science major. Feel free to message me with any questions Linked is the description page for the unit. Carpet is in bedrooms only.

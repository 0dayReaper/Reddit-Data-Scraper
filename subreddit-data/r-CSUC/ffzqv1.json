As a result with hard work you\u2019ll get a better grade, increasing your chances in the nursing program.\n\nSome professors are more approachable in office hours, teach more thoroughly, etc.\n\nWith that said I\u2019m not on honors but I\u2019ve heard priority registration is the main perk and it\u2019s not a hard program.",

If you enjoy constantly being social, and don't mind a loud environment until like 2 in the morning then Whitney will be fine. There are also a TON of fire alarms that go off in the middle of the night that leave you out in the cold for 30-45mins.  Sutter is a lot more quiet and if I could do it again I would live there. You being an honors student I would assume you are going to take school seriously and might enjoy the environment there. Plus the amount of fire alarms are WAY less than Whitney.",

    "postText": "I keep seeing posts from people who are either lonely and looking to meet people or who are bored and looking for things to do. \n\nTo both those subsets of people I say come learn to dance! \n\nEvery Wednesday in YOLO 213 the ballroom dance club meets. It's free and you don't need to know what you're doing at all (we would LOVE to teach you). \n\nAdditionally, if you're looking for something off campus there is an AWESOME group that meets at the Chico Guild Hall off Nord and East every Thursday night to dance West Coast Swing. It's only $6 for students so pretty affordable. Here is a link to their FB page.\n https://www.facebook.com/CreativeEdgeWestCoastSwing/\n\nFinally, Saturday the 14th of this month (September) there is going to be a mixed ballroom dance at 707 Wall Street (formally Studio 1, now The Hotha House). There will be a level 1 jitterbug swing lesson at 7pm ($10 and includes the dance after) and a social dance (only $7 if you dont attend the lesson but I suggest you do as it will probably be taught by Luke and he is great). \n\nRegardless of what you pick dance is a really fun way to meet people and if you take one of the ballroom dance classes it's essentially a free A. :)\n\nEDIT: I feel I should mention that the Ballroom dance club meets from 7pm till 8pm on Wednesdays.",

Creative Edge (public welcome) is strictly West Coast Swing. \n\nAnother option that will SOMETIMES have Latin would be 5:30 ballroom (public) also at the chico guild hall but on mondays. You can read more about them at the link. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/530GuildBallroom/\n\nAdditionally you may have some luck at Downtown Dance (local business and open to the public) but I don't go there so I don't know what their offerings are beyond west coast swing on Fridays.",

West Coast Swing is really popular, salsa is common, NC2S, Tango, Cha Cha, Waltz, Bachata, sometimes samba, foxtrot, country two step, jitterbug, east coast swing, Street Hustle, and a bunch more. \n\nThere are also two more days to add the level 1 ballroom dance class! KINE 113 is a hell of a lot of fun and both teachers (Tom and Kat) are excelent. You should give it a look!",

Intermediate might be more your speed (KINE 114) but likely will also be a bit easy. Sadly that's the highest level offered so I'd suggest it anyway. Worst case you'll still meet a lot of great people and can practice technique.",

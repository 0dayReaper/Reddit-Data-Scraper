There are a few fraternities over there, I think one on 10th and chestnut, and can feel similar to living directly downtown, but I lived on 13th and Broadway and I loved it. Overall the barber neighborhood is a great area. It\u2019s much safer than living directly in downtown, but it is still on the outskirts of it so there can be some riff raff.",

I bike and walk to campus everyday and never have a run in with anyone scary or anything. People saying Chico is scary or unsafe haven\u2019t lived in a city that is actually unsafe. Barber is pretty dark with no streetlights but whatever it\u2019s nice.",

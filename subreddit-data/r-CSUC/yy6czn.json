I took all the fun classes like \u201ctruth, beauty, virtue, etc.\u201d they satisfied a lot of A-G requirements.\n\nHowever, the biggest plus side was living in Konkow. I met some of my best friends there and I would 100% do it again if I had the chance. \n\nNot to mention the professors are for the most part pretty chill and extremely smart in their respective fields. \n\nBut yea the accolade is mostly useless. The perks of early sign ups are VERY nice, though. \n\nAnyway, still went on to become a registered nurse, never really needed the honors curriculum to do so, but it didn\u2019t hurt.",

You\u2019re technically not required to take any honors courses- they\u2019ll drop you from the program in that scenario without any issues.

You all work together to keep the place clean bc nobody else will do it for you. I met my best friends there.

The honors staff can help you achieve a lot of things that most students can't, but you need to have a lot of personal motivation to actually accomplish things. The scholarships and honors dorm are also really nice (at my school anyway).\n\nYou may be required to take honors level classes, maintain a certain gpa, and/or work on honors projects. \n\nI think you should accept it.

I did it to cover some lower division courses, since honors courses count there. They were probably a bit more challenging in some sense, but doable. Do it for the first two years (or until you have no more lower division GEs left) and drop the program. I did it so I would have higher priority in class enrollment when I was a freshman or sophomore. By the time you are a junior, your priority will be higher and taking honors classes are no longer worth it. Plus, some the upper division honors courses are not worth it when you can take a much easier normal upper division GE",

    "postText": "Hey guys! Just got my acceptance letter this morning and I\u2019m super stoked to be a Wildcat starting in January. I\u2019m just wondering if I should file the application for on-campus housing or try and scrounge and find a place off-campus. I\u2019m taking out some loans either way, so cost isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nThanks!",

You could say you\u2019ll be meeting people in class, but nothing like hanging out late at night with your friends without worrying about when you or they have to \u201cgo home.\u201d Also, gives you and easier opportunity to network",

The dorms are just going to be a bunch of 18 year old kids and if you\u2019re a 21-22 year old transfer that doesn\u2019t sound too fun",

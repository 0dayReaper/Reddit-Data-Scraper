    "postText": "I'm a prospective student interested in creative writing, especially in graphic novels, film, or video games, and it'd be great to get some insight from anyone who has been in any related programs.\n\nIs there a decent film production/ screenwriting course or program? I saw the cinema studies minor and media arts program, but are those actually beneficial for going into a movie/television field? \n\nAdditionally, I saw a graphic novels course offered in the English program, has anyone taken it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, how's the outdoorsy life? The town looks beautiful, is it pretty common for students to go hiking, biking, swimming, et cetera?\n\nAnd of course, how is the party life \\*really\\*. The general consensus I've found from doing a lot of reading is that it's definitely there, but doesn't completely dominate the school. I'm pretty introverted and really don't like party/Greek Life scenes, so I'm definitely worried the atmosphere of the school won't be a good fit. \n\nThanks!",

Shasta, the Sutter Buttes, Lake Oroville, and even Lake Tahoe isn\u2019t too far away. Look up Adventure Outings. They do all of this. As for partying you don\u2019t have to party to fit in. Plenty of people don\u2019t.",

I think Chico locals dislike it more than most students because of the collateral damage that comes from it. I think some students don't think about that because they're here for 4-5 years and then leave, while the town's left holding the bag. They don't see the longterm effects that all these parties have on the community year over year.",

I\u2019ve taken a lot of the courses you\u2019d be taking in that major. \n\nI can tell you that the department hired a new screenwriting/media theory professor about 1-2 years ago, Josh Moss. He\u2019s fantastic, has a long history working in the industry. He\u2019s been a screenwriter, worked for ad agencies, etc. He knows his shit and if you\u2019re passionate and hard-working, he\u2019ll work with you and give you a lot of great advice. Expect criticism from him and use it well. \n\nI didn\u2019t take any of the dedicated video production classes but from what I\u2019ve heard from friends they\u2019re pretty demanding. Jen Meadows, who teaches some of those courses, is also a pretty harsh critic - but that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nA handful of other requisite classes will also include video production projects, especially Chiara Ferrari, Quinn Winchell, and John Rousseau\u2019s. As I was graduating there seemed to be a general shift in the department\u2019s attitude towards focusing more heavily on media production for midterm/final projects, which should also be good for you. \n\nIn the end though, I\u2019d say the major is what you make of it. You have to be driven, willing to be independent, and creative, but collectively they\u2019ll give you a lot of the tools you need to be successful. \n\nOh also, it\u2019s fairly easy to catch the professors\u2019 attentions and become a standout student to them if you\u2019re paying attention, engaging with them and the material, and doing honest work. If you can get close to them, by the time you\u2019re a junior/senior it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll recommend you for special topics classes and extracurricular projects that look great in a portfolio. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

            "comment": "Hi there, I graduated from Media Arts a couple years ago and it has some good writing classes. I took two: Writing for Electronic Media (I think it's called \"Writing for Screen Media\" now) which is an intro level course, and Basics of Advertising Copywriting. I chose the latter because I thought it would be more helpful for my career goals, but one of the other choices in the writing category is simply \"Scriptwriting\", several of my friends took it and enjoyed it.\n\nMedia Arts as a major is pretty broad, because there are so many ways a person can apply that skillset nowadays, companies in all kinds of industries are incorporating people with media backgrounds to produce content for their brand. So it really is what you make of it. Right now I'm working for a local news station. When I first graduated about 3-4 of my classmates were also working there, but they've all since moved on to other jobs (either larger TV markets or productions outside of TV). One of my good friends just finished the program last semester and she has a specific goal of screenwriting, so she's working on finding a way to launch her career down in LA right now. I think to augment her writing she minored in Creative Writing or something like that. It can be tough to break into film/TV industry regardless of what kind of job you want, but there are steps you can take to get you from A to B.\n\nThe outdoor life is great IMO. I'm not only a Chico alumnus, but I grew up here in Chico so I've spent a lot of my life outside in and around Chico. The park is the main focus, but there are a lot of excellent places to hike, bike, camp, fish, and explore all over. There's a national park just an hour and a half up into the Cascades, there are some great creeks and rivers for tubing; great city and municipal parks for walking, relaxing, or maybe having a picnic.\n\nI'm an introvert too so I had no interest in the party scene, and it's perfectly possible to get through your time at Chico State without having any direct encounters with it.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

    "postText": "If I link my bank account to direct deposit will the school be able to withdraw money from my account without my permission? Also on my portal in the hold section, it says, \"Ready with Support.  Enroll in a designated GE Math/Quantitative Reasoning (A4) course paired with a support course, MATH 051, in your first semester.\" What class would I have to take in order to complete this?",

            "comment": "As for the math portion of the question, you will have to take basic math 101 along side an online course called Aleks (math 51). It\u2019s like any basic online math learner such as khan academy etc.. email/call your counselor if you\u2019re not already enrolled in those two math classes. I had to take it, it sucked, but oh well. Try to get Sophie Huck as you\u2019re prof she\u2019s great.",

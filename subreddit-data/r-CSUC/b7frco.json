The only exception might be the part time faculty who get kinda boned by the whole situation. But you can go [here](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/california-state-university/) and look up any faculty member or administrator and find out what they make annually. In most cases it's above $70K/year, in the case of a lot of tenured professors, they made over $100K last year. President Hutchinson made almost $370K in 2018.\n\nThose are 2018 numbers, and they just got a 3.5% raise in October, so they're probably higher now.\n\nMy first semester at Chico State the faculty almost went on strike because they were fighting for a raise, which they got, and shortly thereafter there was a corresponding hike in tuition.\n\nMaybe at other CSU's in cities where the cost of living is significantly higher than Chico, but here I don't see the necessity. But they still get it, and the students end up feeling it the most.",

Unfortunately, I\u2019m having a rough time with one of the last classes I need to graduate from my junior college, and there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t pass it. If I had to retake it, would it throw off my acceptance to CSUC? Or could I stay enrolled and retake it simultaneously?",

Many programs afford a semester's worth of leeway to clear up any outstanding pre-reqs\n\nI was also able to reverse-articulate a course from Chico back down to my JC to complete an associate's, if that's something you're worried about",

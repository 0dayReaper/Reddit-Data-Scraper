Everyone goes to class and then  drives home. It will be very different making friends. Chico is a college town. Everyone lives within a few blocks/miles of campus where they walk or ride their bikes to class. There's lot of people hanging out on campus or around the town. It has a small town vibe. I would say that is your biggest difference. You need to prioritize what is important to you to make that decision.",

            "comment": "One thing to note is that Pomona uses the quarter system while Chico uses the semester system. 10-weeks vs 14-16-weeks. \n\nI've noticed that Chico has shorter classes. They meet 3-days a week but are only an hour or so long. Other schools meet twice a week with classes that last 1.5-2 hours. \n\nWhich is your study style best suited for?\n\nAll I know about cal polys is that they offer a \"hands-on\" approach. \n\nI really never considered Pomona as an option even though they offer more courses that I'm interested in because of the quarter system and its location.",

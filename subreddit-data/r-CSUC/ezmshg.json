    "postText": "When you leave UV through the gate, you have to either slide your ID card or enter a code to get back in, but beginning last week, the code I got when I moved in, which was this semester, stopped working and my ID card doesn't work either. I've heard you have to submit a service request to make your ID card work. How do you go about doing that?",

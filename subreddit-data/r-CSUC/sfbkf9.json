    "postText": "hey all, this is my first year on campus, due to being a transfer student, and so far I haven\u2019t made any close friends, and haven\u2019t been going out too much. I\u2019m pretty social, but I just haven\u2019t found a tight-knit group of people to hangout with. How do I go about this? \nI\u2019d love to meet new people relatively soon so I can have a memorable last semester of college- whether that\u2019s by joining clubs or however. So, What are some active clubs at Chico state, where it will be easy to meet others or other places to meet students? Thanks!",

    "postText": "Just want to put it out there if anyone is still looking for housing, avoid hill properties at all costs. They\u2019re a terrible property management company. They won\u2019t fix anything that needs to be fixed and then when you move out they charge you to fix that item. We only got 30% of our deposit back and we left our apartment in incredibly clean condition. There were little to no damages in the apartment. They charged us the full cost to replace items that were normal wear and tear for an apartment that had been rented for 5 years. They will use your deposit to perform maintenance and upgrades that they should be paying for. They scam students out of their money and there\u2019s nothing you can do to argue against it. Just avoid them if you can.",

Blamed me for a shit ton of damage that I never did and tried to charge me for wear and tear, then withheld my security deposit and tried to charge me even more on top of that. I had to take these crooks to court to get it back.\n\nIt's par for the course with this companies - always trying to rip students off and thinking we wont fight back. Take lots of pics and be ready to sue every time you move out.",

Both will try to take all your money while neglecting the house, and NVPM is just incompetent to boot. They literally have misspellings, typos, incomplete sentences, etc in their leases. And non-matching, random ass Web 1.0 fonts and formatting in their emails. And don't return phone calls or emails.",

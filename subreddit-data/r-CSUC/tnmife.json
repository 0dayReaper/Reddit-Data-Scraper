    "postText": "I'm a Junior in high school and trying to get in a bunch of research before things get stressful and I actually have to make decisions. I have a friend of mine who graduated from the game dev/animation program 2 years ago and he said it was generally good, and the curriculum from a glance looks great. But I looked at Rate My Professors and some of them don't have great scores. Just want to know if theres anything I could/should know. I plan to go down more the 3d art/animation route more specifically. THANKS! :)",

Also most colleges I've looked into have their students go into either a Game Art or Game Design focus for their degree, while teaching how their focus plays into the general pipeline of game development. So do you mean they cater to game design, or does Chico just have an overall \"game development\" curriculum?",

They are tough, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nJohn and Mark were my animation instructors, very chill, and they definitely show their passion in the craft. \n\nGraduated during 2018 in Animation, electives in 3D modeling and Rigging. \n\nI do realize things can change over 4 years.",

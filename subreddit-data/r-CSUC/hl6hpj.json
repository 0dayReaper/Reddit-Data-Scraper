    "postText": "Hi everyone! My friend and I are about to apply to transfer this upcoming Fall 2020 and Chico is one of our priorities. We heard a lot of good things about the school. However, we still have a few more questions to ask and we think it is best if you can help us answers.\n\n1. Major: Our majors are Electrical Engineering and Edu Math. If you are majoring in these majors, can you tell us more about the programs? Internships/job opportunities? How hard to get classes? How are the professors? What is the minimum gpa for each major to get accepted? When applying, does the school consider volunteering experiences or honor titles?\n2. Life: What is it like to live and study at the school? We are both from Silicon Valley. I bet the environment is different there. What kinds of available resources for students on campus? What do you like to do at school and after school? Clubs? Communities? Parking? Do people just come to class and then get off right away? :) That's my experience here is Bay Area; I'm looking for somewhere people are more bonded &lt;3.\n3. Housing/Transportation: How much does off-housing cost? Is it easier to get a studio closed to campus? What kind of transportation do you use the most to commute?\n4. Jobs: What kinds of jobs are available for students at school? Is it easy to apply? I'm thinking of tutoring since that's what I have been doing. However, I'd love to know more than that.\n5. Tuition fees: What are your thoughts of tuition fees here? Are there scholarships to apply? Are there any for international students?\n6. International students (for me only): what is your experience there? Is the international office helpful? Is it easy to have access to counselors, advisors, etc. How much do you pay each semester?\n7. Activities: What's fun at Chico? We haven't been there yet but loved to know more about the area.\n\nThe post is pretty long since we have so many questions. We attended Chico Open House last year and we are still impressed by experience. Thank you so much for your time reading it. Stay safe!",

I was the coordinator of the Tutorial Coordinator my last year at CSU Chico. I always struggled to find volunteer tutors to support high school math students. My time as a volunteer and staff member for CAVE helped me get into two different credential programs and ultimately land a teaching career.",

                            "comment": "For sure! Let me answer some of your questions. \n\n2. Chico is definitely very different from the bay area. Being from the Bay myself, I have found the pace of life is much slower up in Chico. This is not only do to the small size of the town but also the fact that a good portion of business in the area caters to the lifestyles of the students. People here are super friendly and there\u2019s definitely a spirit of community both on and off campus. School has over 250 clubs in pretty much any interest, 13 NCAA sports teams, over 25 club sports, and intramural sports.\n\n3. 90% of students live within two miles of campus, making Chico State one of only two CSU\u2019s to be considered a community campus. Most students walk or bike to school and the majority of them live in off-campus housing. The average coat of rent per person in Chico is just around $300 a month, making it much more affordable than the Bay Area. \n\n4. Chico State has a program called Handshake. Handshake is a job searching site designed for Chico State students and alumni to find jobs while in school and after graduation. There are many job opportunities available on campus, and they are very easy to apply for. However those who apply sooner or more likely to get the jobs as those on campus fill up pretty quickly. Lots of other students work in establishments surrounding the college, which borders downtown Chico. \n\n5. Tuition and fees are decided by the entire CSU system. CSU Chico is amongst one of the most affordable CSU\u2019s because of its low tuition rates and affordable housing. There are a bunch of scholarships to apply for, including the Wildcat Scholarship which opens up at the start of every calendar year. It\u2019s one application with five short essay responses that filters you through over 750 scholarships\u2014 the average award is just about $2500 which would cover about 1/3 of one year\u2019s tuition. \n\n7. Chico is seated in the middle of nowhere in Butte County, meaning we are surrounded by vast wilderness and farming communities. This allows for plenty of time to be spent outdoors hiking, biking, running, and swimming. Bidwell Park is a 13 mile long park that has a pool, swimming holes, trails, and rock climbing\u2014 it\u2019s entrance is exactly one mile from campus. The Sacramento River is only 15 minutes outside of town and a lot of students float down it at various times throughout the year. There is also an active nightlife scene with students frequenting bars and restaurants quite often. Getting involved in clubs, sports, Greek life, or other organizations will open up a plethora of social opportunities for anybody looking to get out. \n\nSource: Former Chico State tour guide and current masters student.",

This office sits right on the edge of campus and generally has alot of police meandering about the place. Outside of that there are a few spots on campus that can be unsafe at night. Under the bridges of the river and behind the old physical science building are both places homeless and vagrants have been found, it's not common and they are super easy spots to avoid. Other than that the campus is really quite nice.",

Chico has a large homeless problem. as long as your not walking to their camps, which are easily spotted or smelled, you're good.   \n\n\nThere has been criticism of chico state for allowing a trans activist speak, to which many stated chico wasn't a safe campus for those feeling offended by the speakers message.   \n\n\nEither way Chico is safe.",

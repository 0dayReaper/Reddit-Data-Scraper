Since we no longer have access to these things I can see an argument for getting the fees refunded, but as long as they are still giving us the chance to finish and get credit for our classes I do not see any reason for them to refund tuition.",

Because a lot of students need that money to survive, let alone keep attending classes. If we were refunded that money, we would see those most vulnerable students who work their asses off at the WREC, BMU, Library, etc, lose their money, for sure. I'm a lab assistant and a grader on campus, and they are working with me to continue to get paid. As far as I know the people who were working in the WREC are still getting paid and that is important.\n\nI'd rather lose a couple hundred bucks this semester, then my greediness be the reason someone else is unable to attend college.",

In a career you're paid by the year, and you have vacation time. With hourly jobs like at the WREC, you don't have vacation time. If you're not working that you're not getting paid. I feel bad for these people, dont get me wrong, but you dont think theres other people out there who cant pay bills because the McDonalds they work at is closed? Why would I keep paying McDonalds employees if I cant eat there anymore. Its exactly the same as why would I pay WREC employees if I cant go there anymore",

The fact is that this isn't a normal situation. You aren't spending money you don't have, you are talking about money you've already spent and you're all pissy because they're not going to pay you back money that you already signed away.\n\nIn fact, if you are taking out loans you're literally spending money you don't have to be here... Which is a hilarious double standard. \n\nHow much of that borrowed money would you get back? Let's see. Based on this : https://www.csuchico.edu/bud/_assets/documents/student-tuitions-spring-2019-20.pdf\n\nFor undergrad, which I'm guessing you are. 2871 for Tuition.\n\n415 Student Union Fee. (Which goes towards the BMU and the WREC, as well as construction or operation of student body centers.)\n69 for AS Activity (Student government and what not)\nConsolidated Course fee no, Student learning fee no, IRA's no, Health Services fee and Facilities fee, that's 250 about. But, there are still people currently working there providing services and organizing students going to doctors that aren't the health center.\n\nOkay, so 415 + 69 = 484. \n\nOkay, it's halfway through the semester. So 242.\n\nOkay, now, let's say that they were to refund you 242 dollars. It would probably be a huge loss for the to cut checks right now, which they aren't required to at all. You should read the contracts you signed to join up, you aren't owed ANYTHING.\n\nBut, chances are they'll reduce next semesters fees... Or not.",

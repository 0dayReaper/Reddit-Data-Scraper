    "postText": "Hey everyone! New transfer student that\u2019s been looking for a place in Chico for awhile now. I live 5 hours south and am not familiar with the area so hoping to get some insight. Got approved for a 1 bedroom at Wildcat Crossing today, so they\u2019ll be generating my lease takeover forms tomorrow. Is anyone familiar with this complex? I liked that it had a simple pet policy, no pet rent, as well as the unit being recently renovated. However, don\u2019t know anything about the area aside from that it\u2019s close to campus, so although not relevant right now because classes will be virtual again next semester but I\u2019m sure will be convenient when campus opens back up.  Any response would be appreciated, thanks!",

Honestly I don\u2019t know that I see myself staying in that complex, I just want to get settled up there before the next semester starts and I had a lease takeover situation fall through already. Hoping to eventually find a friend to go in on a house after I get up there unless this complex ends up working out for me.",

The disadvantages will be that you're directly next to Nord Avenue which is a pretty constantly busy road, and quite close to the railroad tracks too, so if you're sensitive to noise it might not be the best choice. Otherwise I can't see any reason not to recommend it.",

Now downsizing to an apartment with a small patio so it\u2019s crucial I can take him out on walks.",

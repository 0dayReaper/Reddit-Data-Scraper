I geuss it's pretty much just dorms but not on campus and for cheaper. Wondering if anyone has any experience/advice to which one may be better.",

The rooms and closets are nice sized at the social and you can even have your own private suite. You are required to have a meal plan set up. Private bathrooms are a plus. Not sure it\u2019s a cheaper route, my monthly rent is $1,035 for a single suite (shared unit but private room.) ($735 rent, $300 for meal plan)",

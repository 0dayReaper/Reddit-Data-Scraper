    "postText": "Hi, everyone! I received an email indicated that I was admitted by CSU Chico, I was very happy and excited. I also logged on the student portal, and I saw the study plan said nursing(undergraduate). Does this mean I am admitted by the nursing department as well? I know some CSUs they separate the school admission from the nursing admission. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Personally I would call admissions to make sure Prior to accepting anything. Since Chico state has one of the hardest Nursing Programs to get in to because they are impacted. When I transferred in last semester, when I got my acceptance letter and looked at my portal all it said was what I specifically applied to and got accepted for. So its very likely! just call admissions to double check on that",

    "postText": "A friend and I are planning on dorming together in Chico in the fall. We are both coming out of high school.l, so I have some questions for students and alumni of Chico:\n\nHow likely is it that we will be able to form together if we both request each other?\n\nWhat dorms would you suggest if we specifically want 2 people only?\n\nAre there any bigger dorms with a kitchen or extra rooms of any kind?\n\nWhat are your personal experiences in a dorm?\n\nWhat dorm would you recommend?\n\nWhere could we meet the most people?\n\nWhat is the nicest dorm?\n\nThank you for any help you are able to provide and I look forward to reading, learning, and taking advise from your own experiences.\n\nAdditionally I have some questions about frats. I will go into more detail in a future post, but how would I go about joining a frat, is it a good idea, have you heard any initiation stories (besides the one that resulted in death), what experiences have you had in frats/sororities and how do you feel about the people inside of frats from an outside perspective?",

Sutter is basically just new Whitney, nicer but still doesn't have the legacy Whitney has. Because of Whitney's reputation people put in their requests super early to live there. Those are the two marquee dorms but any other are fine, just whatever you do, don't live at UV.",

            "comment": "**How likely is it that we will be able to form together if we both request each other?** 99.9% assuming you are both the same sex. Chico doesn't have co-ed roommates, but does have co-ed floors. But you need to make sure you do it right. People try and request each other and misspell names or do other dumb stuff that you think \"there's no way I would do that!\" and boom, there you are, paired with a stranger.\n\n**What dorms would you suggest if we specifically want 2 people only?** Shasta and Lassen definitely have doubles only. No other choice there except for doubles. You definitely will not get paired with a 3rd or 4th roommate there. There are triples and quads in Whitney. UV has 6 person \"clusters\" where you share a kitchen. There's also Konkow with a house style so you'll share with a ton of people. I think Mechoopda and Esken have doubles too, but I don't know if they have triples or quads.\n\n**Are there any bigger dorms with a kitchen or extra rooms of any kind?** UV is an apartment style. So it has a kitchen that's shared by 6 people. (2 double rooms and 2 single rooms makes a total of 6). Also Shasta and Lassen have tiny kitchenettes that are shared by the whole building. They are ok, but not great. Everyone has access to the cafeteria in Sutter and the \"Wildcat Den\" which is like a cafe kind of place.\n\n**What are your personal experiences in a dorm?** I've lived in all of them at one point or another. Whitney is loud but you'll meet 400 people on the first day. It's great for being social and terrible for studying. Sutter is quieter, newer, and feels spacier. It doesn't have as many people, but it's got nice lounges. Shasta and Lassen are both the same. They can be noisy, but it depends on your floor. Not as many people as Whitney, but if you just happen to get a floor with a bunch of party dudes, then you're going to feel just like Whitney. UV is apartments. It's very individualistic. You'll be out there, your friends will be the people you live with or people you meet in class. You'll want to have a car, but you'll feel more like an adult than a college student. Konkow is entirely dependent on who you live with. It's smaller, but the group you live with will become very close.\n\n**What dorm would you recommend?** I liked Sutter the best. But it depends on your style. I'm **very** nerdy and already have a group of friends. I didn't care about meeting people and I didn't care about going to parties.\n\n**Where could we meet the most people?** Whitney.\n\n**What is the nicest dorm?** Sutter.",

During this time it would be a good idea to meet with as many fraternities as possible to get a feel for the members of the various houses.  \n\nI graduated 2001 and was a member of Theta Chi (OX).  Hazing for all fraternities really stopped shortly after this.  Especially, with the death of Matthew Carrington in 2005.  All of the national chapters have educated the houses and the last thing someone wants is to be criminally charged for hazing.",

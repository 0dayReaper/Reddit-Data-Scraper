Never have I seen my race or skin tone as being an issue nor do I dress as a suspicious person nor act like one. Personally I don't victimize myself nor race bait thinking that every cop out there is tryna do me dirty. I don't watch the news cause its all negative news and there's obviously an agenda behind it. Now there's obviously cops who are assholes but who cares. Not every person you meet will like you, the same way not every person you meet you'll like. The way I see it, these dudes are doing their job, they see someone who is acting sus or looking sus then you're guna get pulled over. Simple.",

Furthermore, cops who are assholes, should be worth a concern because they\u2019re cops. They\u2019re supposed to protect us, and make us feel safe. The police called back up, simply for looking suspicious with his bike. Should be worth a concern..",

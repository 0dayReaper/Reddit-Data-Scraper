    "postText": "I\u2019m making a tough decision deciding which to attend first or if I should attend Chico for 2 full years. Is Chico worth attending for 2 years? I want to earn my bachelors degree from Chico however I feel that doing my first year online at ASU will be less stressful (that way I don\u2019t have to deal with the housing situation). I\u2019d like to attend a Chico the first year but I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t like it, I will want to attend ASU Online. The problem is, I want to earn my BS from Chico because I hear a lot of employers hire from there. On the other hand, I want to attend ASU Online first so I can attend Chico State my second year where I can earn my BS there, but I\u2019m afraid I might enjoy Chico and regret ever taking ASU Online in the first place. I\u2019m really conflicted here and I wondering if anyone can give me a better perspective since my mind is foggy.",

I'd say it depends on what experience you want to have. Do you want to go to a physical campus or continue online? You could always do a semester at Chico and see how it goes and if you decide it isn't for you finish up at ASU.",

Do you think the experience is really worth it? I just visited Chico and after hearing that it is a party school it seemed pretty dark at night and mainly active Downtown. The people are definitely chill there but I\u2019m having a hard time finding a nice place to live by the school, so I\u2019m planning on attending ASU online to buy me some time. If the experience is really worth it can you describe what it is really like or might be like ?",

It\u2019s also because I\u2019m trying to get the best deal since I\u2019m already getting ripped off paying thousands of dollars in the first place haha, so I figure saving time is the best way I can make up for it. I also want to start working but employers want to see a fancy paper, and I get it. It\u2019s ridiculous but I get it. The main thing that\u2019s holding me back is this college experience that everyone talks about. I visited Chico and I liked it. I genuinely enjoyed the atmosphere there because it was a very laid back vibe, I felt feel like I was surrounded by people I was on par with or vice versa. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it but I just don\u2019t like knowing I\u2019m wasting time especially when there are opportunities to work around the clock. I\u2019m just unsure if I\u2019ll regret not going there for two years, but I\u2019d much rather earn my degree there than at ASU and that\u2019s why I\u2019m deciding if I should attend ASU Online first before attending Chico state. I also heard online and in person from someone I met at orientation that employers hire people from there which is another main reason why I don\u2019t want to give it up.",

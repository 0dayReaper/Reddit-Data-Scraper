    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to transfer to Chico from SF State to major in computer animation and game development (currently undeclared). I\u2019m looking all over the website section but I can\u2019t tell if there are any pre-requirements for the major. (Example: you have to take 2 years algebra/1 sem stats to major in comp sci at sf state.) Also, does it tend to be more math or art heavy if I intend to go with game developing? (I guess this depends). Any advice is appreciated.",

I\u2019ve always been rly sucky at drawing and painting, but I haven\u2019t found that to be an issue at all in this major (focusing on game development). What it rly comes down to is creativity, your ability to learn multiple softwares, and ability to work in a team (not be an asshole). A counselor would be able to answer your questions about prerequisites better than me. Good luck! :D",

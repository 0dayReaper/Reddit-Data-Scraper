I never doubted that, but realize that even during the summer when there was no school many of the frar houses still had reports of parties and suchlike the entire time. \n\nIts frustrating but I don't see any moral high ground for anyone in this situation. Well except for people who live in town all the time and have been staying home as much as possible to avoid potential disease spread.",

Both have been seen congregating in groups larger than 5 persons and well within 6 ft of each other. One resident here went to a frat house on move in week and reportedly saw people bunched like sardines inside, as if it were a regular day for a large social gathering. My RA thinks Wittney should have never been opened and my suitemates and I think the frat houses should have been closed.",

            "comment": "Former RA here, it depends on the kind of experience that you are looking for. Whitney is definitely a more social dorm so if you are looking for partying and stuff thats what you want. Shasta is also very social and tends to be louder as a result. Lassen is the quietest of the three but its still a dorm so its still going to be noisy on the weekends.\n\nEdit: Also Whitney tends to have a LOT more fire alarms so keep that in mind too. I was an RA in the 9th floor and it was a bitch going down those stairs for fire alarms.",

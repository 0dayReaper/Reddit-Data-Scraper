    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m looking for insight on Chico\u2019s business program, primarily Management Information Systems. Any information from current or former students is greatly appreciated. \n\nSome background:\nCurrently a Non-Traditional student at a  CC majoring in Business Administration for transfer. I have a family and am debating on whether to pursue UC Davis\u2019s Managerial Economics major or Chico\u2019s MIS major. \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward MIS as the cost of living is more affordable at Chico than Davis and as much as I like economics I\u2019m not entirely sure of the pathway with Managerial Economics.",

Full time credits (12 units or more) is only 4k a semester. Cost of living is good too but wages are $15 an hour min wage. So you will either need to live in the off campus dorms or live with roommates. \n\nAs far as the business program goes the professors are great and a lot of them will go out of their way to help you in any way they can! Def recommend",

The upper level classes I took were incredibly relevant to the real world experience that I had in my job, which I would say is a good sign that they are preparing students well.\n\nThe program/teachers also brought in a number of high level companies (Chevron, Deloitte to name a few) to talk to us and I know many get jobs through those connections",

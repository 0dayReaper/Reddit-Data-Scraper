    "postText": "Hey everybody, incoming transfer student for fall 2023. I won't dwell on it, but I was homeschooled in high school and I never had a chance to try any dating/romance as a younger teenager. A big reason I'm coming to college is to make up for that lost time. After trying to make it work at a very un-social community college, I'm worried that Chico State might be similar.\n\nSo what I'm asking is... is Chico State a good place for an inexperienced guy like me to meet girls/get into relationships? I'm really hoping that this school will help me experience the puppy love I've been looking for, but please don't hesitate to crush my hopes and dreams if not haha.\n\n All comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Well this is definitely a first of this kind of post for me. I grew up homeschooled too but in a co-op so lots of socializing and such (graduating class of 74 peers) but as for the dating and social scene in general it's fine. I can't be specific as I was in a relationship before I got here and I'm an engineering major so not much free time but if you have a more chill major you will be fine. Just try to make friends, go to events, maybe hit up some concerts at Naked Lounge. The girls here are pretty chill and depending on the type you want just try to go to some party's and talk to em. Most college gals are interested in casual relationships. \n\nBtw what major are you transferring in for?",

I don't know what the Naked Lounge is or where to find parties (I'd like to avoid frat houses if possible) but I'll definitely try out both.\n\nMy major is anthropology! I'm gonna be Indiana Jones :)",

First of all, Chico is a super social school, so you\u2019ll have no trouble meeting people if you put yourself out there. And second, chicks love archaeologists. I did it for 8 years after college and it was very easy to get dates with that. It\u2019s once they start to see the kind of lifestyle that archaeologists live that it gets trickier lol. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions about anthro/arch by the way! Chico has a great anthro program but the reality of archaeology was waaay different from what I expected when I graduated.",

I'm not really looking for a person to spend the rest of my life with either haha - I'm just starting out, after all! I try to be friends with the person for at least a couple of weeks before \"making a move\" too. I don't know if that's too soon or waiting too long, but I definitely try to take it slow. \n\nMaybe I am putting too much pressure on myself. I haven't thought of that before.

You can still apply for housing! https://csuchico.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortalX/8CD7E1A6/6/7/Home-Resident_Center_Home. However, I would wait until they announce weather dorms will be open or not and save $300",

Since we're going predominantly online, we will probably see a significant drop in students looking for places in town.\n\nThe town is already anticipating a [hit to the local economy due to going online](https://krcrtv.com/news/local/chico-council-says-local-economy-will-be-devastated-without-chico-state-students)",

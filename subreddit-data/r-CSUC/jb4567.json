AFAIK there's no official internship partnering program but there are plenty of resources to get one.\nIf you care, the good teachers there will help you learn. Work on side projects, and apply to companies. Students have interned at (and gone to) most of the FAANG companies.",

            "comment": "Chico State is in the midst of redesigning all the websites and the CS department redesigned the Masters program relatively recently so that the curriculum fits what our students have been looking for: more applied skills that can prepare them to work in industry (and less emphasis on research).\n\nThe current curriculum can be found in the [catalog](http://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/20/CSCI/CSCINONEMS.html). Some of the info on the department website still needs to be updated, but the catalog reflects the **official** requirements.\n\nI'm a professor in the department so I'm biased and of course say it is a good program. If you want practical skills (with an emphasis on software engineering / algorithms / and AI/ML), it will be a good match. Our graduates have done well finding jobs (mostly SE from what I can tell). Some of them work locally in Chico, but many have moved to bigger cities to work at software companies after graduating.\n\nAnyone looking for a program that is more focused on research, I recommend looking at PhD programs instead. Most CS PhD programs will accept people with just Bachelors... and will offer stipends to accepted students.\n\nYou mentioned analytics. The curriculum does not have a focus on it, but we might (along with the Math department) be offering a Data Science Masters in the future.\n\nIf you have more questions about our program, however, I recommend reaching out to our department Chair, [Tyson Henry](https://www.csuchico.edu/csci/people/faculty/henry-tyson.shtml).",

However, I believe you're right that the MBA program has a pretty good reputation if your goals are really more business administration-oriented.\n\nSecondly, the CS department has made recent updates to classes (and continues to do so). Our Masters students have also done well securing jobs at software companies, which was the reason most students chose our program. Especially when you take into consideration the cost compared to other MS CS programs, I think our program's value is hard to dispute.\n\nThirdly, the MS in CS program is not accredited. The BS in CS and the BS in CINS both are, but we have not sought accreditation for the Masters program. Accreditation is a mixed bag. ABET paperwork and reviews take a lot of work (for faculty and staff) but also help get recognition and external validation. We found that a lot of employers who routinely hire our BS students loved that we were ABET accredited (and some even *required* an accredited degree). For some reason, there is less demand for accrediting the MS program, perhaps because our undergraduate program already has a good reputation and the same faculty teach the graduate classes. Come to think of it, [ABET's website doesn't even list *any* MS in CS programs](https://amspub.abet.org/aps/category-search?disciplines=19&amp;degreeLevels=M) so maybe it isn't even an option.\n\nFinally, the BS in CS has been accredited since 1987. I'll be honest though, I have no idea what the program's reputation was 30+ years ago compared to today.",

During that time, the accreditation forced allowing people to work from home and upload code and other changes that were unusual.  \n\nComputer Science at Chico had a simple mantra of turning out graduates in four years that looked, on the surface, as graduates with five years of experience.  This lead to choices where large programs were required, e.g., input validation and output formatting needed to be written.  Also, the schedule was rigged such that no two classes would use the same hardware, operating system, language, or editor.   Clear communication was emphasized, and deadlines were strict.  Chico graduates were known to proactively figure out how to work in whatever environment they were dropped.\n\nIt had been one of the best, and was the best in the CSU system.",

It shouldn't be *necessary* (and is far from the norm) to have previous publications to get into our MS program, but doing so demonstrates some strengths that could help make up for any weaknesses in the application.\n\nThat goes for both research and professional experience. Either looks good. Remember that most people going into the MS program have either (A) just finished their BS (and most undergrads don't have publications and maybe just an internship of previous experience) or (2) had their degree and worked for a bit and wants to go for a MS to open up new career options.\n\n&gt; Also, can he submit his graduate application as early as October thus receiving his admit earlier than others?

Either kind of internship will look good and open doors. They just express (somewhat) different trajectories for your career. Many CS students go into Software Engineering jobs. Some of them are interested in more management-oriented positions, while others maintain a more technical-oriented career.",

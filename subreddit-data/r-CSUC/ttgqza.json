    "postText": "Hey all! I was due to transfer to Chico this fall, but I went to visit the campus and town and I'm left feeling very hesitant.\n\nI was pretty surprised by just how tiny and isolated Chico felt. How do you feel about just how distant it is from an actual city and how small Chico is? \n\nI love the school and student culture, but my fear of ending up feeling trapped in an isolated small town is really holding me back here. Any thoughts?",

            "comment": "It depends what's important to you.\n\nI grew up and spent my entire life in a large city. So, I wanted a small college town. If you stay in the downtown area, pretty much every person you meet is going to be pretty young and somehow affiliated with the university. If you go to a school in a large city, it's mixed. Is there more to do in a large city? Sure, but that doesn't mean Chico doesn't have much to offer. If you're really going to take advantage of what a large city has over Chico (sports teams, amusement parks, specialty stores/entertainment), and it's important to you, then you'll find more enjoyment at a large city. However, you will not have *nearly* as immersive of a student life experience as you will at Chico.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the small town of Chico, you have a greater sense of community, it was nice having a common connection with my neighbors and pretty much every person I met, and while there were things I missed about the big city (largely the food) it really didn't affect my enjoyment of Chico at all.",

The nice thing about Chico is that it's in close proximity to tons of stuff. San Francisco, Tahoe, etc. Also if you're an outdoorsy person, there's soooo many places to swim, hike, camp. Again, all of this comes down to having a car. So I would weigh this into your consideration.",

You will get your driver's license suspended and can only drive to school and home. Butte County is one of the few counties with this law. \n\nIt is illegal to drink alcohol where it can be seen from the street. This is a Chico ordinance to prevent people from drinking on their front porch. Do you think people in nice areas not near the college get tickets for violating that ordinance? \n\nThe campus is liberal, the town the campus is located in is extremely hostile to students.",

Me personally I'm transferring out because that's not the type of environment I thrive in. Chico isn't as small as people make it out to be, there's tons to do, especially on campus, but it gets old fast. Keep in mind that the nearest big city is 2 hours away and the nearest city is 30 minutes away, so if you want a change in scenery, it's not as easily accessible as for example, UC Davis, or UCSC.",

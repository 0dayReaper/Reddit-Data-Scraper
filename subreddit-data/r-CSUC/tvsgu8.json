It's big, and that's enough to create a highly social atmosphere. I had friends (still have most of them, all these years later!) who lived in Lassen and Shasta, and their experience of the dorms was somewhat more intimate (not strictly in terms of sex, although, hey, it was college) because they're smaller.",

I\u2019ve talked to alumni that graduated over 20-30 years ago and more recent ones. People at whitney will pull fire alarms at like 3am and everyone would have to leave the building. Something is always happening there. Personally, I applied to Sutter. From what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s Super active, but not as Loud as whitney. It also has rooms that are like 20% larger. But don\u2019t take any of this as fact. Just what I\u2019ve heard. Hope it helps.",

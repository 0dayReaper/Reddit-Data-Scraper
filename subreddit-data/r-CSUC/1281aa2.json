    "postText": "Hello everybody! I\u2019m currently deciding if I want to attend UCSC or CSUC this upcoming fall, but before I decide, I have a few questions specifically for those in/graduated from the public health major.\n\n-How is the quality of the public health major? Do you think it compares to other schools? How difficult is it? Are the teachers good? \n\n-Is it easy to find undergraduate research at Chico? Semi related, I know an internship class is required to graduate for public health, so if anyone could let me know their experience with internships, that would be nice too",

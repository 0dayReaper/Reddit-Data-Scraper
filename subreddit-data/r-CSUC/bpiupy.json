Am I wrong, can you earn an A+, and what percentage would you need to earn one. Thanks\n\nAlso 93% and above is a solid A while 90-93% is an A- right?",

Most will list their grade ranges on their syllabus so it's best to check there for each of your classes.\n\nGenerally an A is around 92 to 93 and above, but in my previous CHEM class the A began at an 80%.\n\nI don't think A+ are given at Chico, atleast I have never had a class with them here. Ultimately it does not matter as an A is a 4.0 and you cannot get higher than that. \n\nIf you're worried about keeping your A then do the extra cred, otherwise no need. Best of luck.",

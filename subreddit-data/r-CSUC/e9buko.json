But you get to do wine tasting once a week, you get to keep your set of tasting glasses, and you can actually gain a cool skill by knowing and understanding wine.\n\nI took it my last semester to get the last few units I needed and I really enjoyed it. And knowing a few things about wine has come in handy since then.",

The beginning class gives you three pool dives and two dives in the forebay and an option to upgrade to the next level (about $180 more which I just did) and then there is a level 2 via an internship which I will be doing next semester. That one takes you up another level and nets you a specialization such as those awesome underwater propulsion devices, search and rescue, assecability, etc. \n\nYou should bop by the SCUBA hut and talk to them about it! There are two guys, Richard and Erik, and they're great.",

Its easier to meet new people and its more convenient to live on campus in Whitney, Shasta, Lassen, etc. UV is more private and disconnected from campus, and as a result is a little less social.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for one of the on campus dorms your freshman year, then move off campus to a non-university owned apartment/house for your sophomore year onward.",

Whenever anything breaks in the community they take way too long to fix it; the laundry card machine was broken for 6 weeks, the internet was \u201cupgraded\u201d and was extremely slow for an entire week. The lights on a building by mine went out and weren\u2019t fixed for 3 weeks.\n\nIn addition, housing will do things without giving us enough time in advance. For example, the Fire Marshall was checking rooms of all residents with only two days warning.",

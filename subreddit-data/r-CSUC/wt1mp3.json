    "postText": "In highschool I had a very hard time making friends. I was kinda judgy and didn\u2019t really like a lot of people cuz they were too immature for me. So now I come into college and I\u2019m having hard time making friends. I want to but I literally have a reflexing giving a guy a dirty look cuz I think what if he\u2019s hitting on me, or I\u2019ll come up to someone and talk to them and they don\u2019t wanna talk. Im not sure how to make the friends, and it just feels like the people I wanna be friends with are upper class men and I\u2019m 19 and stuck with children. I can really feel the age difference and it\u2019s awkward for me. Give me some tips on how to make friends with upper classmen or how to deal with people more immature than me please.",

Either something you have some experience in or something you\u2019d like to get experienced in. \n\nThere are all sorts of events for new students to learn about the clubs and various activities available to Chico state students. \n\nAlso, just practice. Walk up to the groups tabling on Chico state and listen to what they have to say and just talk to people. People tabling have a motive to be friendly and that is to get you to join their organization. I\u2019m a member of a few organizations on campus and can 100% say that clubs are one of the best ways to make long lasting friends while in college.",

Maybe try maturing and treat others how you would like to be treated. Chico is a social af university, so the issue isn't the university or its culture...",

And from what I\u2019m hearing, you don\u2019t seem to be giving yourself much of a break. You\u2019re in a new place full of new people and responsibilities and pressures. This is a learning and adjustment period. So my advice is to practice some self compassion. If you want friends, they will come. Please try and not be picky. There are people you see around that you may want to engage with I get how attractive popular kids are. But there are also quietly people who need you. And as you become more sensitive to your new environment, you will probably notice these people. If you feel like you were a bitch, then ok, it happened, don\u2019t let it own you. Be patient in this new place and kind to all your new potential friends. You belong here.\n\nEdit: changed second sentence to my perspective.",

There are plenty of different things that happen around campus that let you meet new people, but clubs are more fun than most because its something you (theoretically at least) are learning or doing specifically with other people!\n\nAs for making friends in class, do not worry about it too much. The semester just started and everyone is trying to figure out who is who and what the pecking order is in classes. You dont need to be best friends right out the gate, just start with 1 person you think you would be friends with and get to know them. Then meet thier friends, etc\n\nLastly for the age gap, i was in my late 20s when i went to school here. There was a gap in references and knowledge, but it let me get to know my teachers and other students in similar situations better, odds are there is someone else like you at school you havent met yet.",

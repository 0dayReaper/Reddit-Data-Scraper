            "comment": "This is my last semester as a MIS major. I think the program has its pros and cons. There are some fun and cool classes that you will take, but there are also some dreadful ones, but that is with a lot of majors.\nBusiness that tend to recruit from Chico are I know Chevron and some others I cant think of right now. I have friends thag majored in MIS and are working in San Jose and the Bay Area making nice money. \nThe staff are pretty good, I think out of all the Business majors, MIS and SupplyChain have the highest job placement after graduating. There are some of the best professors on campus in the program, and some of the worst lol. Good luck doing SAP in Tom Wilders class if he still teaches it. Everyone hates that class. \n\nWhether the program prepares you for the work force all depends on what you do with your time. If you hang out with clubs and do extracurriculars and go to office hours, you will learn a lot compared to just doing your homework and going to class. Personally, you have to do a lot of self learning and teach yourself instead of your professors. But if you know what area you want to get into and focus on that and apply yourself with the help of your professors, you will be just fine.\n\nDont forget to have fun while here too, go out with friends when you can because school will burn you out quick if you let it. Any other questions about MIS you can dm me. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Graduated in 2018 with a Degree in BIS and an option in MIS, currently have been in the industry for 4 years working as a senior Data Engineer in the Bay Area. I have worked with startups, Fortune 500 companies, etc. so I have seen a little bit of everything so this reply will come from my experience in the industry and how I think the BIS/SAP Program prepared me for moving into a data role right out of college. If you play your cards right, you will be making more money than 90% of your graduating class within two years. \n\n1. When I was there the program was very SAP-based, which is great but I wish it took into account some more cloud technologies such as AWS, GCP, and Redshift. Personally, I always found SAP boring as all hell and hated going through ECC and moving transactions through the software trying to remember T-Codes. I will say that it has been helpful to have that knowledge especially when I moved into my first job out of college because a huge percentage of companies use SAP as their ERP and will continue to do so but in my opinion, the program was too focused on SAP and not enough on the more advancing cloud technologies or the \"modern data stack\" many orgs are using such as Snowflake, Redshift, AWS, Airflow, DBT, Informatica, Matillion, etc. Looking back it seems like the program is a little stuck in the past teaching aging technologies that are more or less immediately obsolete when you hit the workforce (looking at you on-premise RDMBS). I have found that not many young people (especially coming out of college) have chosen \nto make SAP their profession, it is just too big of a beast that there is no way you can gain the technical experience necessary to pass a job interview right of college most SAP professionals that I have come across in my career has either been 20+ year SAP vets or an offshore team.I will say that the SQL classes were very helpful, SQL is the language that I use every single day paired with Python to move and manipulate data. If you are competent in both SQL and Python coming out of college you will have no issue landing a job, right now we are in an extremely hot hiring market for Technical positions which I don't foresee going anywhere unless we slip into a recession. \n\n2. Not many tech companies in the area, myself like many of my fellow classmates got a job in the Bay Area right after college. Career fairs are a good place to start. I worked on campus IT for 3 years which helped pay rent and bolster my resume.\n\n3. The staff are kind of a little old school, but they knew what they were teaching in and out and were happy to sit down with me during office hours and let me pick their brain when I was going into job interviews right out of school. I just wish the program was a little modernized and utilized more recent technologies that are actually being used for the semantic layer in the industry as opposed to being so SAP heavy. \n\n4. I do think I was prepared for the workforce to an extent, mainly from the SQL and programming classes. However, the best way to really learn the ins and outs and bolster your technical chops is to do personal projects outside of class whether that's making an ETL pipeline moving data with python from s3 bucket into Postgres and then visualizing it with PowerBI or scripting a python program. You really only get back how much you put into it. If you just barely scrape by the whole time and don't focus on coding, that first technical interview out of college is going to be a mean surprise. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions, would be happy to answer them.",

    "postText": "So I recently got admitted to the Nursing program at Chico as a transfer and I'm currently trying to find housing since I live 2 1/2 hours from campus. The only issue is, because the Nursing program sends out their acceptances so late, I only committed to the school recently. I am trying to look for housing on campus, but I couldn't help but notice that there was a priority deadline by April 16th. They state on the website you can still apply for housing after but I just won't be part of the priority list. Is it hard to find housing if you've applied after the priority deadline? I also know that transfers only get on-campus housing from Konkow and UV and I'm not sure if the bedspaces fill up easily. I'm really  hoping to get on-campus housing that is monitored by staff mainly for security reasons and somethings that isn't coed.",

Especially since this upcoming school year Whitney hall will be shut down displacing a lot of incoming freshman that have to be rehoused. Honestly for the price and your freedom , get off campus housing. It also tends to be cheaper than paying for on campus housing or off campus dorms. 90% of chico state students live within 2 miles of campus. You\u2019re better off finding a 1 or two bedroom apartment between ($1000-1300 a month) (studios can cost less) .\n\nI am a transfer student (transferred in fall 2021) . I\u2019ve had friends live at the dorms both on and off campus and they all hated it for various reason like privacy, ability to do what you want, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve lived off campus since moving up to chico and honestly I\u2019d suggest look for housing now because summer properties are becoming available (for July/august move in dates) you should try and secure a place at the latest end of May for best chance as maybe people who graduate leave at the end of May and a lot more apartments and housing become available. Also look in to getting roommates to help keep your cost low or if you have a significant other ask them to move with you\n\nAlso if you\u2019re concerned about security just don\u2019t live near the train tracks and stay out of alleyway housing (housing that\u2019s behind front main houses) . Chico is relatively safe just remember to lock your door and your car . Maybe invest in a dog? If you\u2019re really concerned maybe live farther from campus on the other side of town where there\u2019s more families . There\u2019s also a lot of apartment complexes that have gated entrances with codes.",

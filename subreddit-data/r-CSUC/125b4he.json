She has a really full plate including being a full time grad student in terms of units and a required internship which requires 16+ hours a week of work. \nShe does a lot, but this is what she really wants so in her mind it is worth it. Is there any questions specifically you\u2019d like answered that I could ask her?",

She didn\u2019t get in at first (pretty competitive) but eventually they had extra room in the program. She loves the faculty and the curriculum. \n\nThe cost is pretty manageable. It\u2019s a state school so its cheap compared to other schools. But also, there are a lot of programs she takes advantage of that help her financially like Fellowships, Scholarships, Summer Research Programs etc.",

It really depends on the classes you would end up taking, but there seems to be a good number of writing assignments that could take up quite a bit of your time depending on how you work through them",

    "postText": "I'm a Chico State alumnus in Chico and I'm not a coder, but I want to test some Python and Java packages (spaCy, AllenNLP, openNLP, StanfordNLP). I'm having issues installing them and getting them to work (except spaCy, I got that to work easily). Might be an environment issue, not sure.\n\nI'll pay $25/hour ($50 minimum, $100 max, cash) to help me get these packages working. Can meet on campus or off. Miriam library or cafe. Prefer week of Jan 13.\n\nI'm using a MacBook Pro, Mojave v10.14.6",

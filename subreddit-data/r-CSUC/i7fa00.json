            "comment": "Remember that Ryzen, i5, and i7 are little more than brand names and tell you nothing about the performance of the actual processor.\n\nAt the moment, a lot of AMD's newer Ryzen series are outperforming their Intel counterparts,  and they process the same instructions and so run the same programs. So to answer your question, almost certainly yes. Just make sure the laptop you get fulfills the systems requirements of whatever program they want you to use for your class.",

    "postText": "I was looking around on the Chico site and I saw something about the Aleks PPL math assessment which is used to put you into a math class your first year. Is this mandatory? The reviews on the extension I have to download are terrible with most people rating it 1 star saying that it was taking info from your computer, 1 hour wait time despite paying to schedule, etc. Are there any computer science majors here that had to take the Aleks PPL? I took pre-calc already and have high SAT and CAASP math scores. Will they require me to take the exam on the spot at orientation if I don't complete it?",

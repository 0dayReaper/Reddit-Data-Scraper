Your participation is completely anonymous and is appreciated. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for participating! Your school was in the top 5 that responded. Some people have asked to see the data once completed so here is a brief summary and the graphs for each question: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVPGKLU-fal2Rb6GfQz6m5ZkaZ\\_\\_orSV\\_5\\_p0N4CuCA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVPGKLU-fal2Rb6GfQz6m5ZkaZ__orSV_5_p0N4CuCA/edit?usp=sharing)",

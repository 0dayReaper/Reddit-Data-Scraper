    "postText": "I'm going to apply to Chico this year! and it's really confusing because of everything happening this year. Does anyone know how they are going to college admissions this year? I heard that the SAT doesn't matter this year because COVID, but I haven't heard anything else yet.  \nAny info will be appreciated!",

[The SAT and ACT test requirement is suspended for students applying for admission in fall 2021 as freshmen](https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/Pages/first-time-freshman-faq.aspx). That link is for the freshmen FAQ, but [here's the link for the general FAQ that says the same thing](https://www2.calstate.edu/coronavirus/Pages/frequently-asked-questions-coronavirus.aspx).",

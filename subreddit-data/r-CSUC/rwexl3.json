I don\u2019t think my brain can take any more online school. 2 weeks wouldn\u2019t be TOO horrible, but if it\u2019s extended indefinitely I might have to drop out.\n\n(To people downvoting, you should just go to an online school if you want to be online so bad)",

I\u2019ve heard San Diego state and some UC are going virtual for ahwile which sucks &amp; is not good news.\n\nAt least we have a few weeks before school starts to hopefully have covid more sorted out, but being online again is going to be a bitch. (If we start online, I feel like professors are going to get comfortable and not want to go back)\n\nOne of my classes even went online recently\u2026 \ud83e\udd2c",

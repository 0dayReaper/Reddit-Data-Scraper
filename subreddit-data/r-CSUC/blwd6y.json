    "postText": "Yesterday my friend and I toured at Cedar Flats, and thought everything was super nice. We filled out an application and gave them $200 each for it. $50 for application, $50 for co-signer application, and a $100 deposit. We were recommended these apartments by my friend\u2019s mom, so we didn\u2019t really look at online reviews before applying. However, last night we decided to read reviews on google and yelp and they were terrible. People are saying that Cedar Flats scams people by lying that most utilities are paid even though they\u2019re not. They say that management sucks and you\u2019re overcharged for everything. Now my friend and I are really worried, should we not sign a lease?",

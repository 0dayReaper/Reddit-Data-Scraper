But it runs all your transcript info against ALL US schools. \n\nAlternatively, you can call UC Berkeley's admissions and talk to a counselor, but it sounds like if you are here you've probably done that and they were useless or stingy with information.",

I\u2019ll defiantly call the counselors at both Berkeley and mine at Chico to see what courses I should take, thanks for the help!",

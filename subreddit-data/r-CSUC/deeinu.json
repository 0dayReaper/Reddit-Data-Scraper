I had transcripts from 4 junior colleges I had to submit.  Each one costs a few bucks and takes about a 2 weeks for delivery.  Get an unofficial copy for your own records while you're at it.\n\nIf you don't already know what classes are transferable you've got some catching up to do.  There's a couple websites run by the CSU/UC system that will tell you what classes are accredited/transferable.  If you need more help make an appointment with an undergrad adviser ASAP and have all your unofficial transcripts available for the meeting.  They'll figure it out for you.\n\nOrientation is worth the time if it's convenient - but it's not necessary.  Registration is not done at orientation.  Your dates will be given to you via the Student Portal.  As a xfer middle classman expect to be the lowest priority.",

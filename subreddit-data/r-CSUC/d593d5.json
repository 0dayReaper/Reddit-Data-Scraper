I saw a couple different frat houses outside their houses in force in all matching shirts grilling\n\nI kinda wanted to pledge a fraternity but didn\u2019t know how to go about it? And it\u2019s kinda hard since I commute",

            "comment": "FYI, Don't call them \"Frats\".  Only the assholes will call you out for saying it, but you'll see it in their eyes.  It's generally considered overly familiar at best and disrespectful at worst.\n\nUniversity professors have guidelines on how to refer to the university for the same reason.  School policy says professors shouldn't use the term Chico State.  Proper use is CSUC, CSU Chico, or California State University Chico.   Sac State has the same rules.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's rules about what fraternities can do to recruit members.  The front yard BBQ is an open invitation to bring over friends, and friends of friends to meet new people and strike up a conversation.\n\nIf you see a greek wearing letters on campus it's usually because there's some kind of event going on.  That would be a good time to introduce yourself to any classmates wearing them.\n\nBeing a long distance student shouldn't be a barrier (but it will be for some).  Any group that puts their membership process ahead of your academic success isn't worth your attention.\n\nI hated the cookie cutter fraternities when I rushed.  You meet one guy and all the rest are variations of the same.  If you don't conform they aren't interested.  I suggest asking how many international students or first generation college students are in their organization.\n\nI think diversity a good indicator of what how tolerant/accommodating/flexible/open minded (pick your favorite adjective) a group they are.  I was interested in a wide range of personalities, perspectives, advice and networking.  I liked having some country boys, GQ boys, jolly stoners, athletes, dean's list students, transfer students, funny Scandinavians, friendly Arabs, urban minorities, suburban whites, straight, gay, etc......",

You got today and tomorrow to leave an impression to get invited to the invite only dinners on Thursday. Make every conversation meaningful as possible and talk to as many people as possible. That\u2019s my advice to you. Also don\u2019t be afraid to approach them, this week especially it\u2019s highly encouraged and we are happy to have a talk with you.",

A browse through r/scams will give you an idea of how they operate.\n\nIt's likely a scam if:\nThe pay seems too good to be true.\nThey send you a check for supplies (from their own distributor or someone you choose) and ask you to send the rest back.\nThey interview or communicate over Telegram, Whatsapp, or Discord\n\nEven if they claim to be from a reputable company and show you their website, that means nothing. \n\nThere's more red flags, but these are the ones off the top of my head. Go check out r/scams, be safe, and good luck!",

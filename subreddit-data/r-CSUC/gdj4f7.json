I know people love to party here and I like that scene too but what other social activities does Chico have to offer? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "To the best of my knowledge, transfers aren't able to live on campus except possibly University Village which isn't technically on campus but is owned by Chico State. There isn't even enough space for all freshmen to live on campus. Plus it's really expensive to live in University housing and you don't even get your own room or kitchen. And you have to leave campus for breaks and summer so if you don't want to go home every break, it might not be the best option. If you live on campus, you would be there for 9 months which winds up being costing between $850 and $1,100 per month depending on the room. Living off campus will typically cost between $400 and $600 a month and is thousands of dollars cheaper for the whole year than 9 months in student housing. If you want to live off campus, students are always looking for roommates. You can find rooms on Chico State Facebook housing groups if you want to try that option. Most of them are really close to campus which is right by downtown so it gives you many social options. And there are a lot of campus clubs and outdoor activities in and around Chico\n\nEDIT: Triple and quad rooms on campus are less expensive, about $600 to $850 a month for 9 months. My math above was based on double rooms",

He has been at Poly for a year and has decided to transfer to Chico State where I am going now because he likes the vibe (and the rent prices) much better. A lot of incoming freshman love Poly SLO though, but it's not very transfer friendly. Also, depending on where you live now, Chico's food scene is not great, but there are some gems. I highly recommend Chico!",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, LA has all the kind of food you can think of, all the shows and concerts, and so much more. But I would never live there because of how bad the traffic is over there. That is a big reason why I didn\u2019t put Cal State Fullerton as one of the schools I want to transfer too. Also rent is extremely expensive, and since so many people want to live in or close to LA, the rent in Ventura County is also expensive but not like LA expensive. To rent a room in Ventura is around $700-$950 a month, so I can only imagine how much a room is in LA. My husband and I got lucky and only pay $400 for a studio because my parents property came with two houses and a studio. \nVentura County has its traffic, but not as bad as LA and its beautiful. It has everything as in hiking trails, punch bowls, rivers, beaches, etc. The city of Ventura has a beach and a cute main street with tons of bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. Also, the weather in Ventura is the best! Unfortunately, the price in rent is causing alot of people to move out of Southern CA, which is why I am going more North. I will miss the weather and the Mexican food, but I am ready for something new. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re into punk music, the punk scene is huge in Ventura County. Oxnard (city in VC) is known for Nardcore music.",

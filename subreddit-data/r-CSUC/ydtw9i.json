    "postText": "I got into the Chico State CS program, which I'm cautiously-optimistic for. I've read loads of great things about it and that the social scene here is great--lots of hiking, nature, outdoorsy stuff.\n\nI'm super nervous though because I don't know how to swim, bike, camp, hike, or literally any outdoor-related activity. I am the stereotypical CS nerd lol.\n\nI guess I want to know two things: Are there groups that can teach me to do any of these things so I can participate? What do the homebodies do for fun at Chico? I want my experience to be something where I put myself out there and try new things. :)",

I\u2019d suggest making good friends with those you\u2019re forming with (assuming you\u2019re dorming). Most people all go on adventures together because the universe will force you to.\n\nIf you are not dorming, that\u2019s okay too. Go to thr WREC and check out the rock climbing wall in the late afternoon or early evening. It\u2019ll be packed with new faces and good energy. You\u2019re bound to meet the right people there.\n\nBest of luck!!\n\n-Alum",

Most of my good friends i've met here I met from things like philosophy and electrical engineering clubs. It depends on what you are looking for, in the beginning of the semester they have events where all the clubs table on campus. Check it out! Theres also wildcats connect to see events going on",

    "postText": "I am a transfer student and found housing on Nord Avenue Apartments. While looking at the complex on \n\nGoogle Maps I notice that there are train tracks next to the complex.  I have  a few questions about living next to train tracks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Has anyone live on Nord Avenue Apartments? How often do trains pass by during the day and night?\n2. Are trains constantly passing by?\n3. How often do you wake up in the middle of your sleep due to a train passing by?\n4. Is it worth it living next to train tracks in order to be close to campus?\n5. Any regrets living next to train track?\n\nThanks",

I'd recommend avoiding them if you are a light sleeper or easily bothered by random noise. They are frequent but I don't recall how much so.. several times a day.",

All other trains are freight, and the frieght trains and not scheduled so they can come by any time day or night.\n2. From what I can tell, there's seems to be an average of one train every hour or so. This is Union Pacific's main west coast line, and it's busy.\n3. I'm not a heavy sleeper, but I was able to sleep through the trains fine. You get used to it.\n4. Yes.\n5. My only regret is getting the room I got. My room was directly adjacent to Nord Ave, which gets traffic 24/7. This car traffic was far worse than train traffic, because people are shitty drivers. Horns, big semis, the loud high pitched whine of a turbo diesel, the sport bike, those mustang drivers who can not make a single acceleration from a light without revving.",

I lived right next to them and I remember there were times when you could even feel the train shacking but our apartment overlooked the tracks. There were like a couple trains in the night.",

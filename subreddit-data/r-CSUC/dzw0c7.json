The young Republicans brought two speakers to an event in the BMU that are right wing and antagonists (if you look at my link in the thread, you will see the founder of the group walk away, Brandon Straka dressing as Hitler and then as a native American). They exist to make money off book sales/speaking tours and say inflammatory stuff. This event brought proud boys out. This is amidst a recent history of student activists and other non white folks worried about racism on campus and in the city.",

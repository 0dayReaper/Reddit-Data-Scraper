The streets, not the avenues\u2014the epicenter was at 5th &amp; Ivy, where someone threw a couch into the intersection and\u2014of course\u2014some dumfuk lit it on fire. What followed was as primal and barbaric a scene I have ever witnessed. (I was watching from a distance. Riots and tribal anarchy are not really my thing.)\n\nOh, BTW, the cops totally let that riot happen. In the late afternoon, they trolled up and down streets, breaking up small parties, sending lots of drunk people into the streets.\n\nThen, the cops vanished.\n\nA couple hours later, the riots had started. You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to see the logic: send 'em into the streets and give them a couple more hours to get *really* drunk with nowhere to go. Then: riots, followed by cancellations and crackdowns.",

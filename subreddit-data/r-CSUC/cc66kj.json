The rooms are larger than the other dorms on campus, and everyone I\u2019ve known who lived there stayed close with everyone they lived in Mechoopda with. Don\u2019t discount it just because it isn\u2019t Whitney!",

            "comment": "Its nice, close enough to campus that its only a couple minute walk and you dont have to deal with fire alarms and the stairs like on campus dorms. I only went to mechoopda a couple times but I distinctly remember my first experience because it was probably the rowdiest dorm I ever saw so Ill share the story. I had just got a new roommate in sutter(he got kicked out of mechoop) and after about 10 minutes of talking to him he told me to come with him mechoop to go get his bong to bring it to my dorm. So we walkin there and in the parking lot a huge group of mechoop kids get out of some car, notice I have a jacket on, and ask me to put the bong under my jacket to get passed the front desk. So walkin into mechoop there practically a party going on in like the space where like 4 dorms kinda connect, black chicks twerkin on the wall, some kids but ass naked gettin head in a open dorm and people kept walkin in and out laughin at him, some other shit was goin down i dont remember but shit was wild. \n\nAnd rowdiest of a dorm will always depend on whos living there, like esken is a clone of mechoop and it wasnt nearly as crazy.",

There's a lot of crime (muggings, car theft, burglary, one rape) that's reported at that intersection (Warner and East Sac) and those complexes. I'm not sure how Shasta/Lassen compare. I commute from outside of Chico, so my experiences are pretty limited to what I see when I'm on campus.",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm a transfer student which I got put on the waitlist for UV but I'm number 2 so I'm trying not to worry. But two of my friends that I had met through the roommate selection they want to just live off-campus. But I just want to hear thoughts on UV so I can narrow my decision down.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s going to be a very difficult find housing off campus that is close to the school, impossible if your roommates were thinking of getting a place together (you\u2019d have an easier time finding a room for just yourself). The housing crisis because of the past fire is no joke. 2nd on the waitlist is pretty safe I think. It\u2019s almost August and almost all places are full. You could find luck off campus, but just be cautious.",

We're from the Santa Rosa area, so we saw the housing crisis there. It's nothing different here. I'd suggest on campus housing if at all possible. The off campus housing scene isn't going to get better anytime soon.",

However, #2 on the waitlist is a for sure you will get in. People drop out everyday they just wait to panic mid-August and un-enroll.",

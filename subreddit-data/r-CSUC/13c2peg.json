    "postText": "So I\u2019m going to Chico in the fall as a freshman and I\u2019m super excited! However, my dream school is UCSB, which i didn\u2019t get into. My plan is to spend 2 years at Chico and graduate from SB.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a good amount of UC-transferable classes? And, if you know, is it easy to get into a UC from Chico?\n\nI\u2019m going to talk to a counselor about this too, I just thought I\u2019d ask here cause it would reassure me a bit :)\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "To be honest I think you would have better luck going to community college for those two years rather than a university. Not to mention the fact that it would be a heck of a lot cheaper. There are much more clearly defined transfer agreements between community colleges and CSU/UC schools, where you can see exactly which classes will transfer. It can be a real hassle (but not impossible) to transfer classes between universities. Check [assist.org](https://assist.org) for more info on that.",

Your best chance at ever being a student at UCSB is by transferring there from a community college. Especially if you do so from a local community college that has a TAG agreement.",

You have to petition to get credit for them and have to bring a copy of the syllabus and course work to see if they are equivalent.\n\n**Only community colleges have agreements with public colleges in California.**\n\nIf you're looking to keep your options open, then you **MUST** attend a community college. It doesn't matter which community college- pick one close to home to save money.\n\nYou also have to ask yourself, why you want to go to UCSB. Is it the party scene? The campus? Or do they have an excellent program for your major.\n\nAlso, a lot of CCs have a \"tag\" with UCSB for more obscure/less popular majors.\n\nTo sum it up: Don't go to a CSU if you want to transfer to any other CSU or UC",

Talking to an advisor from UCSB is preferable over one from the school you are attending. \n\nAlso worth noting that UCSB highlights that they prioritize transfers from CCs over other schools. \n\nSide-note, isn't Merced a commuter school? So wouldn't your overall experience be comparable to a CC regardless?  \n\nEven though UCSB has a high transfer acceptance, you have to be prepared to get rejected. Would you be comfortable staying at Merced for four+ years?",

I appreciate it.\n\nUC Merced is not a commuter school, it\u2019s just really big, but to answer your question, no, I don\u2019t want to graduate from UC Merced if I can help it. \n\nI talked to my dad and he says we shouldn\u2019t even keep a CC as an option. I\u2019m going to email an advisor from UCSB and see what they say, but I\u2019m not ruling out going to a CC even if my dad is.\n\nIn terms of rejection, I\u2019m definitely thinking about it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m worried about what school I should attend just in case they DO say no. Although, I\u2019m not just going to apply to UCSB, I\u2019ll apply to some of my other top-choices so I\u2019ll (hopefully) have options.\n\nThanks again, I appreciate you taking the time, this is really helpful!

    "postText": "1507 W 5th St Chico 95928.\n\nCurrently looking for 1 person to take over my room. It would be a lease assumption. I am moving out on 12/19.  The lease last until mid June then you can choose to renew or terminate it.\n\nLook at the pictures posted to get a good idea of the house, google maps helps a lot as well. There is a washer/dryer, big driveway to park and pets are allowed as long as you put them on the lease.\n\nRent is $616 a month. Not including garbage, Wi-Fi and PG&amp;E. If you include all of those its usually around $700.\n\nIf interested, please respond on reddit, email me at [pantheon144@gmail.com](mailto:pantheon144@gmail.com) or text/call me at 916-671-9616.\n\nI can provide more info on the lease, more pictures and a tour of the house if needed.",

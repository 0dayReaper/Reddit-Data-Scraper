I have been involved in sports for most of my life and knowing that Chico is a smaller school, I was wondering if they have a hockey team/organization or even a rink nearby. I found the Facebook page of the old team but it seems to be inactive, but I thought I'd ask anyways.",

            "comment": "Chico HAD a roller hockey team which was dissolved in 2020 right before/ during covid. My brother in law was on the team up until it was dissolved and my fianc\u00e9 played roller hockey against chico state while attending a community college that was in the same division. They had a rink out in hamilton city which then was shut down because of lack of renovations and funding. The team tried to carry on and have their own practices on the street but it was just dissolved because players quit or graduated (and also covid prevented tournaments and games) and there wasn\u2019t enough interest to keep it going. If you want to play ice hockey I suggest going to a school out in the Midwest or on the east coast. If you\u2019re interested in roller hockey go to ASU, UCSB, or SJSU (those are teams I can remember off the top of my head) . My fianc\u00e9 played ice hockey and roller hockey his whole life, and for those commenting to go play Rec at skate town in Sacramento/roseville, don\u2019t do it unless you want to skate on shitty unkept Ice (per my fianc\u00e9s words/experience)",

Unfortunately, I did not get accepted to many other in-state colleges so I don't really have many other options. I have like 3 days to decide whether I want to go to community college or Chico State and I am struggling to weigh the pros &amp; cons.",

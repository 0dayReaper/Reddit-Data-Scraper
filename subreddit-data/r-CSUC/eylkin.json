    "postText": "Hello! I applied and was accepted into CSU Chico recently as a Theatre Major, though I am looking to double major in english in the future, as well. I have a few questions I would like to ask about the campus to make my decision easier. I would enjoy hearing your inside opinions and answers to the questions if you have the time. You don't have to answer them, but it would really help me :)) !!\n\nFeel free to answer any ones you want to :))\nYou don't have to answer them all!\n\nHow is the general attitude of the people you meet on the campus and encounter from day-to-day?\n1.5) Is there any school-wide events that take place that are enjoyable and act as a social must-attend?\n\n2) Is there anything special about the campus you enjoy?\n\n2.5) Do you feel safe on campus?\n\n3) Is there a DND club on campus?\n\n3.5) What do you dislike and like about the school?\n\n4) Are the dorm living conditions meet your expectations? Are apartments after freshman year affordable around the area?\n\n4.5) Is there anything you would change about the community to better your experience?\n\n5) How are the shows put on by the theatre department if you have seen them? Are they enjoyable (if you have seen them)? Is the cast and experience worthwhile (for theatre majors)?\n\n6) How is the English department (for English majors)?\n\n7) Is the campus busy a lot of the time? Do you find yourself overwhelmed by the number of people you have met and seen?\n\n8) How are campus professors and staff?\n\n9) Is there a health care center on campus and could I refill any previous prescriptions there?\n\n10) What are the best activities to do with friends on campus? What's your favorite hangout place and why\n\nThank you so much!- Me",

            "comment": "1) 9/10 times I\u2019ve had great interactions with strangers and student employees. Chico is known for its social aspect. There\u2019s a clique for everyone and if you\u2019re not into cliques, that doesn\u2019t matter either. You just have to search for what you want, or sometimes it just comes to you. \n\n1.5) Often there are concerts/shows downtown and a lot of people talk about/attend them. There are also shows on campus every now and then, and with that RAs host events for freshmen. Once you move off campus, you\u2019ll need to figure it out a bit more, but it isn\u2019t tough. You\u2019ll know what I mean when you get here.\n\n2) I\u2019ve fallen in love with the trees and casual attitude of our students. I\u2019ll find students snoring and asleep on the lawns, other students just straight vibing in the library, or just like tonight, I went downtown to Woodstock\u2019s with some of my classmates and we grabbed some beers and pizzas and played some games, listened to music, etc. The city is super easy going\n\n2.5) yes, but you can\u2019t be too careful. Campus police sends messages every time there is a crime committed and keeps students up to date. There\u2019s a large homeless population, but I\u2019ve never had a problem with them. Except one time I offered a lady $5 and she called me an asshole, so idek what that was about... but yea, I feel safe. I could walk through campus at 3am and there\u2019s a police cruiser chilling by the library or driving around most times. \n\n3) I haven\u2019t checked, but most likely yes. There\u2019s 2 or 3 clubs downtown. I\u2019m sure a discord exists for such scenarios. I play with my roommates sometimes. \n\n3.5) while the campus is fairly liberal, the community is built on traditional ideology, and agriculture is a huge part of the culture. With that come conservative ideology. Often, students will butt heads and administration gets involved. It\u2019s a tolerable mess, but can be annoying when it\u2019s right in front of you... I\u2019m just trying to get my degree, man. Leave me be.\n\n4) yes and yes. I lived in Konkow and loved it. If you want to party, go to Whitney. If you want to have something in between, go to Esken, Mechoopda, Lassen, or Shasta. If you want a quieter area, go to Konkow or Sutter. Off campus living exists for first years too, and often mocks dorm life, but again, is off campus. Post dorm is nice. You have a choice of getting a Chico style home built in 19-fucking-07, or you could go with a standard apartment or townhome. If you\u2019re boujee , you could always find a nicer home.\n\n\n4.5) Homeless people aren\u2019t treated well. I don\u2019t want them on the street, but i don\u2019t want them kicked out either. Otherwise, we\u2019re chilling. Downtown can get loud on weekends from the party culture- but it\u2019s an amazing university and community otherwise.\n\n5) I haven\u2019t seen any unfortunately, but all my theatre friends I\u2019ve met through the honors program and are really talented, amazing people.  \n\n6) can\u2019t speak on the English Dept. I\u2019m a Nursing student.\n\n7)  busy but never *too* busy. I\u2019ve never felt overwhelmed by the amount of people unless it\u2019s finals week in the library. ^^(Trinity Hall\u2019s gallery is always empty during finals week... go there)\n\n8)  professors and staff are 9/10 times top notch. They have their job for a reason. \n\n9) I don\u2019t see why not \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Just see the doctor and see what they say\n\n10) if you take an art class you get access to the wood shop and workshop. Lots of art students hang out there, and the shop head is a great dude. Dave- gotta love him. I learned how to MIG weld in 2 days. Otherwise, the campus has tons of areas to sit and work, but I can\u2019t really think of a definitive area set solely for socializing except in the dorm areas. Otherwise, there are a TON of resources for students with all types of needs. If you can think of it, a resource exists for it. As a nursing student, I\u2019ve done a deep analysis of that and it\u2019s true. \n\n\nI hope this helps",

            "comment": "I graduated two years ago, but I'm also from (and still live in) Chico so I figured I'd answer anyway.\n\n1) I never had any negative interactions with people on campus. I preferred to mind my own business outside of classes and working with friends/classmates on group projects in stuff, but if I was ever approached by someone on campus it was usually friendly. I can't name any \"must-attend\" type things, but there's always something happening on campus.\n\n2) What I love about the campus is the architecture of the older buildings (Kendall, Trinity, Laxon, Colusa, Ayers) and the campus itself is an arboretum so there's a lot of beautiful trees and it's bisected by a creek. That natural feeling makes for a real peaceful experience when going about your day, IMO.\n\n3) I would imagine so, but I don't have any personal knowledge of or experience with one.\n\n3.5) The thing I disliked the most might be the campuses growing cultural tendency to prioritize non academic stuff. Like, most universities pride themselves on their academic reputations, the Chico faculty and administration are more interested in what their latest social justice accomplishment is and a lot of the student body seems more interested in the party scene.\n\n4) I never lived in the dorms but I had friends and family who did and they had good experiences. Each dorm has a different atmosphere so that's something you can look into more when the time comes. Apartments are a different story, they were expensive pre-Camp Fire and now they're getting outrageous, not to mention impacted.\n\n4.5) Can you be more specific? Do you mean the campus community or the city of Chico as a whole?\n\n5) I knew some theater folks who really enjoyed the program and it seems like their productions are at least decently well attended.\n\n6) My sister majored in English and Psych, she loved the English department and her experience in it, but she said it also kind of bummed her out because the lack of support it gets financially and from the broader academic community. STEM subjects are kind of a sacred cow right now, so things like English Lit fall by the wayside, when she was in the program from 2009-2013 there were six professors on faculty, and there was a shrinking focus on the classics. Which is disappointing. When I think of English Literature I think of focusing on the monumental pieces of the subject matter from Dickens to Melville and so on. That seems to be less and less the case lately.\n\n7) Depends on the time of day and year. You'll see it ebb and flow, there will be a ton of students passing through the campus around 10am or 3pm and fewer at earlier and later times of days. You also might notice that spring semester is a little lighter than fall semester, that's because not as many people return after their first semester here. They transfer or drop out because they're homesick or would just prefer a different program at a different school.\n\n8) There's a mix. Some are great, some are forgettable, others might be a bit on the mean side. All the professors in my program were fun and interesting, I had an English professor who wasn't great, but he was the only one who ever stood out in a negative light.\n\n9) Yes the campus health center is available for most student health needs. It's across the street from Whitney Hall on Warner Ave.\n\n10) On campus there's the WREC which isn't just a gym, but they have pools and climbing walls and all kinds of stuff. There are also all kinds of clubs to be involved with who meet outside of class and do activities together. Sometimes they're related to a major, sometimes they're just for kicks. Really though you should see what the broader community has to offer and not just the school. Chico's an outdoor community, so there's the park, there are lakes nearby, rivers for fishing, people go tubing down the Sac and Butte Creek during the summer, camping, etc.",

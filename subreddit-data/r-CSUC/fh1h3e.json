    "postText": "Everyone should be getting emails from the school about it. I've been told that teachers should be trying to make it so nothing is due during the cancellation, but ask your teachers individually, some are trying to get permission to email a take home exam if they were planned for Friday, for example. \n\nSide note from me: 3 extra days will not change anything in reality. Keep checking your email to see if the cancellation is extended. \n\nStay safe everyone, wash your hands! Have a good break\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.csuchico.edu/coronavirus/stories/class-cancellation-mar11.shtml](https://www.csuchico.edu/coronavirus/stories/class-cancellation-mar11.shtml)",

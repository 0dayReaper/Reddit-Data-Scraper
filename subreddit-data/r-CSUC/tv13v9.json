    "postText": "I work for a high school (but also a chico alum) and I have a student attending chico in the fall. She applied to live in theSocial and she\u2019ll be doing the Liberal Art multi subject Credential combined program. She got into EOP (first gen and low income) but her mom still has concerns. First, mom thinks the program might be too hard, second, she thinkings she won\u2019t be able to afford living over there and told the student she needs to have at least 10-20 grand in scholarships. I guess my question is, has anyone done the Liberal Arts multi subject combined credential program? Any insights on it? Also, realistically she\u2019s getting topped out with fafsa, cal grants, etc. Does 10-20 grand sound a bit over the top for chico? I just want to help ease both my student and her moms mind about going to college.",

            "comment": "Not trying to be cheeky but here's a great breakdown of expected fees and expenses while attending csu chico\n\n https://www.csuchico.edu/fa/cost/\n\nEven with scholarships, yes, there is still a significant financial investment in attending any CSU program\n\n*added - luckily there are a lot of on campus jobs and other work opportunities in the area as well for students to supplement food/rent costs, but I think it's realistic to say that a student loan will probably be necessary and is normal to continue paying off years after graduating\n\n- everyone's situation is totally different, but if you have the opportunity to attend university full time I think it is still highly recommended and will only help in the long run",

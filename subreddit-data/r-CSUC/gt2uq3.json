    "postText": "I'm looking for someone to take over my lease at Westpark Plaza. It's a 2 bed 1 bath, but my roommate is planning on staying so one bedroom is already occupied. Rent will be $550 a month for one person (water and garbage included) plus utilities, and the security deposit would be $500. I'm already in the process of moving out so whoever takes over can start moving in whenever.",

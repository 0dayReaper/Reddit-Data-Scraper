    "postText": "Hey Guys I\u2019m sure this has been asked before but I\u2019m considering transferring to Chico from a CC. I\u2019m a computer science major and was wondering how the programs are here? Also wanted to know if anyone transferred in and found it easy to meet people, make friends, find jobs etc. Finally how it chico? Do you have any regrets or issues? \nThanks!",

I have friends who have been looking for months and still haven't found a place to live. Definitely lock down a place to live before you move here.",

The rent prices are expensive and cost of living is a bit high for what you're getting.\n\nBut, that being said, Chico is very friendly and there is always room at the table.\n\nEdit : they lost a long time professor this semester and were unable to hire the lecturers they needed (2 I believe), which is why the entire department is over stretched. It sucks, I'm not saying the curriculum is bad. I'd only even say two teachers specifically are bad.",

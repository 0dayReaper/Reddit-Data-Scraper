    "postText": "Some of my coworkers and I go to bars in downtown Chico on the weekends  sometimes. We've noticed that people act a little different around us  but we have not figured out what it is exactly. We wear civilian clothing but I do wear a cool bomber jacket with camo print on it that was bought at a normal retailer. Do military and  civilians that work on a military base have a bad reputation in Chico?  Your wisdom and enlightenment will be appreciated !",

I really don\u2019t think your, uh, regular camo bomber jacket from a normal store is going to get you profiled or the victim of prejudice in any way anywhere.",

But I would think that a lot of the liberal students at CSU have conservative country folk family members that do things like hunting, joining the military, etc. Therefore, they would like my camo print bomber jacket and vibe well with me.",

Cause I\u2019ve been at Chico state for 3 years now and have had 3 different on campus jobs between stateside and AS and they give about 10-12 hours a week because they will hire multiple people for the same position and have to split hours evenly . I worked for conference service through AS , and two different student assistant positions through the college of natural sciences, and only got 10?hours a week because it\u2019s a 40 hour work week and they hire 4-5 people so there\u2019s variability and people to cover in case people get sick or can\u2019t make it. Especially if you\u2019re a student assistant and not working in the WREC, Butte station , or food service through marketplace or sutter hall you won\u2019t get more than 10-12 hours a week.  So don\u2019t speak on something you don\u2019t know about or haven\u2019t experienced PERSONALLY\n\nI\u2019ve also had many friends go through the same issue as I have with the lack of available hours. Also if you\u2019re not working for AS and you work stateside (which is the school itself) they prefer you to have work study because outside of the college of business and natural sciences the departments don\u2019t have it in their budget to pay students out of pocket so it goes based on workstudy and you can only work as much as you\u2019ve been granted for work study and if the department has a little to spend you can work more. Do your research or ask people who know the actual information/ have been through it. Bc it seems like you haven\u2019t",

Because they\u2019re so popular and give good hours people stay long term and maybe an opening or two open per year. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 60% of the jobs on campus. Doesn\u2019t make a difference if there are little to no openings",

            "comment": "[Have you read through the Loan FAQ from StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized)?\n\nRE:Loans - \n\nIf you are in school and it's a direct loan, you are not obligated to make payments on the loan while in school and up to 6 months after you leave school *for whatever reason*.\n\nIf it's a subsidized loan, the federal government will pay the interest on the loan while you are attending school. If it's an unsubsidized loan then you are responsible for the interest. *This still doesn't mean you're obligated to pay the interest* - if you do not pay the interest while you are in school it will be added to the principal (original loan) amount when you leave school. \n\nThe principal amount is what interest is based off of, so the less principal you have then the less you are charged in interest. This is one reason why it's suggested you take as few loans as possible (and for as little money as possible) and try to make payments on the principal even if you're not obligated to. If you reduce the principal amount before accruing interest on it then when you're finally paying interest you are making smaller payments overall. At 5% interest rate, a $5,000 loan is \n\nAs far as a minimum payment, it depends on a lot of different factors - what your interest rate is, what your principal amount is, what kind of repayment plan are you on, who \"owns\" your loan, etc. If it's a federal direct loan, interest rates are generally low (around 5%). Most loan servicers (companies you make payments to) have a minimum payment of $50 unless you enroll in a specific repayment program.\n\nHow much you pay overall depends on how quickly you pay it off. Below are a bunch of pictures from [a loan simulator (through StudentAid.gov)](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/wizard/personal-info/select-what-applies). I'm simulating it as a single person (not married), earning $50,000/yr, estimating a 2% income growth per year (typical cost of living/inflation), and the loan will have a 5% interest rate. You can click on the link and simulate what your loans might look like.\n\n- [$5,000 loan](https://i.imgur.com/ijJCfDQ.png): You will pay between $5,200 and $6,900 overall; $200 to $1,900 more than the original loan amount.\n- [$4,500 loan](https://i.imgur.com/QuIOtVc.png): You will pay between $4,700 and $6,200 overall; $200 to $1,700 more than the original amount.\n- [$4,000 loan](https://i.imgur.com/PI4HHNJ.png): You will pay between $4,100 and $5,500 overall; $100 to $1,500 more than the original amount.",

If so, consider starting at a community college and then transferring to Chico. If you want to live in the area so you can have the same quality of education and to get a feel for the region you can attend [Butte College](http://butte.edu/). Butte College is only 15-20 minutes away from Chico State and shares a LOT of instructors. Some of the classes taught by Butte are taught on Chico States campus. You'll have to secure housing off-campus (Butte doesn't have dorms), but honestly that's recommended if you want to save money when you attend Chico anyways.\n\nDepending on your financial need Butte can be extremely cheap. Even if you receive zero financial aid (no Pell Grant, Cal Grant, etc) and are reliant on loans exclusively, Butte College is around $1,400 for two 12 unit semesters (Full Time) as a California resident compared to Chico States $7,900. The cost drops off significantly if you qualify for financial aid. If you qualify for the California College Promise Grant your cost to enroll at Butte College would be $264/year. Butte College also has the Butte College Promise Scholarship, which offers free tuition and fees for your first two years. Even if your program of study isn't offered at Butte you can knock out almost all of your general education classes (math, some sciences, writing, etc) for way cheap. Butte also offers Cross Enrollment with Chico State, so once you get close to transferring you can take a class at Chico each semester without having to pay Chico prices.\n\nI really, really strongly recommend Butte if you don't have a reason to start at Chico. I started at Butte, so I'm totally biased, but I was in a similar position to you where I could not cover Chico State prices. Butte made college affordable and gave me the resources I needed in order to succeed at Chico. I've been able to earn quite a few scholarships at Chico thanks to my time at Butte. Some of those scholarships I earned before transferring.",

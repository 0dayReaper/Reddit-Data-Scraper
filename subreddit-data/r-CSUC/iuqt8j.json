    "postText": "Here's the deal: I'm not a professor, but I grade student work. And I see that many students  struggle incredibly hard to write clearly. There are numerous issues with clarity of expression, grammar, spelling, punctuation, in the majority of student work, even up to the 300 level (and possibly above).\n\nWhat I see is that professors are, in my opinion, too lenient about this. I am not blaming students for struggling with writing. I think it is a product of many factors, such as shortcomings in K-12 education, many people growing up bilingual and therefore having to switch between two languages, personal home stressors not supporting learning, the rise of tech displacing reading as a pastime (not a moralistic judgment), and other things.\n\nBut I also think that professors are doing students a disfavor by being lenient about writing. People are getting As and Bs (which mean \"exceeds expectations\" and \"superior work\") when their work, in terms of writing, is more like a C or even a D. Their thoughts are not clear and if they turn in resumes or written work for a job that looks like that, they are not going to get hired/will not be kept on.\n\nAdditionally, grade inflation is making degrees worth less. If people come out of college not able to write clearly, then employers will not take a degree from that institution seriously.\n\nAt the same time, students are stressed and get discouraged about a lot of negative feedback. In grading, I really try to give gentle and encouraging feedback, but sometimes someone's writing is so far from where I think it should be at a 200 or 300 level class, or in college at all, that I don't have time to coach people on every little thing. We also need to focus on course content, not writing. We encourage students to go to the writing center, but they often do not, whether due to being overwhelmed, confused, intimidated; I don't know.\n\nSo, if you are a student that struggles with writing - or think you might be, but are not getting feedback about it - what would help you? Do you want to know, or do you not care if your grade is inflated? How would you like to receive feedback about this in a way that is not discouraging?",

Getting responses on my essays, however \u201cdiscouraging\u201d the feedback is, is helpful on improving my writing for the future.",

Holy Shit. I can\u2019t believe how much I learned. \n\nFrom a teaching perspective this teacher forced us to use outlines. The way the course was built is brilliant.\n\nOutline of essay = 50 pts.\nRough draft of essay due following week =50pts.\nFinal essay due following week = 100 pts. \n\nBecause the prep steps were worth so much they had to be done. And doing the outline was a pain, but it made writing the rough draft the night before it was due an easy process and that made it even easier to turn in the final essay. \n\nThe teacher also really did a great job of teaching students how to read and glean material from the readings for the essay but I have been a huge fan of outlines ever since. \n\nChristina Dahl is probably the best English teacher in the area.",

I grade things that are full of typos, punctuation errors, incorrect word choice (like using \"confer\" to mean \"infer\" or treating antonyms as if they are synonyms), and frankly, sentences that I just do not understand. \n\nSome of this might be people getting nervous about homework and kind of letting that stress interfere with their clarity of writing, when it wouldn't be so hard if they weren't stressing. maybe? It's a guess. \n\nCome to think of it the vast majority of what I read on reddit is often clearer than some of the work I grade, though that is of course biased by which subs I choose to frequent. \n\nMaybe I could include this in a lesson somehow, when I get to be the professor someday...",

If you can get three ideas down on paper and fill those in the essays kind of write themselves. It really helps with organizing thoughts.\n\nI took this class with my son who at the time was a sophomore in high school and struggling with writing because our schools don\u2019t focus on that. He was intimidated by the process at the start of the semester and overwhelmed by the readings. By the end of the semester he was able to pick apart academic writing and create great essays.",

The issues I'm thinking of - which are fairly common - include things like not putting a space after a comma or period, or putting an unnecessary space before one. Also adding in unnecessary words and phrases and leaving out key explanatory phrases. So like if you wrote:\n\n\"Yeah ,probably an interactive course would help .Maybe even a crash course on basic grammar. But the issue at hand is that the grammar does indeed depend on the situation of the individual(s) in question.I myself had terrible teachers back then .\"\n\nI'm really not trying to diss anyone, but I don't understand why so many people don't seem to pick up on basic rules of punctuation like not putting unnecessary spaces before punctuation, and making sure to put one after. It just seems like the kinda thing we pick up by immersion. \n\nAnd then like in the example I gave, students will write \"back then\" to refer to 1) a former time in their life or 2) a previous time in history that could be decades or centuries ago without specifying when exactly they mean. \n\nAgain I really don't mean to put anyone down but I'm at a loss. How can I help people with stuff like this? \n\nI also feel like my hands are tied because I try to grade people down for this and the professors I grade for tell me to go easy on them. Which like I said seems to me like not doing anyone any favors.",

It drove me crazy that my son's writing in high school was not more highly critiqued.  When I would help edit his papers, I was ruthless - grammar, spelling, sentence structure, cohesive thoughts - I made him redo all of it.  When I was an entering freshman at UC Davis, we all had to take a writing test, and then based on those results were either allowed to move forward with regular class selection, or were forced to take a \"college writing\" class that had to be passed with a C or higher before we were allowed to register for any other English classes.  I never had issues with my writing in high school, always got As or Bs, so thought I would be in the clear, but even I was put into the \"remedial\" class.  I was pissed at first, but then ended up learning a lot.  This is something every college should do. \n\nSpeaking as a parent of a student at Chico, I want him to get critical feedback. If professors don't want a student's class grade lowered because of writing skills,  maybe there could be a separate grading component, and if you receive lower than a C in the \"writing skills\" portion, you are forced to do a session at the writing center to have it removed.",

    "postText": "How is math 121 at Chico State? It's been awhile since I've taken calculus, so I'm a bit nervous and trying to refresh my memory during the summer. Is there any tutoring available? Do professors allow walk-ins or would I have to schedule an appointment? What is the current textbook for this course? Is it James Stewart Calculus Eight edition? Any other tips for me? I just want to pass this class and get it over with.",

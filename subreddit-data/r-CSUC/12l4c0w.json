    "postText": "Hi! My daughter will be an incoming freshman this fall. I have two primary questions that I don\u2019t know how to address.\n\nShe\u2019s going to live on-campus and I would like to surprise her with gift cards for local stores and services so she doesn\u2019t have to use her own money, at least to start. Can any current students make any recommendations for either local places or franchises that are in the area (as well as delivery apps)? I\u2019d like to get her a mix of stuff.\n\nAlso, I am a single mom and will be moving her in, but she kind of needs to drive her car up (from Southern California) to help. I won\u2019t be able to drive two cars back, obviously, and we know she might not get a spot in the parking lottery. Are there any places in-town that rent out parking spots by the month that we can have in our back pocket as a Plan B?",

Safeway would be a good gift card option for groceries/gas, obviously basics like Target/Walmart since she'll have a car. \n\nIf she's downtown and will be eating down there pretty frequently, the Downtown Chico Business Association has a gift card that works at a ton of different downtown businesses: https://www.downtownchico.com/downtown-chico-gift-card.htm",

            "comment": "Gift cards: \nWalmart, target, Best Buy, safeway, for food maybe chilis or applebees? \n\nIn regards to the parking situation she will always be able to find a place to park for class as long as shes willing to get up a bit earlier to drive to campus (if she lives off campus). She\u2019ll either be able to park in one of the two parking structures sanctioned by the school, they also have a large parking lot next to the university stadium, a few back by the train tracks and she can even park downtown in one of the lots close to campus or the parking structure a few blocks away. if she lives  at university village which is an off campus dorm she\u2019ll have a parking spot (doesn\u2019t cost anything) or if she lives at one of the dorms on campus she will have an allocated spot in a lot specifically for dorm students you just have to pay the fee for the semester (not sure how much it costs) \n\nAlso if there\u2019s concerns about finding a parking spot on campus , with her student id she\u2019ll get to ride the public bus that has a partnership with Chico state to allow student to ride free to and from campus. However I suggest if she has a car you should bring it especially if she plans on working (needs reliable transportation) or wants to explore the area (which there\u2019s a lot to explore you just have to drive) she will need the car. \n\nHope this helps!",

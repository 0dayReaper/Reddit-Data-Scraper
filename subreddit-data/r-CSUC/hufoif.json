            "comment": "This is oversimplifying a very complex problem. They can't just stop maintaining the buildings/facilities; doing so would just create higher reopening cost for when they do eventually allow students back for in person classes. Because of this, there is very little (if any) cost savings on facilities. \n\nThe second biggest expense is the faculty salaries. They cant just stop paying the professors; you are still getting the same degree you are paying for, even if it isn't in the medium you were expecting. I agree it sucks to have to do all classes online, but the CSU system is already the most affordable 4 year university in the state, it isn't realistic to expect a tuition decrease.",

And with the cost of tuition more than doubling in the past decade, why should we feel bad about CSU schools suddenly struggling to pay their bills? If students were expected to come up with the costs, or take on aggressive loans, these colleges can do the same. \n\nUltimately, why the fuck should we pay for a service that we\u2019re not receiving?",

Keeping in mind that once the pandemic is over they will need to start providing these services you're talking about again.\n\nEdit: Also, I agree with you that tuition is far too expensive and continues to go up in price. However, the blame from that doesn't fall on the university, it falls on the State and Federal government who fund the university.\nThe actual cost per student is close to $60,000 per year, Chico is able to charge about $8,000 a year because it is heavily subsidized by the government. The only way to actually lower tuition costs is elect people at the state and federal levels who support free/cheap college.",

But hey, it could start with those couple hundred dollars you mentioned. I\u2019m also thinking about the costs of paying the staff that operates the wrec and general services around campus that are now unnecessary. \n\nBut once again, the university is essentially a business. A customer shouldn\u2019t be required to \u201chelp out\u201d a business just because they\u2019re now struggling with closure/semi-closure. If most/all of our classes are online, why are we expected to pay the costs involved with maintaining a campus that\u2019ll be practically inaccessible to a majority of the student body? \n\nI sympathize with the faculty of chico, there isn\u2019t an easy answer, but the fact that students are expected to pay the exact same price as the previous semester does not make sense when considering the services we\u2019re receiving. \n\nAnd you\u2019re definitely right on tuition. Chico\u2019s tuition is incredibly low compared to colleges around the country, and the determination of tuition isn\u2019t something that this school\u2019s admin is in direct control of.",

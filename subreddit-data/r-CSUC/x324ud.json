Don\u2019t really want to join fraternities, but I thought it\u2019d be cool to meet new people through that kind of setting.",

Back when I was in college you had to know someone in the frat (even if it was just a name, didn\u2019t have to know them personally) or be with a bunch of girls to raise your chances of getting in.",

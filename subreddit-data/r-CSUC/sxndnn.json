    "postText": " I know that some random person on Reddit doesn't know the answer to one specific case of one specific person based on multiple specific factors, but I'm still curious - and desperate. Throughout high school, I have been able to keep my grades mostly in the B to low A range with the exception of math. I knew I shouldn't have taken pre-calculus, but for some reason I did. As a result, I currently have a D- in the class because the teacher is a total dick (the type that assigns literal 100 question homework assignments every night and takes 50% off for two or three wrong questions). I'm going to fail the class, I just know it. This will be the only class I've ever failed, and every other class I have an A in, except AP Lit which I have a B- in but that's a weighted A-. How badly do you guys think this will hurt my admission process? Will I get rescinded over this? Is there any way I can make the class up before the semester starts in the fall?",

            "comment": "Obvious answer: Reach out to an admissions counselor at the university. \n\nAnswer from a disgruntled senior: I doubt your admission will be affected. It\u2019s also possible to take the class at a community college over summer, so ask your school counselor about how to go about that. Otherwise, sure you might have to retake pre calc when you\u2019re here depending on your major, but if you want to go to Chico and you want to graduate you will do both. I hope this helps calm the nerves, but I get that it seems like a big deal right now. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019ll all work itself out :)",

            "comment": "I found myself in a really similar situation as you in 2017. Only difference was that I was getting a D in algebra. Once my grades were finalized that semester and I graduated high school, I was contacted by admissions letting me know that my acceptance was going to get rescinded. Long story short: they told me I just had to write a letter of appeal to the admissions office which would be reviewed by a particular board. In the letter  I basically described why I was still a good fit for the school and leaned on my inspiration to \u201cbreak the glass ceiling\u201d by being the first in my family to graduate college. If you reach out to admissions before they reach out to you, I feel it would really show initiative by showing you are serious about getting into Chico. As a side note: I think my situation was little worse considering Algebra is the base math requirement needed for CSU so hopefully that provides you with some assurance",

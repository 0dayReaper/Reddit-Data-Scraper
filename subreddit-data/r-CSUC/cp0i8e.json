I'm a first generation college student that had dropped out of high school, so while these might be obvious to some they weren't for me and I had no one to mentor me going in.\n\n1. Focus on time management. If you manage your time well then you'll do well. If you manage your time poorly it doesn't matter if you're only enrolled part time - you'll struggle.\n\n2. Related, the weekend doesn't start until *the weekend*, not Thursday or Friday. Just because you don't have classes for the rest of the week doesn't mean you don't have work to do. Knock out as much as you can before the weekend actually starts. You'll never do it (or do it as well) if you leave it until Sunday night.\n\n3. When planning your schedule, think about how you like to work when doing projects or chores around the house. Do you prefer to knock out all your chores in a block of time with few breaks? Then a densely packed, 2-3 day a week schedule might be workable. Do you prefer to space your chores out across multiple days? Then plan for 4-5 days of classes and throw an hour or two break in between.",

They make gourmet food on tour days and then butter pasta and chow mein and stuff the rest of the year\n\nAlso, this isn't High School where one little homework assignment will affect your grade by 0.1% or something - you miss even something small, chances are your grade just went down a good 3 or 4 percent. Do everything, even a half assed job is better than skipping an assignment entirely",

It\u2019s never that bad and if it will be you will absolutely know without a doubt if it will, if you have any doubt on this you probably will be fine. Dining hall food is not the best but don\u2019t waste your money on other food because you will regret not taking full advantage of it while you don\u2019t have it later. There\u2019s a Zen Den in the BMU go there for free massage chairs without any appointment. Best time to go is when classes are in session. Have fun but don\u2019t forget about school haha",

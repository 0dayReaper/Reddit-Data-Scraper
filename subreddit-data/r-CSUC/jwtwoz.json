    "postText": "I'm trying to do some research on some places for next school year 2021-2022. I've seen that some complexes are advertising for pre-leasing for next school year already. I'm looking for a one or two bedroom place, with laundry in unit, and parking you don't have to worry about. Also not directly by the train tracks. If you know of any places like this that you recommend please let me know! We'd like to stay under the 1200 range too. :)",

It\u2019s far from campus and not really a student thing, but I mean I lived in the zoo in a 4 bedroom and it was like 1200 a while ago, even living in rio chico I think I was paying 350-400 for a 4bedroom. \n\nMy only concern is in unit laundry and the parking. You\u2019re looking for a house at this point, just FYI. Or maybe Pine Tree, but I\u2019ve been away for a while so not sure how good Pine Tree is nowadays.",

One bedroom is massive while the other is a small room. One shared bath but the master has a vanity in the room. Nobody is allowed to park in complex and will have their cars towed in less that 2 hours so done need to worry on that front. Also when he mentions the zoo, it\u2019s a large apartment complex called Timber creek apartments. Honestly if you look at all the websites you\u2019ll find something for your needs",

    "postText": "Can anyone share their experience about living at Post on Nord? It seems great over the phone, so far staff is nice and helpful, and they have private bedroom &amp; bathroom. BUT I saw online reviews that warn about living there. Loud people, loud smelly pets, thin walls\u2026 \n\nIt was my first pick until I read those. Either there\u2019s some salty residents or I should look elsewhere. \n\nThanks for any input.",

For example, apparently the pool was always too gross to use. \n\nMy advice is to check Google reviews, and take what people say to heart. Stay away from anything managed by Entwood (like the Urban). It's a corrupt company that exists to milk money from students. Unfortunately, seems like most of these student apartment companies are like this.",

The construction had been running behind schedule, and in their rush to get it open by the fall semester, the build quality suffered.\n\nHad a friend who lived there for a year. A pipe broke in a nearby unit and caused minor flooding, but the maintenance staff didn't do anything for a week. The \"free\" internet they include in your rent is slow as hell and has outages constantly. Fire alarms went off all the time. If one person gets the bacon grease on their stove too hot, BOOM, there goes the entire building, even if it's at 3AM the night before a test.\n\nTheir luxury \"amenities\" are really just cheap gimmicks to justify the fact they're priced a good 200-400 bucks higher than other places in that part of town.",

A lot of the problems could be chalked up to bad roommates which can happen anywhere but as others have said they are super overpriced for the experience. The free coffee is constantly out of coffee and flavors, there is door that is supposed to be locked that has been unlocked for weeks now reducing security, the firepits constantly run  out of fuel, and a few months ago a whole building was without hot water for three weeks and post basically did nothing. Avoid like the plague.",

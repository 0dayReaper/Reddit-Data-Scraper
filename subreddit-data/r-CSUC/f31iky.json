In a mean time, if I get accepted, what is the maximum in student loans I can get at once to leech off of for about 2 years? Enough to cover tuition, rent, bills, and some spending money for emergencies etc.",

You will typically be eligible for loans in that amount minus you expected family contribution and any other scholarships/grants.\n\nIirc, it's like $22k year, something like that.",

Did you fill out the FAFSA?\n\nAlso, the deadline for the wildcat scholarship is this weekend. If you think you will be at Chico State next year fill it out. It requires a letter of reference from someone (that isnt due until the 20th) but the questions are short essays about educational and career goals. A lot of people get scholarships because not many students bother with the application",

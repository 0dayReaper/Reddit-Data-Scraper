Some of my friends at different universities have been doing in person classes this entire time and their schools don't have crazy outbreaks. Then again, most of them of go to private schools with large endowments. With the vaccine in play, I'm sure public school will get on that plan.",

The new building helps a bit with this but it's just one building.\n\nAlso, IMO, I'd rather they be more conservative with how much they have in person for Fall since we ended up having a huge numbers spike in Fall 2020. Less to shut down and move to online if they have to for similar reasons.",

Is it ideal? No. But there's way more factors that go into this decision than people think. \n\nAnd yes, I know I'm going to get a ton of downvotes for this comment, but it needs to be said.",

Staff are who work on class schedules, enrollment, maintaining the website and other tech services, advising, graduation processing, etc. \n\nI understand that it doesn't seem fair to pay the same amount of tuition when you're not physically going to your classes, but the university still has to run and operate, even when the budget gets cut by the state and/or chancellor's office (due to the pandemic or not).",

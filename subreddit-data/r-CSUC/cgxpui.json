Is work-study even worth it? Should I just get a job off campus? I have retail and food service experience.",

I believe the tutoring center is work study. And the dining halls. And I want say associated students recycling is too but not 100%. I got lucky and my friend told me about a computer lab position that was work study. \n\nHope this helps good luck.",

Or you can do it online, I personally am bad at filling out apps so I recommend getting help. If you fill it out yourself don\u2019t include financial aid when they ask how much money you have in your bank account (it doesn\u2019t count!). Not sure if you have to be a resident or citizen to receive it :/",

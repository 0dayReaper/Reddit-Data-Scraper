    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm a student reporter from Sac State and I wrote an investigative piece about webcam policy and the confusion it's created for professors and students. I wanted to share it with other CSU's to see if this is a prevalent issue at all CSU's and compare our experiences. Thank you, and I wish you all luck on your finals. \n\n[https://statehornet.com/2020/12/students-clash-with-professors-violating-sac-state-policy-restricting-webcam-requirements/](https://statehornet.com/2020/12/students-clash-with-professors-violating-sac-state-policy-restricting-webcam-requirements/)",

            "comment": "I mean, maybe the professor could have been more upfront with their webcam requirements in the syllabus but come on, it\u2019s a theatre class. It seems kind of obvious that you\u2019ll have to show your face in my opinion. If there was some issue that legitimately prevented them from enabling their camera I personally feel they should have discussed that with the professor ahead of time and worked out a solution. The classes I\u2019ve been in have ranged from instructors just encouraging their students to enable their webcams if they wish, to classes where I\u2019m the only one that has their webcam on at all. However I\u2019m not taking any classes where I have to do any regular public speaking or performance, although when I do I definitely have my camera on. Also, if I did have a class that did require me to have my webcam on, I might not be a huge fan of the policy but it\u2019s not that big of a deal imo. I don\u2019t know, in this time where in person classes just aren\u2019t practical, I feel like turning your webcam on is the least you can do to make classes not feel a bit more personal (especially in a theater class).\n\nEdit: well written article btw. I appreciate that the animations work well on mobile and I don\u2019t have to scroll through 10 pages of ads",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm wondering if you guys have any recommendations for which laptop/specs I should get for a business - marketing major. I emailed the business advisor and ITSS office, neither of whom helped at all. The wildcat store is full of macs, and I would rather stick with windows, but I can get a mac if I *really* need to. How crazy of a machine do I really need for business? Are more intense programs like photoshop going to be prevalent within my major/option?",

I went w/ accounting &amp; as long my laptop could run excel I was golden. A lot of your projects are going to be PowerPoints followed up with a written report. I brought an Alienware laptop the first 2 years so I could play video games during my boring classes. Then bought a cheap $300 hp laptop to bring w/ me for my harder upper division classes &amp; had no problems.",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t get a Mac . I\u2019m a marketing major, typically use more windows applications as of recently. Most professors also use windows based apps and  will send files and make assignments that are more compatible with windows OS because that\u2019s what they use. So just save yourself the trouble and just get a windows based laptop. I have the Dell Inspiron 5000 and it works great, pretty fast, has lots of storage and runs windows applications just fine. I also purchased my laptop about 4 years ago and it\u2019s running better than most people ik who have macs. Also 99% of businesses use windows based computers so get used to it during school. My future sister in law is a marketing specialist for a real estate company , graduated from Chico state and where she works uses windows based computers. So unless you plan to work for apple , most places after college use windows.\n\nAlso keep in mind you won\u2019t just be taking marketing based courses. Depending what year you\u2019re in (lower division and upper division core) uses lots of windows apps (like excel) or websites that are more compatible when you use windows Os systems , like McGraw hill or Pearson connect I\u2019ve found to run better on my windows based Pc than my friends macs.Chico state itself is starting to migrate to student emails on Outlook and because we\u2019re students we get free Microsoft office apps during the duration of while we\u2019re in school.\n\nBest Buy runs a lot of great deals on laptops i recommend the Dell Inspiron 5000 (you can get it a lot cheaper than what I paid for when it was just released) my boyfriend and I have had ours (we each have our own) for the last 4 ish years and we\u2019ve had no issues.

Unless you\u2019re going to be purchasing an external monitor, I\u2019d say go for the largest notebook you\u2019re willing to carry. -I believe you would also be utilizing PowerPoint as well. \n\nI was using windows and loved fancysquares, but switched back to apple because I need an easy way to transfer files from my iPad and use it as a second screen for zoom.. and to use my iphone  as a camera and mic.",

Class feels challenging? Is the internship really competitive? Any other advice and info would be really helpful. Thanks.",

We have a micro bio club that provides people with great opportunities. Sierra Nevada Brewery is in town, so if you want to go into the beverage industry, there's that. In my experience looking at the department catalog, it seems like there are a lot of really interesting upper-division classes. In general, I love the Bio department here! It's casual while still offering great opportunities. You really get to know your professors which doesn't really happen at a lot of other schools.",

    "postText": "-those who live in university village, how easy(or hard) was it to make friends? How can I meet people in UV? I know its apartment style and different from dorms. This is my main concern. I heard that in order to make friends, you need to engage with a lot of people in the first few weeks or you'll be alone for the semester with no social life\n\n-what are the most popular scenes in chico? Do most people really party and go to clubs/bars or are there other scenes that people gravitate towards? Everyone has been telling me its mostly that\n\n-are there intramural sport programs for basketball or place to play basketball \n\n-since I'll have a lot on my plate, what jobs should I look for that bring in a lot of tips and don't require full time? Maybe its different in my country so I'm just wondering.\n\n-im a psychology major. Any thing to know in regards to the major? Any tips\n\n-since I come from a more traditional household from the middle east, I am really worried about culture shock. I don't want to be alone and I'd be lying if I said I don't want to try partying in the US. Anything I should know in regards to the party and bar/club scene in chico?",

            "comment": "Popular places to to are definitely the bars and around downtown but there's plenty of other options if you're not the partying type. There's a lot of cool clubs you can check out and join, bowling, roller skating, farmers market, park, nice restaurants, and plenty more. A lot of the students are friendly and are easy to get along with. There's a good amount of middle eastern students here as well. A lot of them are computer science or engineering students from my experience.\n\n\nIf you want a job there's a lot of restaurants around town that are always hiring and the school has some kind of job system where you can work for them. I can't remember what it's called.\n\n\nIn my personal opinion a lot of your closest friends come from your major. It's easy to talk to classmates and befriend them compared to other people living in other apartments.",

            "comment": "So the thing about University Village is, it's mostly suites. This means you get a 3 bedroom apartment with 1 kitchen and 2 bathrooms and a living room that you share with 6 people. So, as long as you're sociable it shouldn't be too hard to make friends with your roommates. Also, there tends to be a lot of events that happen in UV, so you can go to those to try and make friends.\n\n(That's how it was before covid anyway. I'm not sure what the roommate situation is like now.)\n\nAs for jobs, you can actually apply to be a desk attendant at UV. It's really nice because you don't have to drive anywhere.",

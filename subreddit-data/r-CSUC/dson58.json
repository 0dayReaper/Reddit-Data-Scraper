Did it go alot smoother the second time around? Or was it just as hard?\n\nE: thanks for the responses. I bit off way more than I ever have this semester and I have only one class I am worried about, but was curious about other people's experiences. Thanks again!",

            "comment": "Also, as an fyi, and someone correct me if I'm wrong, but at chico state, you get 12 redo credits that completely overwrite your previous grade.  You also get a separate pool of 16 credits that average the precious grade with the new one, so it's obviously best to try to get a better failing grade than a 20%, if you can help it.\n\nThe replace units are used first, then the averaged credits get used.\n\nI failed a couple classes as I didnt take them seriously after coming from community college and just cruising by. I had to prioritize the homework and make sure I had to understand what was being taught and utilize the smarter kids in my class for help.\n\nFailing isn't a huge deal as long as it's like a difficult class or a one-off.",

Currently in a graduate program at CSUC so I was able to right the ship - but it took A LOT of extra work.  \n\nTaking the class a second time did get easier.  Especially if you kept attending the original class through to the end.  Keeping your old assignments and exams made the second round easier.   It also helped once you had the professor and knew what they expected and you could manage your time more effectively.",

            "comment": "FYI, post-graduation you can appeal to your college to \"dismiss\" some classes from your GPA.   It won't help you qualify for graduation. This can only be done AFTER.  \n\nI did the \"repeat for forgiveness\" classes but I still had a few bad grades that hung onto my transcripts.  I'd re-done some courses at other schools, units were transferable but being from different colleges the \"repeat for forgiveness\" didn't apply because the courses weren't internal/CSUC.\n\nI spoke to my advisers and was pointed to a hardship Appeal process.  I had to write a letter explaining why the \"dead weight\" courses/grades would negatively impact my ambitions and explain the work I'd done to rectify those past failures. \n\nIt worked.  I got both junior college and Cal State schools to further forgive more F's.  The courses weren't removed... it still shows I failed them, but in the legend it explains those grades have been removed from all GPA calculations.   \n\nIt turns out that it wasn't really necessary because none of the graduate programs I applied to cared about GE courses or cumulative GPA.  However, some programs are highly competitive and taking these steps is reflected in your transcript.  \n\n**TLDR:** *When people review your records they can see the mistakes, but they can also see all the steps taken to clean up those blemishes.  I've been told by administrators they're impressed when they see clear evidence of an applicant overcoming difficulties and diligently working the steps to clean things up.*",

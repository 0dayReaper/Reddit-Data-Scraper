    "postText": "Hey guys, I am wondering on some of the pros and cons of attending CSU Chico and seeing if it's a good fit for me. I got accepted to Chico and currently waiting on other schools for either acceptance or rejection (Cal Poly (both), UC Davis/Riverside, San Jose). Again, just wanted some input on the campus, dorm life, academic/sports, and other information that you guys have.\n\nP.S. I am interested in doing Computer Science",

            "comment": "Chico is a college town through and through so you will get plenty of the typical college experiences here (parties, bar life, etc). It\u2019s easy to make friends here if just put in that effort.  It\u2019s also a relatively small town so it\u2019s easy to commute around which is great for college students. The campus is beautiful as well. I\u2019ve only been a student here so I can\u2019t really compare the quality of education to other places but I mean pretty much all my professors have been great and the classes have been challenging enough to where you feel like you\u2019re learning something without it being to difficult to keep up. Also the tuition is relatively cheap compared to other colleges which is a big plus. I\u2019m not a comp sci major unfortunately so I can\u2019t tell you anything about that.\n\nBut honestly, looking at your list of other colleges that your waiting to hear back from, I would recommend going to Cal Poly if you get in. I\u2019ve heard nothing but great things from them and several people have told me that it\u2019s essentially the same vibe as Chico but pretty much better all around (better academically, it\u2019s on the coast) however it\u2019s definitely more expensive. \n\nGood luck with wherever you decide to go.",

Chico was on the bottom of the list of schools I did get accepted to, but the beauty and vibe of the school and town hooked me on my first visit and I fucking love it here.",

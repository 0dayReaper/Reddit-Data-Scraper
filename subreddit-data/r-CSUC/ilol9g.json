    "postText": "\"Community colleges have no compunction about going to online  instruction. They know exactly what service they provide: an education,  full stop. But public and private colleges and universities, who\u2019ve  yoked themselves to the idea of college as a lifestyle experience, have  no other choice, even when that lifestyle is a COVID accelerant.\"\n\nMy thought reading this paragraph at the end of this article is that Chico State is more like a community college; in that the goal was education, so classes were offered mostly online. But after re-reading it and seeing that the author includes public universities in the 'lifestyle' category, I am reflecting on how this does apply to Chico State. \n\n[https://annehelen.substack.com/p/welcome-the-covid-influencer](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/welcome-the-covid-influencer)\n\nWhat do you all think?",

I've noticed a lot of youngins out of highschool really go after that typical college lifestyle though. To some it's just an extension of a community college, to others it's a big stepping stone in their life to adulthood. If that makes sense",

            "comment": "Chico is a lifestyle college. How much this is true depends on where you came from and your program. \n\nLet us first be honest and say every school wants students because they get that mad mad dosh for the school. To continue our honesty I don't really care about that part because I am using the GI Bill and am over 29 years old. This means I dont really care as much about the financial aspect of things as I literally GET PAID to go to my classes (and get refunded for the fees too!).\n\nThat being said in our CAGD program everything has more or less been about pretending you work there, from the systems and programs we use to the documentation. Because of this almost all of our work is online, this caused there to be very little difference in terms of work expected for our courses.\n\nWhere as other (whole freaking departments) groups had to struggle to figure out blackboard, our groups only had to teach the freshman. Our only real failing in my opinion is relying on zoom instead of twitch and discord but that is beside the point. \n\nThat all being said think about how much people pay for a regular semester. You go to actual class and your there, after you go to the library on campus, then to get food from the dining hall. It goes on and on each day of school. Hell even the holding pattern for parking spots is a part of it all! This adds up to this \"college experience\" and is a big part of why so many people are upset about paying full price for the semester when they may as well have gone to community College this semester anyways! \n\nI agree with that sentiment, aside from the workload the ($4k?) a semester experience freshman are getting could have been accomplished at Butte Community College for about an 8th of the cost AND if they are fresh put of high-school (and from Butte county) they get THEIR FIRST 2 SEMESTERS AT BUTTE FOR FREE.\n\nI am going to Chico because its one of the only places that has a Game Dev course that is an actual public college. I am lucky because I not only get along well with the instructors (some of whom I am older than) but also they actually do great work and have the industry experience I need to know whats actually important in our classes! But again, I dont pay for it,  the GI bill does so i dont really care. As for you lot though I would be PISSED because Butte offers many the same classes, has bog fee waivors to in-state students AND has a transfer agreement so almost all the classes you take there would transfer to CSUC.\n\nThank you for comming to my TedTalk.",

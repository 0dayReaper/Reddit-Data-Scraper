            "comment": "So I have never lived in dorms because I'm from here, and they always used to be more expensive than just renting a room. So previous to the past couple years I would definitely have said live off campus. \n\nHowever rents have risen and there's a lot of new luxury apartments that are pretty pricey...really pricey in some cases. And if I were in undergrad coming from out of the area, but knowing what I know now, I might consider the dorms, especially if I didn't like to cook and could get a meal plan. Well, except that I don't really like people so living in a dorm in that close of quarters with so many people would drive me crazy. \n\nYou have to think about your needs and what will suit them. Are you OK being around a variety of people who may make obnoxious sounds at who knows what time of day and night? Do you prefer to walk, drive, or bike to class? Do you like to cook or not want to? What's your budget and whose paying, yourself or your parents?",

I heard the program was great, but CSUC\u2019s reputation as a party school is giving me red flags. Is there actually a really big party culture in this school and would it be a detriment to my study goals?",

By my standards.\n\nThat said.  Chico is not a commuter school like San Jose State.  Kids move to Chico from all over the state to live there, without mommy &amp; daddy.  Things are going to happen. Parties are going to be held.  It's life.\n\nAs to it being a detriment, that's up to you.  How much self discipline do you have?  That's where the real answer is.",

The parties are optional. \nIf you think your the type of person who can't resist partying and drinking if it's an option, then maybe don't go. The school is right by downtown and Frat row, so it might be easier to access parties than other schools",

You\u2019ll be good, just stick to the music scene, shows, etc. and you\u2019ll find good people who won\u2019t make you feel like you need to party heavy, but don\u2019t be afraid to go to a few get togethers and meet people too. The Rec Arts program isn\u2019t very fratty though, like business or whatever. The party culture, Riley\u2019s, and all that can crossover but that\u2019s up to you. No one will force you to party. If you have any other questions about the program, feel free to DM me.",

If you seek out opportunities, you\u2019ll find them, especially since other students get distracted by a lot of what you\u2019ve already mentioned. If you work hard, it pays off. And then when you\u2019re stressed and need to blow off steam, you\u2019ve got the option to play hard. Get your feet wet with student orgs outside of Greek life (they exist, and there are plenty) and enjoy what it has to offer. The food\u2019s good, the faculty are supportive, and the town is a character of its own.",

I enjoy going to the bars sometimes, but have never been a fan of the big college parties. I think Chico is a great school, and, as others have said, your extracurriculars are what you make of them. If you're not into parties, you'll do fine (or better), and still make plenty of friends. \nAlso, there are a lot of chill hippies here that you can just smoke weed, hike, and/or do art with instead. You've got options.",

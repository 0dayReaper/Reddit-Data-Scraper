Get ready to drop like $100 for the course code too. She\u2019s made her class easier, practice exams are nearly identical to actual exam, gives 80 points extra credit for showing up to every class. The people who do badly in her class are the ones who don\u2019t ask questions or just grab notes from their friends at the end of the week.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for my 1st gold ever, shoutout my parents.",

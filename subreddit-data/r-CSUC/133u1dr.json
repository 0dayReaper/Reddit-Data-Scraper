    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m taking organic chemistry next semester with Jinsong Zhang and I am really worried that she is not a good professor from what I can tell from rate my professor. If one of you guys have taken her before, can you tell me how she really was like? It would be much appreciated. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I took both OCHEM 1 and 2 with Dr. Zhang, and she wrote me a strong LOR that helped me get into medical school. She is a very good professor, but the subject is intense. OCHEM is a difficult subject at every university, with a large proportion of the class failing. At CSUC, it isn't any different. 50% of the class will fail, and those who fail will blame the professor instead of themselves. A majority of people taking these classes will be trying to get into medschool, but they are not willing to put in the effort needed for it. \n\nI regularly overhead people talking about partying all night and not doing the hw/studying. Well, of course they won't pass the exam if they're not studying. Most people can not coast through OCHEM like you can coast through many classes at CSUC. You must buckle down and study the material, review, and test yourself outside of class. Don't miss class, pay attention and take notes in class, visit Dr. Zhang during office hours, and study outside of class. Reviewing with a study group also worked well for me. The only downside to Dr. Zhang is that she has a strong accent, but you get used to it, and this is what you can expect from your graduate level professors.\n\nThese classes act like a bottleneck for STEM graduate schools. If you don't have the dedication to learn this material, then you won't make it in STEM grad school. OCHEM isn't even applicable for medschool. You really don't use it in medicine, but it is still important to understand the topic. These classes will also give you an idea of what to expect for grad level courseload, except much more demanding.\n\nI'm happy to answer any other questions you have.",

You need to understand the theories behind why OCHEM exists, and then you can use this understanding to appreciate the mechanics of OCHEM reactions. \n\nMake a reaction mechanism mastersheet, where every time you learn a new reaction mechanism, draw it out and put arrows showing all the movements of the molecules/electrons. This way, you have one document that you can easily reference. I really recommend using a tablet/PC that you can write on for OCHEM since there is a lot of drawing. \n\nTo better memorize the mechanisms, make flashcards. A lot of the time, you'll be given the reactants and/or products and have to be able to name the mechanism and/or draw out the steps. \"Whiteboarding\" is very helpful for this too, where you just draw the mechanism pathway over and over. Learn it forward and backward. \n\nDr. Zhang has required textbook hw. These answers are on websites like Chegg, but do them yourself bc they closely resemble what you'll see on exams. Use the required hw problems as practice with the material. \n\nMake sure to visit Dr. Zhang during office hours, both to ask her questions and build a professional relationship. I assume your goal is grad school, so this relationship is very important. You'd be surprised about the number of people that slack on this and then can't get a good LOR.\n\nIf you do all this, you'll be set to get an A in both OCHEM 1 and 2. I actually enjoyed the class greatly, and it's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's only really hard if you slack off and drown in the material like most people do.",

The walk is totally doable, there were still some parties, and as a bonus, only the building with the fire alarm going off has to evacuate. In the other dorms, no matter who sets off the alarm, everyone has to get out. I think my freshman year it happened close to 50 times in Whitney, at all hours of the day. Trade off is Whitney is the party dorm, but i think parties are gonna be heavily cracked down on anyways due to COVID. Only two people allowed in a room at a time anyways",

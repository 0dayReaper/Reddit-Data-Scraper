I believe we're required to meet with a CS counselor once a semester to make sure we sign up for the right classes.    \n\n\nAs for actually getting in, it's not very tough, but to my understanding there are certain classes which are only available in Spring or Fall, so if you fall out of schedule in some way, it could get hairy.    \n\n\nHave you talked to the chair of the CS dept yet?  He's super approachable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe discord is also pretty active with students and faculty.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres an invite: https://discord.gg/Ufy55nhj",

Talking to people in industry, we are a very hands on learning school which is very nice. And as for registration, there is mandatory advising once a year I think? You basically build your schedule (there's a smart planner to help), show you'll complete all your requirements with your current path, and your advisor checks you off.",

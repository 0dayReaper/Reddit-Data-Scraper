    "postText": "I am committed to Chico for the Fall 2022 semester. I am still finished high school currently. Some of us are visiting Chico next week for a tour, and we are staying over night in a hotel. Is there anywhere that you would suggest visiting Chico? What are your favorite places to visit (besides bars bc I\u2019m still not 21), favorite places to meet people, etc? Also, (unrelated) how successful do you think I could be in meeting new people in that short amount of time?",

If you\u2019re looking for breakfast / brunch, Mom\u2019s is right across the street. Both are delicious and very much loved by the Chico community.  Ngl if you\u2019re only here for a day or two idk how successful you\u2019ll be in meeting people but you could absolutely prove me wrong! People here are very outgoing and social and honestly if you ask anyone who looks like a student or a staff member on campus a question they\u2019ll probably do their best to help you.  Have fun on your tour!",

Chico is pretty friendly, so you could stop a stranger and ask for suggestions and most people will try and help. \n\nIf you're here on a Friday or weekend, there will be far fewer people. I also suggest the bear, but downtown has a lot of places. \n\nIf you're touring then I assume they'll show you campus. So I'd recommend looking at some of the dorms at the north side (by Legion Ave). Just so you know what's up with those. Then I'd also suggest walking around the CHICO streets. The main streets are Chestnut, Hazel, Ivy, Cherry, and Orange. (They spell out CHICO). A lot of students live around that area, so you're likely to be near those streets a bunch when you live here. \n\nAlso Salem and Main will have some stores downtown, so take a walk up and down to see what's there. Unfortunately, the science building and the park attached to it are under construction and the downtown plaza is fenced up right now, so it won't look as nice as it normally would. \n\nIf you have a car, you might want to visit 1 mile or upper Bidwell park. 1 mile can be walked to from campus, but it's a little bit of a hike. Bidwell park is not within walking distance of campus. These are the larger state parks. Very nature focused and lots of hiking options. There's a golf course and trails and swimming spots in upper park. Lower park has a play area and a swimming spot (that's actually the river they dammed up for a pool).",

For example, if you\u2019re committed to the college of ECC you can PM me and I can point you towards groups like our 3d printing club or automotive engineering teams, every student on campus would LOVE to talk about groups they\u2019re affiliated with and share their interests with you. I think most clubs and groups can be found through the associated students section of the website. \n\nAs for where to visit, lower Bidwell park is about a mile from campus, you can also check out upper Bidwell park a bit. Beyond horseshoe lake there\u2019s lots of hiking and some swimming depending on the season.",

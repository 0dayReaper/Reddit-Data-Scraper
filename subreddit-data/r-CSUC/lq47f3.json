I understand some people prefer online but just me personally I can hardly learn anything and am struggling to keep my gpa from dropping more",

Tuition should have been and should be lower for the complete lack of quality education and inability to use resources. Almost $400 per unit in online education is a joke.",

They also loaned laptops to students to ease the transition to online learning. \n\nI understand that you're frustrated, but the university still has to run and your tuition is for the running costs. Faculty and staff (advisors, financial aid &amp; scholarships, the registrar, the library, your department offices, ITSS, etc.) all have to still run to support learning in any form. And it can't run fully in-person because the classrooms are largely too small to accommodate health and safety guidelines. \n\nYou may not be getting the in-person, college experience like you see on TV or in movies, but faculty and staff continue to work their butts off to make the distance learning experience as best as they possibly can. For every class to be completely reworked for online learning was a gigantic feat, and to say there's a \"complete lack of quality education\" is a slap in the face to everyone who worked hard to provide the best they could with all they were given. \n\nI get this is an unpopular opinion so I'm expecting the downvotes, but your tuition doesn't just line the pockets of the administration. Lowering it would mean taking it out of the pockets of faculty and staff, and discontinuing services that you don't realize you do still rely on, even during distance learning.",

There is also the problem that just because SOME faculty actually tried and works their butts off to make online learning work, doesn't mean they actually achieved it or that people are actually learning anything that they payed for. Not to mention the faculty that hardly tried at all. Asking for the same amount of funds to provide a not so great education by professors that were forced to switch over so the education is hit or miss doesn't make sense.",

I'm just trying to be mindful of the people who have literally worked all year to keep the students and university afloat during distance learning. Because they're the ones who will suffer for a tuition cut. \n\nAnd it's not just SOME faculty (which, honestly, is most faculty if you wanna be technical). It's ALL staff, too. They're the ones who made sure classes were scheduled, special department programs were still running, advising and admissions was happening, degrees were being awarded, and all the other admin stuff that has to get done behind the scenes that students don't see or think of.",

Maybe you're not using the gym, but people still use virtual library services, subscriptions that the university holds through the library and ITSS, ITSS services and things serviced by ITSS, you still need advising, degrees need to be processed and conferred, financial aid is being processed and doled out, department-specific programs are being ran, etc. \n\nJust because you as an individual aren't using something (or think you aren't using something), doesn't mean the majority isn't.",

So my advice would be to do two days a week despite it being a long day and then do homework from home or work on the off days.  I would also highly suggest getting a dash camera because I was in an accident that would have been beneficial if I had video footage. I also got a friend to commute with me and carpool for 1 semester but I know this can be hard to do. Also, get the parking pass because it will be worth it in the long run as I tried to pay in the parking areas and ended up paying more than I had bought the pass.",

And give yourself a good buffer so if there's a bit of traffic, or trouble finding parking, you aren't boned or unduly stressed because of it. Also, don't get $20 worth of Taco Bell on your way out of town every night because you'll gain weight. \n\nMy commute was hella long, but this advice should hold up. I'm no help on parking advice because this was 10+ years ago.",

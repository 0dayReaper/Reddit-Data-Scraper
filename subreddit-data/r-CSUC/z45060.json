I recommend you check out the First Year Experience Program https://www.csuchico.edu/fye/\nAlso, once you start your first semester, follow the Chico State Instagram page to learn about the events happening or about clubs. Other good instagrams to follow are Adelante Chico State, the Hub, and Chico State Student Life. \nIt can be overwhelming, but trust me, you'll do great!\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any specific questions. I am currently a grad student and I also work on campus :)",

It\u2019s a great way to meet awesome people, make connections, and learn a lot of stuff you can eventually use on your career journey, even if you don\u2019t go into a music-related field.",

You could sign up, punch in, do your show and bounce, but if you get into events, committees, cohosting shows, coming up with ideas for the Exec committee you\u2019ll get a lot more out of it.",

Especially in engineering, everyone here seems to understand it's a difficult major.",

Really high quality teachers from UC\u2019s and Ivy Leagues even come to teach here because they like working with our population. There are a ton of research opportunities, plus our building is brand new so it\u2019s super nice",

The location means you have access to amazing geologic sites, so you will be able to do a lot of field work. The class sizes are smaller so it\u2019s easy to get to know your professors and they will guarantee you a job. A friend of mine is graduating this year and has a job lined up to do GIS mapping for pg&amp;e. Most of the department also doesn\u2019t believe in the oil industry part of geology so you won\u2019t be restricted to ethically questionable work. I\u2019m taking an invertebrate paleontology class this semester and we have a trip planned to a new dig site in Nevada, never been studied before so our class will be the first. I\u2019m not a geology major but the ERTH courses I have taken have made me want to double major. So yeah, if you\u2019re interested in geology, I highly recommend choosing Chico",

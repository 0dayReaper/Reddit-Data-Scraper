    "postText": "Hi so it's really really early for me to be worrying about this (I am a rising high school senior) but I am very interested in CSU Chico and I want to make sure my path is secure. I am interested in double majoring with the Musical Theatre BFA and the Music Education BA at Chico. Has anyone done this before? It's technically doable, but is it plausible? Would I be able to participate in ensembles and productions without wanting to die? If I take classes over the summer, could I graduate in four years?",

Just always a good question to ask yourself and others - go for it if it feels right! *obviously $ being a factor as well..\n\nI also was in the 4yr track mindset going in, then ended up changing majors 5 times, including transferring universities into another state! Let the good times roll, enjoy the ride, don't try and force an outcome! Always good to have a general direction though, helps keep things flowin.",

            "comment": "I would avoid all AP classes your senior year and take 11 units each semester at a CC to get as much GE out of the way as possible. High school students (k-12 actually) can take up to 11 units at a CC for like $40. It\u2019s probably too late now, but high school students in the Chico area can also take 2 classes each semester (in grades 11 &amp; 12) for $100. \n\nYou only have to take 4 classes to be considered a full time high school student so you could take easy high school classes and some CC classes online and it is manageable. \n\nYou could probably even take speech or another GE over Wintercession to get another class out of the way. \n\nAnd the grades you get will transfer to your CSU GPA so if you get all As it\u2019s a nice boost",

The tuition is almost nothing, the cost of a textbook might be as much as the AP test but you are guaranteed credit, and the class is only one semester. They are 100x easier and the online classes can make it even less time consuming. \n\nIf you are in Chico or nearby, check out their high school scholars program. It is probably too late for fall semester because you have to go to an orientation in May (usually) and turn in an application that is probably due this Friday. But being able to take 2 classes for $100 is a killer deal and you could even do something in your major.",

I was burnt out, stretched thin, and really exhausted by the end of it. It made me a hard worker, but I could have never finished it in 4 years. Although, your two majors are very similar and most likely share a lot of pre-recs and coursework, so it could be possible with a good plan, but expect several semesters of 6-7 classes in order to fit everything in that time period.",

There were one or two semesters where I \u201ctook it easy\u201d and slimmed down to 18 units.\n\nIt will put a lot of stress on you and you will feel like that you have no time on your hands compared to your peers taking 15 units.\n\nI\u2019m definitely glad I graduated with two degrees but it was more work than I initially thought. If you want my two cents I would recommend going for five or six years. If you try and cram it all in four years then you will lose out on the fun college experience that you\u2019re supposed to have.",

If your program is anything like mine, there will be a lot of overlap. I had 45 units of overlap personally. Definitely get ahead with Ap/ community college courses. I came in with 15 transfer units and I\u2019ll have to stay an extra semester to finish both majors. Don\u2019t let the other people get you down. It\u2019s never to early to think about your future :)",

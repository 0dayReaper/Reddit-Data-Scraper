We traveled to New Mexico to launch it at an international competition. The engineering department has some of the best clubs in the school. Most of my old friends in rocketry went on to work in aerospace. There are great opportunities to be had in the department's clubs. Baja is pretty sick too.",

            "comment": "I did mechanical.  Not mechatronic.  Many of my friends were mechatronic so I'm aware of their classes.  A few aspects are world-class opportunities.  Repanich is a really great instructor and he teaches the crown jewel of the program, at least in my view, which is the automation class (MECA 4-something?).  He also helped put together the intro-level course which is also really good, but could have been better organized.  He seems to help with the senior-project class which is another great part of the MMEM program.  You get to build a project for a real life sponsor.  I would also say the classes that are brought into the mechatronics degree from other departments like the circuits courses, circuit design, and programming, are all good choices and great skills to add to your repertoire.  The short comings are that you'll be exchanging this knowledge for that found in the fluids and thermodynamics classes of mechanical engineering.  Frankly, if you want more of a programming and automation background, I think you can make up for it later in your career.  There's also a few classes that are amazing on paper, but poorly taught.  One, at least when I went there, was Instrumentation and Measurement.  In theory it was a great class.  You get to do a lab where you rig up testing apparatuses and program Labview to interpret the data.  But the instructor at the time (Dr A) was dreadfully boring.  If I know my history, Dr Varamahurti started the program but I personally believe he is the least knowledgeable and competent instructor in the department.  I'd avoid him as best as possible but he teaches many classes in the mechatronics department.  If I could do it all over again, I'd probably choose computer science, but mechatronics is a close second.  I just found the thermofluids classes so damn interesting.  But at least right now in our job market, people with mechatronics skills are commanding high salaries.",

            "comment": "I graduated mechatronics last December after transferring from a community college. Really my biggest complaint was that I didn't like the welding setups they had here. I really enjoyed a lot of the hands on classes that were offered and I loved the capstone class (it is a two semester class where you design and build a real world machine for an actual company that contracts thru the school. My team made an automated welding system for Raypak which was awesome). \n\nSemesters aren't too expensive unlike Berkeley (next best school I know for Mechatronics) and the city itself is pretty nice unless you have allergies (spring will suck for you then). It's not nearly as much of a party school as it used to be so if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. \n\nBut yeah, all told it's a pretty solid school with some fun classes. Only catch is you'll have to take classes with Dr. V at some point and he sucks (unless he quit sometime in the last year).",

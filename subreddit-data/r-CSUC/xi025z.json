    "postText": "i am senior at chico state. my parents dont support me financially and thats fine. I find it very hard to pay bills, books, and other necessities on time. i dont qualify for grants because my parents make too much and my job isnt giving me more than 20 hours. im currently looking for another job to get 20 plus hours and get food stamps. i applied for work study and i dont qualify. i want to apply for additional student loans but i need to pocket the money rather than it going towards fees and chico state. does parent plus loan go towards my bank acc if i already paid this semesters fees with FAFSA or does it go towards the upcoming semester fees?",

I wish Chico State did the same thing. There is this thing called the stafford loan. Call the financial aid office and they can look at your account, depending on how much in loans you have taken out I think they can push forward like up to an extra 5k toward you. I already had my tuition paid and I just had to take this loan out last week because the small amount I was refunded in grants and loans at the beginning of the semester I\u2019ve already used up to pay off credit card debt, rent, bills and textbooks/homework software. I\u2019m an independent student with no family contribution. And I\u2019m in the same boat where I only work about 20-25 hours a week and I needed the extra loan to be able to pay rent for the next few months.\n\nI\u2019m sure if you talk to the financial aid office they can help you get some more aid. And yes it will go to your personal bank account, go on your portal and under the financials tab click \u201cenroll in e refund\u201d and you can\u2019t put in the account info and routing number to your personal bank acct to where you want the money to go",

Most textbooks pdf can be found online for free ( I haven\u2019t purchased a textbook in years). Go to the Wildcat pantry for food. Study at the library to save your AC/electricity bill.",

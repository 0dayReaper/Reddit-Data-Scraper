Are you guys bringing one from home or buying a new one? If you\u2019re buying a new one, what do you guys do with it once the year is over because I live in SoCal and it\u2019s not ideal to take the mattress to Chico or back.",

You're lease will be 12 months. If you move to another place for junior year, time it so you're back in town and can move it to the new place. That, or put all your shit in storage for 3 months for the summer.",

            "comment": "Personally, I brought one from home and was lucky to find an apartment I loved and have lived in for 3 years so I haven't had to move all my stuff. I think a lot of people get a mattress cheap from craigslist or fb marketplace and give it away or throw it out when they move. Many apartment complexes have a designated area near the dumpster during moveout season where mattresses are stacked up to go to the dump.\n\nThat being said, I just upgraded from a full size mattress to a queen and still have my full sitting around to get rid of. If you're interested in a free mattress, I'd be more than happy to do a covid-friendly handoff if you can pick it up! I'll PM you!",

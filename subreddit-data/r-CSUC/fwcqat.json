Any advice from previous years or incoming freshmen who know, is the Honors floor a bore bc everyone is studying? I just have no idea, thought i should ask here.",

            "comment": "I was in North Campus and it was a lot less social than Whitney, Shasta, and Lassen. However, a benefit of the honors floor is you would have a quiet place to study. A question to take into consideration is if you would mind walking a couple of blocks over to campus? Good luck on your decision",

If I were you I\u2019d be more worried about it being too loud to study but there\u2019s quiet study spaces in the building and in other places on campus. And having the honors floor in Whit is new for fall 2020.. it\u2019s been in Sutter the last few years ;) have fun haha",

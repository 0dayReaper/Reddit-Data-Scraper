When I took it, MMA required you to get martial arts padded armor and a jump rope. Yoga required you to get your own yoga mat. MMA is taught by Grand Master Azad, he is a distinguished expert in his field. Really cool and interesting guy if you get to know him. I took Yoga with Rex. He is a master at yoga and super chill.",

I haven't talked to anyone about Hinduism in Chico, but there does seem to be a population of Indian students. I just found the Indian Student Association.

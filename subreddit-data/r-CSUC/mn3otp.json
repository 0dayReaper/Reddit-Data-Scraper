    "postText": "Hello fellow wildcats, \n\nI am a grad student working on my master's project. I'm looking for someone who could help me out with some various tasks to help me cross the finish line this semester. Tasks could include:\n\n\\-generally being a soundboard to help me think through things when I get stuck (NVC skills a plus!)  \n\\-helping edit transcriptions of a podcast   \n\\-assistance with audio editing (Audacity or Adobe Audition skills a plus)  \n\\-assistance with creation of social media materials (Adobe Spark, Premiere Pro, Canva etc skills a plus)  \n\\-help with social media promotion of project\n\nIf you think you could help with any of these things please contact me. Note that I am not looking for someone to actually do any of my actual classwork for me. I just need someone to help me stay on track and to delegate some of the technical (non-creative and non-scholarly) tasks to, basically the social science/humanities equivalent of moving test tubes around. \n\nThis would probably not be more than 5-6 hours a week for the rest of the semester. I will pay at least $15/hour, more depending on skills. We could start with a consultation Zoom meeting followed by a trial period of maybe a week. There is a possibility this could continue past the end of this semester. \n\nPlease DM me with any questions or inquiries, or if interested, provide information about your skills and why you are interested. \n\nThank you!",

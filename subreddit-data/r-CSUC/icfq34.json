    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI've created a tool for California students, now including Chico State:\n\nhttps://gradetier.com/\n\nWith GradeTier, you can see grade distribution information for over 18,000 past Chico State courses. Professor names were substituted for numeric codes. Undergraduate and graduate departments from Fall 2015 - Fall 2019 are included.\n\nThere is no registration required: just choose CSU Chico, select a department (and optionally a course number), and click on the desired course.\n\nIn addition to other sources like RateMyProfessor, I'm hoping the website can serve as an objective piece of information when deciding which courses to take.\n\nLet me know what you think, and contact me if you find any issues - thanks!",

The university made the decision to 'desensitize' instructor information in this format before releasing data. \n\nWhile it requires some detective work to piece together which professors taught which classes, it's better solution than universities that remove instructor information entirely.",

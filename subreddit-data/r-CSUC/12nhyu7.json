Then pursue business admin. \n\nIf you want to do operations and supply chain management, cyber security, management information systems (IT) , or business analytics go for business info systems. One you\u2019re done with core it really just depends what your good at/ interested in",

It\u2019s your work experience and internships that help you get the real life skills you need for a career.\n\nI have an AS degree from a CC then transferred in. I had a 6 month internship as a technical writer with a national brewing company, I have 2 years purchasing and administrative experience, and loads of other experience. It doesn\u2019t matter what school you go to, it matters what you do with your time there.\n\nMy brother in law (biology degree) and sister in law (business- small management) graduated from Chico last year, my aunt (engineering)and uncle (business - marketing) graduated from here 6 years ago. They had no issue finding work after grad. I\u2019m about to graduate With a Business Marketing degree and already had offers.\n\nThe Chico state Alum is also very well known and you will meet wildcats everywhere and will always help a fellow wildcat find work.\n\nAlso, as a note please remember to look back at my parent comment as I have already previously described the job placement ratings for the programs",

The Chico alumni consistently provide a deep thorough understanding of the principles and procedures to construct a building. \n\nPersonally, I could not have been happier with the education and college experience that I received while at Chico. I hope that this helps!!!",

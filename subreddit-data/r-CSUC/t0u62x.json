    "postText": "Good evening to whom it may concern, \n\nI recently got into CSUChico and was wondering if anyone had any information regarding Chico's civil engineering program. How was your experience? Worth the time and money? I also was accepted into Cal Poly Pomona but I'm not sure which one to commit to. Any information helps, thank you!",

            "comment": "Hello! I graduated from Chico State with a civil engineering degree last spring. I thought the professors were knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodating. Particularly the department chair Stephen Mehl, who teaches fluid mechanics. My situation didn't allow me to do any extracurricular activities, but some friends I had seemed to really enjoy being a part of the concrete canoe, geowall, and other such competitive teams. There's a couple teachers who weren't super good, but I expect you'd find some of those anywhere. Is there any specific questions you have?",

            "comment": "Good morning! Thank you for replying. I was wondering how are the engineering fairs for jobs and internships.. if any? Do you feel that Chico truly prepared you for the field? Within the specialities, which one did you pursue?structural, environmental, construction? I\u2019m aiming towards structural. My biggest concern is how the program prepares its students compared to CPP. Based on the tour I had with CPP, I saw a lot of hands on, which is great and all but I also heard Chico offers somewhat the same experience.",

My general experience is that engineering school is to teach you how to problem solve and learn processes, and not necessarily teaching you the most relevant information to be used in whatever job you get once you graduate. I was able to pass my Fundamental Exam while still in school, and took the Professional Exam (which I did not pass, but was close). I took transportation related courses, though I'm now in a construction field. I have no idea about the comparison to CCP. We have a lot of good physical labs which you'll get a ton of time in. I had my last year over Zoom, which wasn't great, but I would assume that won't be a concern going forward.",

            "comment": "I bought an MSI Stealth GS63-8RE in 2018 specifically for my engineering classes before beginning my first semester. I believe it was like $1200-1500 from BestBuy and I bought it because it was one of the only \u201cgaming\u201d laptops that wasn\u2019t super bulky. All of MSI\u2019s \u201cStealth\u201d lineups are meant to be slim, which I like since I\u2019m carrying this thing to class everyday. I\u2019m still using it to this day as I finish up my last semester, and it was worth every penny. Invest in a decent laptop from the beginning and it\u2019ll last you all throughout college and beyond. Importantly, you\u2019re mainly just going to be needing ram and a decent CPU. I feel like the department somewhat overestimates how much power you\u2019ll need for these programs. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people get by with a decent razor laptop or upgraded Lenovo workbooks. Solidworks is probably your most \u201cheavy duty\u201d program you\u2019ll be running, besides that most of the other coding/electrical/simulation softwares are fairly light weight. \n\nLong story short if you don\u2019t want to break the bank, a gaming laptop from a few years ago will do the trick. Or go for the latest and greatest if you want to spend more. As long as it\u2019s windows and is a \u201cgaming\u201d laptop, you\u2019ll be fine. Dm me for any more questions",

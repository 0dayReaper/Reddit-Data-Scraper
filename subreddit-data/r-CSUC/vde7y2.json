Depending on when you graduate and whether or not theres a recession, you might have a job basically handed to you. Dont worry too much. just find a business type you like. If you dont want soul sucking corporate work, dont go down that path. theres a lot of opportunity for a major like yours so work in an industry you can stomach. Something related to sustainability maybe",

The career center wouldn\u2019t even let MBA students host their own career fair. \n\nJobs are out there but you need to put in the leg work. Do research on your industry to find companies and apply on their websites.",

But, you\u2019re definitely guaranteed job placement within 6 months of graduating and sometimes even before graduation (the BSIS department prides themself on this) The BSIS department is also SAP alliance certified and a lot of companies see this as a huge win and there\u2019s not many campuses that can teach SAP and be a certified alliance with SAP!",

I\u2019m currently getting a project management degree from Chico state and that has lots of opportunities with good pay. If you\u2019re concerned about job opportunities go for a PM , HR, Finance/accounting degree in the BADM department or do either management information systems or OSCM through BSIS (just about 100% of student who complete the BSIS degree get job placement within 6 months of graduating- that was my original degree bsis-oscm) . Also while you\u2019re in school try to get as much relevant experience as you can (internships , take a gap year and work etc.) hope this helps!",

    "postText": " \n\nhi,\n\nI'm currently at a community college, and have a deep interest in robotics. I also love biomedical engineering (going at that from a mechanical side ofc), and can't decide what major to go for, here are the options that I got, also I live in cali, and would prefer not to go out of state:\n\n1. Chico state: The Mechatronics program there really interests me, the only thing that does worry me however is the fact that it is not a well-known program. I am trying to get hopefully get my masters in robotics either somewhere in the US, or abroad. I know job opportunities for this field are ok, not as good as Mechanical obv. I was thinking about double majoring Mecha and Mechanical. One other thing that the head of the program there told me is that they dont know if other masters' programs accept mechatronics BS....so this has me stuck.\n2. Mechanical Engineering with specialization in control systems. I have heard that this is a good route that some people take to become an engineer in the bio med field, or to get a masters in robotics. I know a few people that went for this degree said that there is no hands-on activity and barely any software. I really like software AND mechanical systems, so this is not my preferred method of choice, but defiantly doable.\n3. double major, Mehca or Mechanical with computer engineering. This is also an option, but the workload would be extremely heavy since they do not have ANY correlating classes together, but it is still an option.\n4. Mecha or Mechanical degree, with a minor in Robotics Advanced Manufacturing. This one is definately an option, but I really don't know how a minor would effect/help me go abroad or stay in the US to get a masters.\n5. double major in Mecha and Mechanical. This option I have been thinking about for a while, it is a heavy load, but I think it might be my best option here.\n\nI have tried to contact people, but nobody seems to know anything about the questions I have, so this is my last resource. please help. If any engineering students that go to Chico state could message me that would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "The mechatronics program is extremely well known among people in the industry. Job opportunities are not more limited than with mechanical, because there is considerable overlap between majors. Many mechatronics majors end up working as a purely mechanical engineer, and vice versa. Median pay is slightly higher for mechatronics than it is for mechanical. You can definitely get a masters later if you want, but it's not necessary for the job field. Most graduates from mechatronics or mechanical should be able to make six figures within a few years of getting into the field.\n\nI would suggest enrolling in mechatronics and see how you like working with circuits, programming, etc. If they're not to your liking, it should be easy to switch to mechanical. A double major adds something like 2 semesters if I remember right, but the opportunity cost for this is significant. Just stick with one and go for it. You will be very employable no matter what.",

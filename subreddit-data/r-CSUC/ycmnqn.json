    "postText": "Hi, I'm thinking of transferring to Chico next year into the Multicultural and Gender Studies degree. Can anyone tell me what their experience has been like with this major as well as their overall experience here? I am a queer student as well and am wondering if there is a decent LGBT population here? Thanks!",

Chico is more liberal than other areas in the north state. If you want to feel more connected you can always get involved on campus I think Gsec has a club. They put on events every now and then. There are volunteer groups too that you can get involved with. Campus is pretty. The student apartment area is so so. Bidwell park is nice. You can walk in lower park. Go swimming in upper park or hike. Lassen isn\u2019t very far away either if you like hiking. A day drive to Sac or SF. The cost of living is lower compared to other CSUs. There\u2019s always campus tours to get a sense of the town.",

            "comment": "There is a high lack of diversity here at csuc. It\u2019s a great school with great professors but you won\u2019t find a lot of diversity. Chico state is more so known  for their business degree more than anything (that dept also gets the most funding) So I suggest if you\u2019re going for a more liberal arts type of degree I\u2019d suggest going somewhere else. I myself am bisexual and I haven\u2019t met many other people (maybe I\u2019m not trying hard enough to meet people like me) but anyways the school is majority white and Hispanic, and there\u2019s not a big lgbt presence here from what I\u2019ve seen. You have a lot of people from the Bay Area, so cal and nor cal locals. \n\nAlso please consider the area. People in Chico are a bit more open minded than let\u2019s say paradise or Oroville. (The surrounding cities) my partner worked in Oroville and heard a lot of bigotry ranging from homophobia to racism. 94% of butte county is of white ethnicity. Please keep that in mind. I\u2019d suggest going to a bigger school like Sacramento state, San Jose state, or San Francisco state . Those schools are much more likely to have a bigger presence of what you\u2019re looking for and they are located in more diverse areas",

    "postText": "I received the following email in my inbox even though I am not an Accounting Student. What is this all about?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nIn March 2019, the University began an internal investigation into a variety of budgetary, contracting, personnel, and other practices in the College of Business. This investigation uncovered numerous instances of professional and fiscal misconduct in the Department of Accounting dating back to 2014 and resulted in fiscal losses of approximately $1 million.\n\nBased on the evidence, today the University placed four members of the Department of Accounting on leave. Final disciplinary action can only be taken after each of these employees exhausts their appeal rights under collective bargaining agreements, Chancellor\u2019s Office directives, and relevant governmental regulations. In addition, as required, the University has referred these matters to the appropriate investigative authorities and will be seeking appropriate restitution.\n\nBecause employees have privacy rights, we are required to treat these personnel matters as confidential, limiting what we can share. I ask for your cooperation, patience, and continued professionalism as the personnel process takes its course. In order to protect this process, I also humbly ask for your civility, collegiality, and integrity during this period of transition. If you witness or hear rumors and innuendo, I hope you will remind folks that we must allow personnel processes time and space as required by law, and that we owe it to each other, and our students, to be a positive force for their success. All faculty, staff, and student inquiries on this matter should be directed to Mike Thorpe, our campus risk manager, while media inquiries should be directed to Sean Murphy and Stephen Cummins in University Communications.\n\nRegardless of the final resolution of any appeals, this investigation has identified numerous corrective actions that will be implemented throughout the University to strengthen our systems and processes, especially in employment contracts, conflicts of interest and self-dealing, the granting of release time, tenure and promotion, hospitality, travel, and vacation. I won\u2019t sugarcoat this\u2014we have a lot of work to do, but we will get it done.\n\nThe suspended faculty members will not be teaching in the winter session or spring semester. Effective immediately and until further notice, faculty in the Department of Accounting will be supported by Damon Aiken, Chair of the Department of Finance and Marketing, and Laura Bass, the department ASC. I thank Damon and Laura for stepping up to this additional responsibility, and I request your support in helping them lead us through this period of change. Together with our colleagues in the Department of Accounting, I am confident that we will build an accounting program that we will all be proud of.\n\nAs we move forward together as a College of Business, our college leaders must demonstrate leadership in discharging their responsibilities in administration, curriculum management, human resource management, student success and equity, budget, planning, and coordination. As faculty and staff, we should all exemplify a culture of transparency, collegiality, and integrity. As business educators, we know that it\u2019s not enough to proclaim the highest standards of ethics and integrity\u2014we must live by them every day.\n\nI recognize this is a difficult way to end an extraordinarily challenging year. Thank you for your patience and support as we work through this investigation and pending discipline.",

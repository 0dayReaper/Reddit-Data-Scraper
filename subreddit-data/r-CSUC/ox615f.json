    "postText": "this is kinda an extension of a previous post but wanted to ask abt 2 things:\n\n1. How do you guys recommend getting to know people as a transfer student? are classes the best way or should i move into a like 2-4 bedroom apartment at least for the first year to try and make some connections? Only thing is that regardless I miss out on the benefits of the dorms since I cant walk down the hall and have every door be other classmates.\n2. For CS students, how easy would you say finding an internship is either during summer or the school year? Also what year did ppl usually try to find them (I'm intentionally going to chico for 3 years instead of 2 so I'm not in a rush), and how much have ones you've gotten paid?\n\nObviously feel free to just answer any parts from these u can and thanks for the feedback",

For some people it may be easier here in chico, there is lots of contracting and agriculture work. Where as people like me in game development have a hard time because game companies are very picky.",

I transferred last year and moved to University Village (the housing that they place transfer students in, there are other students there too tho) and was going to try to make friends there but COVID shut it all down so I moved back home to my parents. In a normal year at UV, you will have several roommates that you are able to make friends with. I found it really easy to make friends in my classes online because we could see each other\u2019s names and then send an email asking for their contact info since we shared many classes together. If I am going to make more friends this year it will probably be through classes or through the friends I\u2019ve already made since I\u2019m not living at UV. \n\n2 I\u2019m not CS but I attended a zoom \u201copen-house\u201d type of meeting with the career center a year ago when I was doing orientation and they said that they\u2019ll help students find internships.",

    "postText": "Hello! \n\nMy name is Fig, and I am transferring to Chico State for the Fall to pursue my B.A. in Recording Music Arts, and am looking for a potential roommate. I am just starting to look at places to live, but I would like to have this figured out soon. I am a 22yo male, introverted, a bit socially anxious, and like many forms of art, being creative, going to concerts, animals, watching movies, heavy metal, and playing board games. I prefer to house with other creative-minded individuals. I have no tolerance for hate, bad vibes, messiness, any sort of racism, transphobia or homophobia, so if you are into any of that stay away. Please let me know if any of you are also looking for a roommate or might have a place for me at your spot! I would love to talk more with anyone interested, maybe over Discord, zoom, or phone call! Thanks!",

            "comment": "So far, I\u2019ve really done well at chico. There are so many opportunities if you take them. Chico is a lot smaller and the professors are here to teach primarily. I think that attributes to a much better education. The research is great, but not as good as Davis. At chico, you will get research. At David you\u2019ll fight with the top students to get research. It is also a great Financial decision in the fact that we are going into a recession. Personally I think that Chico\u2019s campus is 10x more beautiful. You can\u2019t go wrong here if you put in the effort.",

Thus, internships are a lot more competitive. At Chico, a lot of students are looking to do applied work after undergrad, thus there is less competition for research opportunities. I\u2019ve scored two internships this summer, one of which a professor reached out to me for. I love this school and have had amazing opportunities here, and it is so beautiful. Could not ask for anywhere better.",

Like wake up in your dorm 5 min before your class and still make it on time. Davis, while a great school and more prestigious, is fucking massive. Trying to simply get around there is annoying. Idk anything about UCR.",

            "comment": "I graduated from CSU Chico in 2000. Looking back I had a very good experience. It\u2019s regularly voted as one of the best colleges for the money in the nation. The city is a true college town and while it\u2019s full of life during the year, I\u2019d also recommend sticking around during the summer and enjoying the quieter side of Chico as well. Barbecues and small house parties, tubing down the river, etc. \n\nOne of the things I felt Chico lacked was large sports department. There is something different and special about attending a school with a D1 sports program. I\u2019m not sure how to explain it but I\u2019ve seen it with other universities that I\u2019ve visited. It\u2019s just my opinion and it didn\u2019t detract from my having a great experience. \n\n\nThat being said academically UCD is always going to be considered a more prestigious school and depending on your major it may matter when applying for a masters program. \n\nWhen I attended, Chico had a great career placement program with many of the major companies from Sacramento and the Bay Area regularly visiting and recruiting. \n\nI\u2019ll say one final thing and that is much of your  college experience will depend on you more than the college itself. Be active in extra curricular activities and clubs. Participate in at least one internship while in school. It will pay dividends when it\u2019s time to graduate and get a full time job. \n\nHTH and best of luck.",

Professors are amazing, really friendly, excited about what they teach, and there's a lot of opportunities to get involved. The student's are friendly and *everyone* holds the door open for you on campus. Chico State is a beautiful campus and so is the city itself. Plus it's surrounded on three sides by one National Park and Four National Forests. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

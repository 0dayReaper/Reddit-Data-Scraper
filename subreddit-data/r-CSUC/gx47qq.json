    "postText": "So I just checked my portal for this week, and I was curious to see if enrollment was open despite thinking it was going to tell me that I was ineligible or could not enroll at this time, but no, it appears that the Fall 2020 Shopping Cart is open and I can search classes by Nbr. But I have no idea what I'm doing since I'm a transfer and the orientations for specific majors, where counselors and education guide people are supposed to get us caught up on what we need to do and help us enroll in the classes we need, isn't until July 15th. So now I'm confused, all anxious because I don't want to be left out of classes that I need and if I somehow missed the orientation like a retard because it actually happened sooner and I wasn't paying attention.",

The shopping cart is open for you to see what\u2019s available and add it into your cart so you\u2019re prepared for registering for classes on your orientation date. New students and transfers aren\u2019t able to register until your July orientation. Don\u2019t worry though, open enrollment isn\u2019t until August, so you have priority over open enrollment. So if the classes you want are open now, there\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ll be able to get into them. Don\u2019t panic. By preparing your shopping cart before orientation, you\u2019re way ahead of most incoming students.",

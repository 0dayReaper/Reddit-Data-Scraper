While many have similarities, they each have their own customs you\u2019ll come to learn if you don\u2019t get dropped. \n\nYour grades are up to you. You\u2019re here at Chico State for a reason, so you better keep your grades up and get that degree. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have fun.",

All are and more are valid. It\u2019s really what you\u2019re looking to get out of one. \n2. Have you looked into clubs and organizations?\nFraternities are quite similar to club and orgs. I even venture to say it\u2019s probably the best way to get involved if you\u2019re worried about hazing and grades.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for every fraternity out there. But even in non hazing fraternities, there will always be a process. It\u2019s up to the fraternity on how they push the process to thin out people and be selective. \nDuring rush week, if you\u2019re still thinking of rushing I would encourage you to play the field, visit a variety of fraternities and ask a lot of questions to see if it\u2019s for you.",

            "comment": "Just go talk to the guys when they are tabling during rush week to see if you like the vibe and when they have rush events. You can also look on Instagram to see what times ect the events are but definitely talking to them during tabling increases the chances of them remembering you during rush. Just know pledging isn\u2019t an easy process and is very time consuming, every house is different but you will be put in front of challenges and obstacles to overcome together with your entire pledge class, I guess if you want to call this \u201chazing\u201d everyone has there own rituals EVERYONE in the house went through to get initiated so it is expected you do it aswell. (do not ever ask anyone about what \u201chazing\u201d they have to do, or what \u201chazing\u201d they did. \n\nFreshmen cannot pledge Greek life first semester at chico state unless they are already coming in with college credit, I assume this is to crack down on excessive partying and to establish a positive gpa ect. \n\nWith regard to low GPA, it\u2019s all up to you. Sure you will be busy, but it\u2019s how you dedicate your free time. Are you on a strict schedule? Do you manage time well? Do you have time to study so you are getting good grades in all your classes? It is all up to you and is very possible if you dedicate yourself to the best of your ability. I made honors the semester I pledged my house because I was extremely on the ball every day with school and whatever else I had to do. Don\u2019t think fraternity\u2019s are the typical lazy dudes you see on Instagram and the movies, most are dedicated and care about academics and it is important to them and the chapter potential brothers do the same.\n\nTLDR: just rush",

I think between meeting people in the dorms and not wanting authority after leaving HS I dismissed frats as paying to have friends.\n\nRealistically - you'll end up meeting a bunch of dudes that are cool and will probably form relationships last past college + you'll end up getting laid a lot more.",

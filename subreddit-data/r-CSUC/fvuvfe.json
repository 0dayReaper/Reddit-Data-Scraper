    "postText": "Hi there! I am an incoming freshman for the year 2020 and am trying to decide where to dorm! I am stuck between Whitney (because Im very social) and Sutter (because of the big and nicer dorms). I really would like the dorms in Sutter just because of space, but I also want to be able to party! I would stay in Whitney, but Im not a fan of the beds foot-to-foot as they are pictured on the website. Does anyone know if the beds can be moved side-by-side, or does  anyone has a picture of their dorm?",

Had lots of friends to buy us alcohol lol. But that\u2019s good to hear that the reputation is changing. I\u2019d for sure stay in Sutter. Yes whitneys fun but its honestly just so crazy. You never really get a break from the party, and if you live on a high floor and the fire alarm goes off (which is often) you\u2019ll have to take the stairs alllllll the way back up",

Most on my floor kept our doors open with a doorstop or a trash can and met everyone on week 1 to have friends. We were a very social floor and hung out constantly. I'd highly recommend doing that in any dorm\n\nYes in both dorms you can move the beds around. However in Whitney one wall was closets so you couldn't move your bed over there. I saw people who would loft one bed and keep the other low for privacy. \n\nOne thing that is different from Whitney to Sutter that they may not mention is Whitney has one side of the wing as boys and one side girls. Also have an all girls floor as well. Sutter does each room as boy/girl. To me, I make friends easier with guys and so I highly preferred this. \n\nHope this helps",

Not saying the people in sutter aren't cool, I definatly met some cool people there, but overall nothings ever going on. All my friends who lived in sutter would come over to my dorm building (lassen)  everytime they wanted to drink/party becuase everythings much more relaxed. Whitney has a lot of drawbacks in that the dorms arent very nice, you need to wait for only 2 elevators every day, and they have the most amount of fire alarms. I would recommend lassen/shasta because it was still very social but without all of whitneys downsides. But maybe I just got lucky that year. Regardless thats only my suggestion. I had whitney as my top choice and sutter as my second and I ended up getting lassen which wasn't even on my list so you never know, but it always works out. Good Luck and have fun!",

We had a super fun RA that let us get away with so much shit lol. Less social than Whitney sure but Whitney is a fucking cesspool. I\u2019d much rather live in a cleaner environment. I\u2019d say the social environment was more or less the same in Lassen- I had friends in Lassen and spent a lot of time there. \n\nYour experience is what you make of it my dude. My life wouldnt be anywhere near what it is today if I hadn\u2019t lived in Sutter. Its all about the floor you live on and the effort you make to find good friends.",

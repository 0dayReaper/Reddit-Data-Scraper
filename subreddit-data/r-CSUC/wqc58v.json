She also ghosted all of our mutual friends too. This happened years ago and I still think about it but as time goes on I realized she had a lot of issues and was toxic. It still hurts to have someone you considered a sister ghost you but if someone is capable of doing something like that, then I don\u2019t need them in my life. I\u2019ve also been ghosted on dating apps but I try not take that too personally. I hardly know the guys I talk to on there.",

If you want to get good at something like playing guitar, it could take dozens or even hundreds of hours before you reach a decent level of proficiency.  \n\nOn the other hand, even if you walk up to 100 people and ask them all on a date, you will have only technically \"practiced\" asking people out for about an hour in total.  I understand there's more to take into account, but I still think this helps put things in perspective.",

Yesterday evening, I asked her how her day had been. No response. Then when I woke up this morning, I saw she\u2019d unmatched me. \n\nI think some people just like the validation of being asked out, and once they have that, they\u2019re done with you. But I bet others ghost because they meet someone they feel better suited to and just don\u2019t have the backbone or communication skills to communicate that directly to their other love interests.\n\nUltimately, you\u2019ll never know why someone ghosted you because that\u2019s what makes it ghosting. But try not to take it personally. It reflects poorly on the ghoster, and it doesn\u2019t reflect on you whatsoever. Best thing to do is to keep on keeping on and perhaps even feel some relief that you dodged the bullet of dating someone who is inconsiderate and/or sucks at communicating.",

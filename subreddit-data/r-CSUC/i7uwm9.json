            "comment": "I'm a Comp Sci professor here at Chico State.\n\nOur MS program came back from a hiatus last year because we re-designed the curriculum and created new courses to try to fit what our previous applicants were looking for. The current curriculum is focused on *applied* specializations in Computer Science, with less emphasis on research.\n\nIn recent history, most applicants to our program come from either a different discipline and want to develop in-demand skills, or they have more of a theory-heavy background and want programming skills to get their foot in the door at software companies.\n\nNew courses include:\n* Software Design and Maintenance (I designed and teach that class)\n* Applied Machine Learning\n* Web Technology\n* Algorithms and Computability\n\nThe focus is on building real-world skills that can transfer so you can learn state-of-the-art practices but with enough of the theoretical foundations that you can apply it to new technologies/languages as the field evolves.\n\nIf you're looking to be a researcher, it is probably in your best interest to select a program in a PhD-granting university (assuming you get accepted to one and they offer you funding). Otherwise, our program has a track record of preparing students to get jobs in industry and/or transition from a different discipline to establishing a successful career in the software industry.\n\nI don't check this reddit account often, but if you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to the department via email or phone. We (and especially the department Chair) have a reputation to being transparent and brutally honest. We're not going to try to sell you on our program if it's not what you're looking for. However, we offer a rigorous program that can help you develop skills that are current and in-demand in industry.",

I'm not on reddit very often.\n\nI don't know much about the other schools' programs so I can't really judge. But to be honest, if your real interest is in product management and (business) analytics, a MS in Computer Science might not be what you're looking for... that sounds more like a MBA (for the business expertise) or MS in Business Analytics.\n\nMS in CS tends to be a lot more technical in learning programming, software development, and related specialties.",

Chico Area Punks on instagram/facebook is a good source for alternative show announcements. Liveandnaked or nakeloungechico on ig (they're the same venue) post announcements for shows at the Naked Lounge, a coffeeshop venue downtown. Same with Blackbird, 1078 Gallery, and Ike's Place. Ike's just had a killer one-year anniversary show with my friend's band, Steaksauce Mustache.\n\nThere are also sometimes flyers on/around campus. Definitely reach out and follow any local bands to get music and announcements from the source. Surrogate and Jamm are my two favorite locals right now. Feel free to shoot me a message if you ever have any questions or need someone to go with! Lmao",

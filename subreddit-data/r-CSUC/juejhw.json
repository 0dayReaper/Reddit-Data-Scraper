I\u2019ll tell you, once you start seeing smoke, you\u2019ll want to fuel up your car immediately because gas stations become insane during an evacuation. We also had a few fires this year that, while most of chico didn\u2019t need to evacuate, it definitely smoked the hell out of the town and made us pretty nervous.",

If you go to a crowded party with people you don't know, there's a good chance one of those drunkards has a gun in his pocket.\n\nAbout 2 years ago a student killed themselves by jumping out of the south facing Butte hall stairway.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago a crazy guy who has a youtube channel where he literally documents himself being racist, stalking people and being just generally mentally unstable, walked into the library and asked the staff questions about how fast people can escape the building, where all the escape routes were. This same guy was arrested in 2015 for bring a loaded pistol into a movie theater.\n\nThere's an abandoned nuclear missile silo complex north of town. People used to sneak into it, and many would get injured. Today its been sealed off and lets just say the person who owns the land now will not take it too kindly if you go on his land.\n\nAnd finally, the bike trail near campus that goes along the railroad track is sketchy at night, that it has the nickname \"The rape trail\"",

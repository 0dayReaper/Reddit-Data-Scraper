    "postText": "Can I? I didn\u2019t want to wait an entire year so I applied to a CSU and got admitted, but I plan on transferring schools if I don\u2019t like this one for fall semester. Is it possible? I\u2019m using CalState apply and I want to make sure that it does not interfere  with my current admittance to the university I will be currently attending during the spring semester; for example, I want to make sure that my admittance is not withdrawn due to applying to other universities. The deadline to apply for fall semester is tonight but it got pushed back to Dec 1st because of server issues.",

            "comment": "Are you coming to Chico as a freshmen or a junior transfer? Transferring to a CSU is a lot harder coming from another four year compared to transferring in from a JC. They tend to prioritize JC transfers and freshman applicants higher than students looking to transfer from other four-year schools. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not impossible. But depending on how impacted the program is where you would be headed, that could further complicate things.\n\nSo if, for example, you\u2019re a JC student and you\u2019re all done and ready to transfer but Chico\u2019s more of a safety school than your top choice, maybe wait and apply to your top choice directly out of JC.",

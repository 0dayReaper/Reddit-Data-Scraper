How do I pay something before I even know what I\u2019m paying?? \n\nP. S. I already paid the \u201cintent to enroll fee\u201d is that all that needs to be in by the 28th of July?",

If you don't pay then they just pull you from them like 10 days in I think? I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWorst case call finance tmrw at 530-898-5936. They can explain things better than I ever could.\nAlso welcome.",

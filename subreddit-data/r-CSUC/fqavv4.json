    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I've pretty much narrowed down my college decision to Chico and two other CSU's (Long Beach and Monterey). I was supposed to visit campus last week but that ended up not happening. I'm not really a party goer, but I've seen videos of the campus and I really like it. So, I just have a few questions about the school.\n\nWhat is campus life like? How are the dorms? Which are the best dorms for someone like me? I will be 20 years old and not a party goer. Are there fun things to do outside of campus?\n\nAlso, if I were to go to Chico, it would be as a Media Arts major with an option in production. To everyone that has been in the program, how was your experience? What are the facilities like? What are the professors like?",

Chico is significantly cheaper.  Don't know much about CSUMB but haven't heard much in the way of good things outside of the kinesiology department.  I hear it's VERY small, but this has been from people who left the area/school, I'm sure people who stayed would have better things to say.  \n\n\nChico is definitely a party school but just like any place, there's tons to do if you go looking for it. Clubs, intramurals, sports, and music are all great ways to build a community.  Where are you coming from?",

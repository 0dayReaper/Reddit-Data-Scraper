I know all the schools I\u2019ve looked at have had clear audition days listed as something you need to do to even be considered for the music program.\n\nEdit: I reached out to the program directors and they said that it\u2019s not a requirement to audition to the school itself only to the ensembles you are interested in and the voice studio.",

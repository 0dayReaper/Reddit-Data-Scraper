Grab a drink with them, share your gamertag, agree to hit the gym after class, text to see if they wanna study together, etc. Effort goes a long way",

They used to, and I would be surprised if they didn't still, have like a club fair the first week of each semesters where clubs recruit and have tables and such you can meet people with similar interests that way",

The nice thing about having a place to yourself is that when you\u2019re done socializing, you can be done socializing and go home to be alone and recharge. \n\nThat all being said, finding anyplace to live, let alone your own apartment, might be a very tall order right now. Just be prepared for that.",

Yes, there are nice people that I have small conversations with but I have never hung out with anybody from class outside of the classroom. Im super social but the only friends i can say i hang out with are the people i've met in the dorms or from joining a fraternity.",

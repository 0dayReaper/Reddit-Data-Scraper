But I just read through around 20 emails going back for several years and most emails say something about the cause of death, even if ambiguous such as for \"medical reasons\" or \"natural causes\". There are no emails ever stating that a student committed suicide despite the fact that suicide is the most common cause of death, and that we know that there are students who have committed suicide.",

It\u2019s a tough time for loved ones, and sometimes it\u2019s nice to just not discuss the details or cause of death",

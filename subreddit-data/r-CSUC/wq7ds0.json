If u want to find a roommate to live off campus with there are multiple options. One is through Facebook @ Chico state roommate finder. Idk if that\u2019s the correct name, but type that in the search bar and you will see a page dedicated for roommate searching. Option B is to look at apartments that match you with random roommates.",

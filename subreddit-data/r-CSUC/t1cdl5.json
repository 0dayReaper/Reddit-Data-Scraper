WSL for simple stuff and boot into my Manjaro when I want to go full development mode. I used to prefer Sublime Text as my preferred code editor but I've heard VSCode is even better so slowly migrating to it. They're completely different while you can load IntelliSense plugins and syntax-aware features in VSCode it has nowhere near the features and intelligence of a full IDE. If you want the real answer it's just the scripting support and file structure make's it easier for running a complex system. But for you're main CS Classes 111-311. It really won't make a difference they're self contained projects anyways.\n\nI graduated in like 2017, so I don't use Clion at all anymore, I'm currently in Android Development. I never wanna see C++ again haha. But I use Android Studio and IntellIJ which are made by the same company. It's irreplaceable to me. I use VSCode or Sublime for like scripts (Bash, ZSH, Fish, simple python, ruby, yml/yaml etc). Or If I just need to pop into a file without loading the IDE.",

There's the long-term and established professors like Tyson then there's sometimes just people who only teach a few classes and aren't as serious about it but beyond that I've never had a bad professor there.",

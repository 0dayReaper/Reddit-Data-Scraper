    "postText": "I will be transferring to either Sacramento or Chico State this Spring 2022 semester. I need help deciding which school has the better program. I live between both schools, so they are roughly the same distance away from home. Will it be easier to get internships at Chico or at Sacramento?",

Personally I think the department there is phenomenal and I landed multiple internships and a great job coming out of it (ymmv of course). Though the wider school itself does not hold up as well IMO\n\n https://discord.gg/XPMKk3D4",

I transferred to Chico the next year because I was effected by the fires that year. Although the school (CSUS) is much larger and the facilities and rooms are nice. The learning was not as engaging as the classes I took when I transferred to Chico the next year. Chico State has a very large college town vibe that works if you\u2019re a very social person. But sac state has better amenities with its in city feeling. It\u2019s personal preference on literally if you want to go to a large campus city like Sac and a College town like Chico.",

As another data point, both programs are accredited, which involves a lengthy process every 5-7 years of showing an external standards body that your program is high-quality, evolving, etc. Chico State\u2019s CS program just finished its periodic assessment and came through with flying colors\u2014the program is strong as are its faculty. Morale is high for CS and the campus as a whole right now. All good reasons for being a student right now.",

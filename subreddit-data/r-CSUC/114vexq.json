Personally I feel you can\u2019t go wrong with any on campus dorm, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to meet people and be in that whole party/social atmosphere. No matter what dorm you\u2019re in you\u2019ll basically meet everyone on your floor because they hold occasional floor meetings and you\u2019ll bump into them from time to time. They always have something going on so just be on the lookout for flyers and events! I can\u2019t really speak on the party scene as I\u2019m not a big partier (also being a engineering major). But I hope that helps.",

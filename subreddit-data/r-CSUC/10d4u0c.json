    "postText": "How is Chico State nowadays? I\u2019m hesitant bc california has been having a lot of issues lately on its own and I was told Chico has an admissions problem lately with students not going to the university \n\nIm leaving the military soon and I miss california with all my heart. Ill be 29 so im not trying to party too hard but I do want to have fun at school. But ive been accepted to Oregon State and a few other good schools. I am stuck between whether I should go to Chico or move on to a different state. I am accepted into the business school at chico. \n\nJust looking for some advice on possibly going here and how you guys like it. Thanks!",

The leadership doesn\u2019t tend to make the best decisions in times of crisis (see camp fire\u2026 Covid\u2026 flood\u2026 etc) so admissions started dropping during the pandemic as some classes stayed hybrid or online. I wouldn\u2019t let the attendance rate affect your decision too much, given that Chico is a great low cost option compared to many other comparable programs. \n\nI was in engineering. I didn\u2019t do the crazy party scene either, but I made some great friends and we would all do our own thing which is what a lot of people outside Greek life stick to. It is very social though, and has lots to do outdoors as well if that is something you are looking for.",

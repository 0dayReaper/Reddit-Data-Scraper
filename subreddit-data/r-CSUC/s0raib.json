The UCs are all remote for at least two weeks and a few have announced remote for all of January. Several CSUs have announced remote for the first few weeks and a few aren't going back in person for a month. \n\nChico is making a huge mistake going back in person and it is really rotten if they change their minds and students could have made plans to stay home. Part of the chaos at CalPoly was people showing up and then realizing immediately they were sick. It would have been better to isolate at home. Their families brought them and they were sick while in CalPoly walking around, eating at restaurants, etc.",

They keep saying \"students want to be back in person\" but students don't want to get sick, they don't want plans to change last minute when it could have been avoided and they want to do well in school. \n\nI will never understand why the colleges refuse to make this easy for everyone. They could have insisted teachers develop online learning modules like the ones required for online learning pre-pandemic. They should be encouraging open resource tests, grades should be gone and everything credit/no credit. \n\nPeople don't like remote learning but part of the reason students hate it is everything is pure chaos. We are entering our third year of this and it feels like no progress has been made.",

It will mutate again and we face the next wave during the fall sem. At what point do you think it is okay for us to attend in-person then??",

I need to be able to build network, work on campus job and be a T.A . I am just not ready to go back to 2020 life even after getting vaccines. Omicron is a bad flu at this point. The chances of you getting hospitalized is incredibly low if you are vaccinated.",

I know a guy who did glass blowing and you can't really do that at home.\n\nOn the other hand *school better get that money or else how will Gale fill her wine closet?*",

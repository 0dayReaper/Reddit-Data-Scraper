    "postText": "Is anyone else having issues getting repeatedly bitten by bugs? I\u2019ve had more bug bites since moving into University Village than I ever have in my life. I spoke to someone in maintenance who suggested it was mosquitoes because they\u2019ve \u201conly had one instance of bedbugs\u201d- mosquitoes don\u2019t live under my bed and bite me in my room all night. This is seriously untenable, especially considering how much we\u2019re getting charged to live here.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?",

            "comment": "Remove your sheets and look in the corners and crevices of the mattress. (Use a flashlight) Should have black spots. Check if your sheets have blood spots on them, that\u2019s from them biting you and you rolling over on the bite area. Look for reddish brown marks on the sheets. When looking for reddish brown spots, look closely as some could also be excrement from the bed bugs themselves including blood. TAKE PHOTOS. if you find evidence of bed bugs, you will need to wash your sheets and ALL your clothes in HOT and I mean HOT WATER. My ex used to be a pest control tech and he used to say that used to be a problem frequently at university housing type places and places that shared a lot of communal space (this was in the bay not here in Chico) Take photos and document everything. They will most likely need to come in to the apartment, move everyone out for a few days and pest control will come in with industrial heaters and heat the place up to over 200 degrees to kill all the bugs. (Sometimes it takes one day, sometimes it will take two days of heat) They\u2019ll take your clothes out of drawers and lay them on the bed as well as the bugs like to hide in fabric. Take pics of your bites as well, typically bed bugs bite in a line or in clusters. They\u2019re also itchy and mostly flat , and rarely raised red bumps. Sorry this is happening to you! But also make sure to document everything. When communicating with maintenance, make sure you communicating in writing like email so you can prove they didn\u2019t want to check the place out and told you that you have mosquitoes. This can help prevent them from taking any sort of action claiming that you brought bed bugs on site or that you let the situation get worse. Sorry this is happening! \n\nAlso, buy a bed bug mattress cover! It\u2019s a special type of bed bug cover in which bed bugs can\u2019t get through. You put this on your mattress before your sheets, you won\u2019t be able to tell it\u2019s there. You can find one between $20-50 at Home Depot, bed bath and beyond, Amazon, etc.",

Once I fixed the hole in my screen things seemed to get better.  \n\n\nIf you plan on spending time outside be sure to use a bit of bug spray.",

Get a hot metal spoon or knife. \n\nBoil water and then put the utensil in the hot water. \n\nYou are going to put the hot utensil where the bite is against the skin. Do this for a few seconds and it will stop the inching for 24 hours. \n\nHope this helps everyone with mosquito bites",

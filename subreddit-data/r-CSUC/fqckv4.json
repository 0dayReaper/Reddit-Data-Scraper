I researched already and got some mixed results from different years so I wanted to check now. Those who are in the program now, are you satisfied with how it went or is going or would you have gone elsewhere?",

Community colleges aren't as punishing when you get distracted though.\n\nI did my first three at Butte, last two at Chico State, got an offer to big tech before graduating. YMMV but IMO the staff at Chico State has only gotten better since I went. And Butte's is still good",

My first 2 years I dicked around and really struggled but once I put in the effort I really appreciated the classes and most of the professors. The network of CS alumns is actually pretty solid too.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2016, I had a great experience. It was (and probably still is) one of the smaller majors, so planning your classes out is a little more important. Some of the best teachers/professors I've ever had were in the CS department.  \n\n\nThat said, I did transfer as a Junior. I spent two years at a Junior college taking general eds and flip flopping back and forth between majors (Engineering, Math, Physics). I took a CS class by chance (to fulfill a general ed) the spring I was transferring to Chico, loved that class so much I landed with that major. That backstory for my point; In general, if you aren't sure, I would recommend going to a Junior college first. If you are dead set on CS, then by all means go for it and you can be out of there in 4 years or even take the Bachelors/Masters combined program.",

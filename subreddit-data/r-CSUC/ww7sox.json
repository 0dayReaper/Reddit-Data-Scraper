    "postText": "With NSE, you can study away at another campus in the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, or Canada. There are 180 schools to choose from: https://www.nse.org/exchange/colleges-universities/alpha-location/. The most popular destinations for CSUC students include Hawaii, Alaska, New York, Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nNSE is affordable. CSUC students continue to pay their regular tuition while on exchange OR they qualify for in-state tuition at their host campus. Most financial aid applies.\n\nAnd NSE credits transfer back easily to keep you on track to graduate. Speak to your advisor but most students can make it work.\n\nNSE is accepting applications for spring 2023, summer 2023, and/or fall 2023. Start your application anytime: https://www.nse.org/exchange/apply/.\n\nComment below with questions, send me a DM, or send an email to your NSE coordinator at kchavez6@csuchico.edu.",

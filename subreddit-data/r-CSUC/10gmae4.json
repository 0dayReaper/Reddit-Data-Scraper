    "postText": "Hi guys\nI applied to Chico\u2019s MIS program for fall 2023 and i\u2019m crossing my fingers i get in. I\u2019ve really enjoyed all my business class so far but have not gotten to dive into any computer or coding classes yet. My career goals atm web or program development, but I\u2019ve heard conflicting things about going to school for this. I guess my question to anyone currently in or graduated from the MIS program at CSUC is was it worth it? what were you able to do after graduation or while in the program? thought on the program overall? Any feedback is appreciated(:",

MINS is in the Business school and accordingly, it is more business-oriented -- with more concentration on Databases and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.\n\nBoth CSCI and CINS require core object-oriented programming classes before getting into upper-division classes like Web and Mobile development.\n\n\\- signed, a comp sci professor who teaches software engineering",

CINS major automatically includes classes in the Business Administration minor.\n\nA nice convenience is that the core classes in CSCI and CINS overlap (i.e. CSCI 111, 211, 311) so while you're going through those classes, you can make progress in either major while also deciding if you're more interested in the math/scientific aspects (CSCI) or business aspects (CINS) of the tech world.",

I have built my technical skills over the last 5 years but was able to fast track my career because I also understood the business side which I partially attribute to my MIS/BIS degree and business background as opposed to being a purely technical developer right out of college which may be more associated with a CS degree. I will say the program at least when I went was a little too SAP heavy but that may be just because SAP roles are not interesting to me.  This degree is more focused on databases, SQL, ERP, etc. none of which really align with web development. Let me know if you have any questions or what a possible career path looks like for this degree. I would say it was definitely worth it for me and where it's led me in my career.",

Now I'm at almost 200k in total compensation to give perspective in terms of career/comp growth. I was able to find my first job at the career fair while I was still a student. Right now the tech industry is pulling back hard so I imagine job prospects for a new grad are tougher to come by unfortunately.",

            "comment": "I majored in MINS at Chico (class of 2018). I got a job at a large tech company in the Bay Area right after graduation and have been there for almost 5 years now. I work in IT, so not all of my MINS learning was relevant, but some classes (e.g. the Project Management ones, Networking, and SQL classes) were very helpful. I've been promoted to a senior level role and get paid well. \n\nMINS is a pretty sought after degree and has a lot of different pathways you could go into (Supply Chain, Database Admin, IT/Networking, Project Management, etc.). If you are only interested in web development, then I would maybe consider CSCI or CINS, but if you want to learn the business side of things (very useful if you want to be promoted to a management role at some point) in addition to some technical aspects, then MINS is great. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions or want to discuss anything about the program in more detail, I'm happy to help!",

Was wondering if anyone here has/knows/is in the program and is willing to answer a few questions?\n\nI can't find much info about it and would love first hand experiences. \n\nThanks!",

It is to my understanding that it is supposed to be an inbetween of mecha and sustainable manufacturing. \nYour probably not going to get much info on it give how new it is, but it should share a several classes with the mech, mecha, and sm courses.",

A lot of the classes have some form of hands-on aspect with key highlights being smfg 160 (full metal shop class where you have to make a hand winch from scratch) and senior capstone (easily one of the best parts of the program)\n\nChico has a lot of contacts through professors and job fairs. A decent majority are agriculture related but several other fields also recruit there. Not sure on the exact prospects (got lucky with a company i interned for wanting me back).\n\nI spent 6 years getting my BS (wild fire, covid, family health, bad time management, and a crafty physics department) and unless I get paid to earn my MS, no, I will not.",

Seems like Meca requires most of the traditional engineering classes Calc, Physics, Statics, Dynamic, etc... Vs AMAR which surprisingly only requires pre calc, general physics,etc for lower divs. \n\nIn your own personal thoughts on job prospects of MECA vs AMAR?",

                            "comment": "Both are a little tricky to answer that question. Mecha is relatively new (I think the number of universities that offer it are in the single digits still) and AMAR is brand new. You would need to explain a bit about the degree (I just tell people mecha = robotics at this point because of all the questions) to most employers. I have yet to see a job specifically call for a mecha, but in most cases an engineer is an engineer just some a chocolate flavored and some are banana flavored.\nI would say to look into mecha if you like more design work and unique, one off, projects and AMAR if you are looking more at industrial applications. Either one though will probably always be in demand given the steady increase in robotic platforms and the need to design and maintain them.",

It\u2019s focus is on practical application of manufacturing technology and robotics, but isn\u2019t an \u201cengineering\u201d degree per se. It does however offer some of the business and communication aspects of the engineering/manufacturing industry that engineers tend to miss out on. \n\nMECA is an ABET accredited engineering degree that is a split between basic EE concepts and ME concepts. So instead of thermodynamics you\u2019ll know electronics. \n\nFor job prospects, the jury is still out on AMAR but the previous SMFG major was very applicable and I\u2019ve seen alumni go on to work at major companies in traditional engineering roles with it, and I\u2019ve seen others in more business/project management roles with that degree. MECA is about the same as any other engineering degree, and you can take technical electives to tailor it to what you want to do post college. \n\nSource: MECA alumni",

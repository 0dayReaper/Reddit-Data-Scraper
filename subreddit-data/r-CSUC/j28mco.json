    "postText": "They look almost identical based on the course description. Can anyone who took the class tell me what exactly the difference between these two classes are? I took the 211 equivalent at a cc with java and did all of what 311 says it's going to cover.\n\nedit: our 211 equivalent looks at binary search trees, merge sorts, heaps, and graph theory algorithms like bfs and dfs",

This class basically drilled into me basic c++ memory management techniques. \n\n311 gets real heavy into algorithms. Sorting, hash tables, trees, graphs etc... . 311 when I took it was hard enough, if your new to C++ I would retake 211.",

            "comment": "Sorry for the late comment, as others have said 311 is pretty heavy into more advanced sorting algorithms and graph theory and memory management type stuff. It\u2019s pretty much a continuation of 211 but in my experience it\u2019s significantly harder (I had to retake it), it\u2019s pretty much a weed-out class for CS.\n\nI\u2019d like to add, I don\u2019t know if she still teaches it but I would recommend... not taking it with challinger. ~~I think they have Todd teaching it now as well and I would highly recommend getting into one of his classes if you can.~~\n\nNext semester is being taught by Elena and Tillquist ( http://ems.csuchico.edu/APSS/schedule/spr2021/CSCI.shtml ). I\u2019ve never taken a class with Tillquist before so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s like, but Elena is an excellent professor. You\u2019ll definitely learn **or else** in her classes, it can be pretty intense, people tend to either love or hate her classes.",

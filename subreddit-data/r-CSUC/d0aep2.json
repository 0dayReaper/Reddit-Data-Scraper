    "postText": "So I'm on my last semester at chico, I only need 2 courses (6 units) to graduate. I figured, it being my last semester, I'd take on extra classes that were low level and just kinda fun since I can use financial aid and whatnot. So I had 12 units, but had to drop backpacking as the trip was the same weekend I'm going to oktoberfest, which I've never gone too and already bought tickets and the trip is kinda the point of the backpacking course. \n\nSo now I'm down to 10 (3, 3 unit courses and a 1 unit course) and the only option I've found even remotely interesting is canoeing. Are there any others anyone has taken? Or would anyone recommend canoeing? \n\nMy other options are: drop to 6 units. Drop the 1 unit, pickup a 3 unit. Pickup backpacking and drop oktoberfest. pickup another 2 unit that fits my schedule (that I like)",

I understand it\u2019s a business and that he also does quite a bit of good in the community, but he\u2019s got some slimy business practices. Like he requires students to buy gear and equipment from him for martial arts classes at CSUC, even if you have your own. He also teaches bad technique, and then discourages his students from sparring. My guess is because he knows they haven\u2019t learned proper technique. And he also calls himself grandmaster, which is a big no-no in the martial arts world.",

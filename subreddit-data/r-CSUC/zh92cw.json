    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to know if anyone has any insight on the mechatronics engineering program at CSU Chico. I got accepted to attend as a Fall 2023 transfer. I wanted to know the word from students or Chico State graduates. I live around five hours away. Were any mechatronic grads able to get jobs as Robotics engineers? How are the internship opportunities? I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the program.\n\nThank you.",

(I\u2019m a current business student here) She loved the program and said there\u2019s many great professors, she got offered a 65k+ starting salary new grad job offer for a component manufacturing company in the Sacramento area as soon as she graduated . She then moved in to quality assurance and within 3-4 years working for her company she makes over 100k a year. (Then again she started many years ago when salaries and cost of living weren\u2019t as high as they are now and also depends the area you want to move to or work in) Def worth it. Also look on to Chico states advanced manufacturing and applied robotics degree within the engineering dept and see if that peaks your interest instead!",

            "comment": "Its a good program, you will be very experienced and ready for the workforce. As far as getting a good internship/job it all depends on you applying yourself. You're not just going to get internship opportunities without putting in any work. I've seen MECA's go on to work for Lockheed Martin, Tesla, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, etc. But these people were very outgoing and actually were putting in the effort. Getting a degree is just one part of the equation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes for pretty much any degree at any Cal University. I believe you can get a good job no matter where you studied as long as you're passionate. A degree from Chico doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a job over someone who studied elsewhere. Companies are looking for experience and knowledge, not nitpicking your university.",

I got a job as a manufacturing engineer (I also minored in manufacturing) but it\u2019s a very hands on/application heavy program. \n\nResearch/internships are definitely available, you just have to really be interested and go the extra length to to seek it out from professors. \n\nFurthermore, the faculty really care about your education and the extracurricular programs and competition teams like Formula SAE are great additions to the in class work. I believe there are some robotics focused teams now as well.",

If you like programming and making motors move, mecha is more in line with that.  Capable minds can cross over easily regardless of which one you pick.",

At my current community college, I\u2019ve been advised by all of my professors to choose chico because it has a good reputation based off of alumni success stories. Would you say this is true? What stands out about the CM program at CSUC? Any general information about the cm program at the school would be helpful.",

Best of all, they all bring food from resturants around town! I barely had to do any grocery shopping lol. But if you try, you dont even have to try hard, just go and interview with companies you will get an intership. By the end of the school year every CM major had an intership. Theres also PLENTY of scholarship opprotunities and awesome clubs if you want to specialize in a certain industry.\n\nWhen it comes to job, just about everyone in my class had a job lined up before the 1st semester was over. Im in the bay now and just about everyone i work with (that majored in CM not civil engineering) are either from Chico or Cal Poly. They seem to be the 2 biggest CM schools in California. If you move to a metropolis like the bay or LA after school, you should be making around $80k.\n\nThe classes themselves were great too. I felt CM had a great culture where everyone wanted everyone to succeed. We would all go out of our way to help each other with homework or studying.",

It\u2019s actually quite ironic because as I\u2019m replying to your message I\u2019m at a regional competition with both cpp and csuc at a construction competition. I\u2019d say they both have pretty high reputations. Honestly though, I\u2019d say I hear better things from csuc though overall. For CM though I know that chico is really high regarded. Might as well go to chico because I think they have a lot of alumni that were construction majors.",

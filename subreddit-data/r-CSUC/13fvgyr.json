Is it likely that I\u2019ll get off the waitlist and be able to get a dorm? I\u2019m coming from socal, so commuting isn\u2019t on option. Any help or advice would help, thanks :D",

But for some dorms like the off campus UV I think you pay quarterly (I have a friend who lives there and he said it\u2019s paid quarterly at least for him) . But any regular apartment you\u2019d pay monthly. And tbh when you break it all down you\u2019d actually pay LESS living in a 2-3 bed apartment with one or two roommates than you would sharing a dorm room and not being allowed to have certain items and not being allowed to make your own meals. Because when you live in a dorm or in off campus dorms you need to most of the time pay for a meal card through the university. As a college student depending on your income you can qualify for cal fresh and get $250 a month for groceries for yourself. You\u2019ll also get discounts on internet and electricity.\n\nI transferred in and will always recommend an apartment over a dorm. You have more freedom to do what you want and you can choose your own roommates. (My sister in law also lived in one of the dorms on campus for a year a few years ago and hated her roommate and wasn\u2019t allowed to do anything ) . Living off campus also gives allows you to learn more independence",

Look in to the following websites: \n\nhttps://www.hill-properties.com/listings\n\n(Hill properties is also Chico college living) \n\nhttps://www.csuliving.com\n\nhttp://www.blueoakchico.com/rentals.php\n\nRemember to start trying to secure housing asap! Find roommates first then apply for apartments because all of you (if you choose to have roommate\u2019s ) will need to fill out applications and have credit checks and income verification. You will most likely however need a cosigner regardless if you live by yourself or have roommates because you\u2019re also very young I\u2019m assuming just barely 18 with no credit history or long income history . When my Fianc\u00e9 and I moved up here two years ago his mom signed for our first apartment and our current one since we didn\u2019t reach the credit score needed , but we did reach the income level. \n\nWish you best of luck! (:\n\nEdit: I think Chico state has a roommate finder or there are roommate finder apps that you can set your location to chico. Also try and see if there\u2019s a Facebook page for your graduating year and you can post there",

    "postText": "Does anyone have any advice for housing this Fall? I\u2019m transferring from Berkeley City College and looking pretty much anywhere that\u2019s somewhat affordable. I\u2019ve tried Craigslist but a lot of places want an application and I don\u2019t think I have any credit. (Not bad credit just no credit history) so I\u2019m pretty scared I\u2019ll get turned away after paying half a months rent out in application fees. \nThanks!",

            "comment": "I understand how you feel I feared that when I moved here a year ago too. If you have the ability to, find a roommate , lots of people are looking but with my experience (I\u2019m now I\u2019m my second apartment off campus) you should look in to getting a cosigner like a parent or someone you trust with good credit and most places here don\u2019t care your a college student and a lot of places expect you to have a 650 credit score or higher (again in my experience) . Also look up \u201ccsu living for Chico state\u201d and a few housing places off nord Ave by the school will pop up that are affordable.  I think they\u2019re called the Timbers and a few other places but your best bet is looking for roomates unless you have a bf/gf that\u2019s willing to move up here with you. It\u2019s a lot easier to get a place with others rather than by yourself. Also, here is a website for housing communities that have partnered with csu Chico to help students get off campus housing. https://www.csuchico.edu/offcampus/connection/index.shtml \nHope this helps!",

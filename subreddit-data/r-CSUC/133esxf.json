            "comment": "Yes, totally normal for Chico. Not for other schools. I work in the college of Business. We're calling admitted students to remind them that the intent to enroll is due on May 1st. Lots of first year and transfer students forget to do the intent after they've been admitted. Then fall comes around and they aren't actually enrolled. \n\nIf you chose finance as your option you very well could have spoken with me. If you already committed to another school some of us will ask where just to help us out with knowing where other people want to go. One woman I talked to chose another school that I knew about so I told her some things to do for that school too. It's really just a way for us to help the students navigate going to college since not everyone has parents who can help them.",

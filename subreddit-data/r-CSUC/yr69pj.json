So for class we built a program that takes a song and shortens and learns what the \"best\" 10-60 seconds are to you\n\nIt helps you find your next favorite song, go through your discover weekly/release radar, and add to your playlists, faster\n\nUses genre/class/valence/key/BPM/chorus/bridge and other factors\n\nApp Store link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775)\n\nWould love any feedback/criticisms/feature requests, thanks :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56uv7zcw62z91.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f02edf3921cb256904d9d480c34b4a2ec91f8a83",

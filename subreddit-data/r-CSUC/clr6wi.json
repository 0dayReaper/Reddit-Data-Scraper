            "comment": "Not entirely sure about UV specific but for dorm life in general consider the following:\n\n1. Something to make you comfortable. Maybe pictures of friends, books you enjoy or games you like. Just be certain to bring things you can stand to lose, I am sure the RAs are good people but things get lost and forgotten so maybe dont bring your 200 year old ceremonial bagpipes.\n2. Something to keep you sane. Like other guy said video games are good, card games are too. Hell even board games are cool right now and if you dont have any there are plenty of places in town within walking distance to get some. A computer is almost a must, even if it's just to keep tabs on school and finances.\n3. Something to feed yourself with. I like to pretend like I'm camping when I go to hotels or dorms. I bring foods that either are easy to make with minimum refrigeration or an item I can use to make lots of food that will last a while. This sounds silly but peanutbutter and honey sandwiches could be the greatest thing to happen to you.\n4. MANY things to keep you healthy. Bring your own toiletries, if you drop one on the bathroom floor, it's dead to you. WEAR SANDALS IN THE SHOWER. Dont share razors, toothpaste etc. If your personal items go missing and you find them the next day, they're dead to you. Extreme yes but part of meeting and living near so many people is all the fun conditions they bring. Get you some Clorox wipes, windex wipes and some decent hand sanitizer. Keep your things clean and keep yourself clean and hopefully the colds that blow through campus will pass you by.\n\n5.Dont be a fool, wrap your tool. Doesnt matter if your into dudes or chicks or whatever your about, learn about how to use contraceptives and in the very least get some if you plan on being sexually active. You'll save yourself trips to the doctors office.\n\nLastly bring an open mind. Ok this sounds dumb as hell but almost everything you know is going to be challenged, changed or confronted in college. Learning to accept new information while holding on to your beliefs can be challenging so find a group of people or club that do stuff your into, but dont be afraid to try the many new things chico has to offer.\n\nI personally suggest you start by going to Donut nook, burrito bandit, Woodstock pizza and smokin mos bbq but that's just me. Ooh and morning thunder for breakfast too...",

            "comment": "As far as things that, in my opinion, are necessary for the dorms, I recommend the following. They might be obvious to some, or not as necessary to some, but this is just my experience from my year in the dorms.\n\n1. Get some dedicated shower shoes/flip flops. You don't want your bare feet on those bathroom floors or on that shower floor even. It's shared with everyone, and you'll soon learn what ends up on those floors. You should also get a dedicated shower caddie or bag for all your hygiene needs, it makes for easy transport from your room to the bathroom, and keeps it all in one place. The bathrooms do have lockers, but I don't recommend them personally, but that's up to you.\n\n2. A matress pad or memory foam pad of some sorts. While I've definitely slept on worse, those beds do kinda suck, and you'll be there for a whole year, and it might get uncomfortable fast. The bed size is a twin, so keep that in mind when getting a pad, and with sheets and bed sets and such\n\n3. A water filter. While not undrinkable by any means, Chico water can be pretty gross sometimes (though I admit, I come from the the middle of nowhere, Backcountry mountains, so I'm spoiled on water quality), and having a filter can really help make it taste less like pool water and just add a sense of security of sorts, and trust me, drink LOTS of water. It gets hot in Chico during warmer seasons.\n\nAs far as general tips, get a clock and get a calendar! Time management is key, and both can really help make sure you aren't late to classes and don't miss due dates, plus it just kinda helps ground. personally, I just lose tracks of days and weeks way too easily, college has a way it doing that. Also, don't be afraid to interact with your RA. They are there to help you and to make sure you feel welcome and comfortable and to help with any questions or issues you have. Roommate issues? Don't know how to get something fixed in your room? Questions about campus or classes or college in general? Ask your RA. And if your RA sucks (because yeah, it does happen), then don't be afraid to reach even higher up the food chain to report issues about said RA or any other concerns. It's your home for a year, and you have every right to be as comfortable as possible. Don't forget that. Especially since you're paying so much to be there.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "Assuming you're sharing a place with someone (I think most of those are 2bd 1ba?)\n\nLaptop / tablet for watching Netflix at night. Or studying. That too. There are computer labs but nothing beats being able to stay in bed and chill.\n\nHeadphones in case you have a roommate (these are nice for the short walk to campus as well).\n\nInstapot? Some minimal cooking tools? If you spend your money too much elsewhere it'll be nice to be able to survive off more than microwavable ramen.\n\nSheets / pillow cases. IMO I like sleeping on my own sheets. If you bring a second set, you could bring a small storage bin to keep those under your bed.\n\nA cheap game console can be nice. I'm cautious of bringing anything expensive to a shared living area, but if you have an N64 / gamecube you can make a ton of friends real quick.\n\nA lot of people might think about bringing a bike. IMO Chico has too many bike thieves to bring a bike. Especially anywhere near downtown. A longboard is nice though. You can easily store that inside.\n\nSwimsuit. There's a pool and a hot tub IIRC. Chico summers get hot. A quiet fan might be a good idea too.\n\nThere's a Safeway and Walgreens right there so you can buy any small necessities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChico's not too expensive so all of this can be bought when you get here. Just figure out what you like to do to pass the time and bring that. I'd lean against bringing anything too expensive as it could get stolen / broken, but that might be personal preference.  \n\n\nOne last note if you haven't been to college before. Classwork comes and goes in waves. Sometimes you don't have anything to do for a week or two. Othertimes you're taking back-to-back low-sleep nights just to keep up with it. Bring something that will help you stay focused (Headphones for me), and something to do in those weeks with nothing to do. If you leave your time open, you'll end up at a house party or a bar. Not that house parties and bars are bad, but showing up to either on a Tuesday afternoon is a bad sign.",

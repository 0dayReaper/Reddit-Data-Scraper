I've gone to bigger schools with Division I sports that still didn't have as good facilities as WREC.\n\nIt's really cool that on top of traditional gym equipment, there are also several multi-purpose rooms (used for yoga, dance, martial arts, etc), an indoor track, climbing walls, a couple swimming pools, as well as a dedicated space for Futsal (indoor soccer) and floor hockey in addition to traditional basketball courts.\n\nI've gone to several gyms in town and the WREC is the best, even topping In Motion, which is also an impressive and large gym facility.",

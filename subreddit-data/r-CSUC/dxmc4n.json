While going through the university's website to look for the course structure, I did not find any detailed information about the courses offered under the computer science department. If anyone here has some pdf/any relevant material, please share. It will be really helpful for me. TIA",

In short, our MS program is going to emphasize getting practical, hands-on experience that will be relevant to computer science careers.\n\nHere is the [catalog of current requirements](http://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/19/CSCI/CSCINONEMS.html) to fulfill the MS degree.",

However, even the undergraduate degree involves upper-division classes that program in other languages.\n\nSome people who enter the MS program will have already completed equivalent courses to that C++ core so they won't have to take them here. The graduate classes (once completing the programming core) use a variety of different programming languages and include courses in Applied Machine Learning, Web Development, Software Design and Maintenance (which I teach and will require programming in languages other than C++), and others.",

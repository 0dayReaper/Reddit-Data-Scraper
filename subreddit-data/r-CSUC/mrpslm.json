I can\u2019t speak for his in person classes, but last semester there were only about 5-7 people who passed Diff Equations. I\u2019m taking him again this semester and already we\u2019ve had a ton of people drop",

I highly recommend you have a strong background in Trig and ideally have taken a pre-calc class first. I\u2019d check the requirements for both because in order to take 120 you need to have taken 119 and Trig",

I mean, is Depot Park any further away? Are they offering anything ro the city to incentivize this? \"Think of the children\" seems like a cop out. It's a very myopic view they're taking on the situation.",

            "comment": "Okay, I kind of get two of the major \"sides\".\n\nIf there is a place for people to go that can't go to the other shelters because of drugs, alcohol, criminal record, etc (Low Barrier) then they are off the streets during the evening. However, that becomes a hub that they then radiate from during the day.\n\nHowever, the people going to shelters are statistically more likely to get help off the streets and with their addiction. \n\nThis is a complex situation, but in the end people need help. It is all about money at this point, CSUC doesn't want to have the same image problem University of Portland did a few years ago when the homeless problem exploded.\n\nOr, Chico City Council could get their heads out of their asses, let the dispensaries open, tax the shit out of it and pay for a bunch of new public works that way and make the streets better than third world again. But, let's make it about the \"homeless\" rather than the system that makes it so hard to break out of poverty.",

            "comment": "I mean, I get it. It's a low barrier shelter so it's inviting people who are going to be under the influence of any number of substances from alcohol to opiates. Even if none of these people are actually criminals or predators of any kind (though technically they would be if possessing and using illegal drugs like heroin), the simple fact of being under the influence of these substances could create risky and threatening situations for themselves and the people around them\u2014which in this instance would largely be students whom the university is responsible for in many ways.\n\nThis issue is compounded by the idea of putting such a shelter in a neighborhood where there are a couple of elementary schools that have vulnerable children in them.\n\nReally I think that if they *must* construct a low barrier shelter, it might be prudent to put it out by the airport and maybe providing some kind of transportation to it once or twice a day.",

These people are already here, they just don't have a shelter.\n\n&gt;put it out by the airport\n\nThat sounds extremely inconvenient. Additionally they've moved Paradise students into a building by the airport so you'd still have the issue of it being near students.",

Much less right in the midst of these neighborhoods? \n\nPlacing a low barrier shelter on the edge of town may be the right kind of compromise where the benefits are indeed available for homeless, without exposing the neighborhood (or the campus) to users under the influence or the instruments they leave behind.",

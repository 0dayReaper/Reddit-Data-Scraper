If you have a pulse you can get in basically, especially if you\u2019re transferring from a local JC. According to Peterson\u2019s the school has a 65% acceptance rate.",

            "comment": "How much aid you get depends on a lot of factors, like your family history and economic status as well as your own achievements. 2.8 GPA isn't particularly impressive. You probably won't be declined because of it, but I wouldn't expect much interest from scholarships. A lot of the ones I see ask for 3.0 or higher (solid B).\n\nI don't have many merit scholarships (didn't apply to many although I qualify for a lot with a 3.6 gpa, my background, and my major). Instead I get a lot of aid due to financial need. I'm an independent student from a disadvantaged educational and economic background (high school drop out, neither parent attended college, grew up poor and lived in poverty until recently), so I have low expected family contribution (EFC). My Pell Grant, CAL Grant B, and the State University Grant cover all or almost all of my tuition and the 1-2 scholarships I earn cover the rest. \n\nIf you're really concerned about paying for school then I'd echo someone elses suggestion and start at a community college. You can go to one that's far away from home while still saving money. Butte College is local to Chico and has some great programs and is very inexpensive. Many instructors (common for lower division courses) teach at both colleges so you'll get the same education for a fraction of the cost. I started at Butte and Pell Grant alone was enough to cover tuition, books/materials, and food for the entire semester.",

            "comment": "In terms of 4 year bachelors programs, Chico (all CSUs really) is the cheapest option in the country for California residents. Tuition is about $3,800 a semester. Cost of living is relatively low in Chico, with rent for a private room in a multi bedroom house/apartment being between $400-$700 a month. Other expenses (e.g. groceries, gas, and food) are also much lower in Chico than the Bay Area and LA. \n\nOn whether or not you'll get in - if you have above a 3.0 and a mediocre SAT score you will be fine.",

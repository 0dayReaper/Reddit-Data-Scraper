    "postText": "Just wanted to let any new students (and long time students who aren't aware) know that the Financial Wellness Clinic is an office on campus that is available to help you with financial planning needs. They serve students, faculty and staff and cover topics ranging from budgeting to repaying student loans to credit counseling and even retirement planning. \n\nYou can book an appointment for a 1-on-1 financial planning meeting with a trained planner to review your personal finances and help you get things in order.\n\nvisit [www.csuchico.edu/financialwellness](https://www.csuchico.edu/financialwellness) for more info and to book an appointment. Or email [financialwellness@csuchico.edu](mailto:financialwellness@csuchico.edu) \n\nNote: The FWC doesn't file your taxes for you. VITA in the accounting office does that. And we don't give legal advice, CLIC in the College of BSS does that. But we can refer you to either of those offices if needed.",

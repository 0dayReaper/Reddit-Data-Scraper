After that I did the least amount of swipes with the most amount of flex cash and it was perfect. Never ran out of swipes and had lots of flex cash to spend around campus. I definitely recommend going the less swipes and more flex cash route.",

I used to live in UV and since we had an entire kitchen I opted for more flex cash than swipes but the swipe\u2019s definitely came in handy for meals in-between classes if I had large gaps and didn\u2019t have time or want to head home. It was also nice to have swipes for when having friends visit from out of town as you can \u201cswipe\u201d for them at sutter dining and eat together.",

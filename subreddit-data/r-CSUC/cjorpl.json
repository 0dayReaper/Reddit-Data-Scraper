    "postText": "debating whether I should bring my car or not. \nIt\u2019s a very long drive for me (10 hours). am I able to leave my car on campus during holidays/ over winter break? Ideally, I would like to leave my car for a full school year on campus then take it back for Summer break. \nAlso, those that didn\u2019t take their car to Chico how is it? I\u2019m going to live at UV I know I can walk to campus, however I\u2019m concerned about when I need to get groceries because having your car around definitely would make it easier when you have to buy a lot. Any advice would help thank you.",

If not, then I would advise against it cause it's really not one of those towns where you can always find a spot somewhere for it - basically all parking is paid parking.\n\nI _think_ you can leave your car there over winter but I'd call the campus to check to be sure.\n\nAnd generally everything within town is within walking distance so it's not _essential_ to have, but it is nice to be able to get out of town if you want as it can be easy to feel trapped without a form of long distance travel",

Safeway is where most students go but it's the equivalent of Whole Foods down south, expensive as hell and best way for your bill to come out high! Best place to go is WinCo which is cheap, has everything u need. Only downside is that it's about a 10 min drive on the other side of school. For parking you can park anywhere, just make sure to check the parking signs. Lots of free parking around campus.",

    "postText": "Hey friends!\nI am looking for someone to take over my lease at Westpark Plaza. \n It's about one mile away from campus, and about 3.5 miles from Butte College's Chico Center. I'm in a 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment. Rent is $1100 per month. Water and trash are covered in rent. Security deposit is $900. There are currently three people on the lease, and we're all moving, so I imagine 1-4 people could sign on (1 couple and a friend, 2 couples, 2 individuals, etc.). It's a really nice place, and our apartment is right by the pool/laundry room and the main office.\nIt's a second story apartment with a cute little balcony (that includes a grill!). New floors were put in before we moved in, and we will clean the carpets before we go. We are moving into our new house on June 1st, so if you want to move in the day after that, we can make it happen!\nDM if you're interested. Thank you!",

    "postText": "I'm going to attend Chico this upcoming fall and was wondering where the chilliest dorms are? I want a single dorm with a kitchen etc and I know University Village has that but I want to be in a very social environment. Is UV best? I know I am looking forward to having A LOT of fun at Chico (parties, etc) so can someone let me know what hall is best? I need more info about them but right now I'm leaning for UV so someone let me know if that doesn't match what I'm looking for please!",

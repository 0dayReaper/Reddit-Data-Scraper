I want to find out more info about them because I'm interested in concentration in one of them. Also can you double major as a transfer student? I really want to double major.",

            "comment": "I just started my 3rd semester as a Rec. Arts major as a transfer. Its super time consuming being in the studio every week, but they are open 24/7, and staying in contact with your group members and bands. But that said, it is a fantastic program with awesome studios that are some of the best in Northern California. Theres plenty of folk double majoring in Music Industry and other things related. The music scene in Chico is also great, plenty of chances to perform and find people who want to be recorded. Anything specific you wanted to know about?\n\nAlso, if you want to take a tour or just get more in-depth info on the program email or talk to Dan. https://www.csuchico.edu/muta/programs/ba-music/recording-arts.shtml",

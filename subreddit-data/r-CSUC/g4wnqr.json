The staff is really nice and I know they have an honors club (I think?) that I\u2019ve been told gives really great opportunities for internships and extracurricular stuff",

Research is pretty abundant, you just got to know the professor. They\u2019re all super nice and caring. Most of them are here to teach, not research. The research is still great though. Every year there is a sustainability conference. I got my first internship there after my freshman year. We have a club called Omicron Theta Epsilon. It is the Chico State Biology Honors Society. We meet every other Wednesday and eat all you can eat Celestino\u2018s pizza. It\u2019s a great chance to get know the professors. I\u2019m one of the head members and I\u2019m planning a trip to Monterey bay aquarium next spring, hopefully all expenses paid. In general is a great place to make friends and develop a strong community! It\u2019s really made a difference in my life and I really miss it right now. It\u2019s not really a frat, but is technically one. \n\nFrom what I know, waterpolo is like a frat/ sorority. It\u2019s pretty fun. I know they compete all the time. Personally I think I\u2019d be really hard to do the first year of bio while also doing polo. \n\nFeel free to message me if you have any more question! Congrats and welcome!",

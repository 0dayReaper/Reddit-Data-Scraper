Everything to do with housing is not conducted through your student portal. It is conducted through the resident center. Here is the [link](https://www.csuchico.edu/housing/index.shtml) \n\nScroll down to resident login. Use your CSU Chico info to log in. Just look around the portal and see if you see anything. Sometimes if you click on profile it will tell you where you are living.",

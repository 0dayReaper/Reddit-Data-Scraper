    "postText": "Hey there everyone, I\u2019m a student here at chico state. Not sure if this is allowed but I\u2019ve been pondering an idea for a new platform for a while and have been receiving solid feedback. I currently own one successful online business and have the sales, marketing experience to contribute to the project in mind, along with capital to fund it in its early stages. My current business takes up only a smaller portion of my week (~15 hrs) so I have plenty of time to dedicate to the project. \n\n\nI\u2019d initially planned on hiring someone but I\u2019d rather have someone on board with a permanent interest in the company. Though I\u2019m happy to offer pay as well / instead. I\u2019m more specifically looking for a full stack dev thats also a student ( I know, might be hard to find ). Anyways if anyones interested feel free to reach out, I\u2019d love to meet up on campus to discuss. I really do see a need not being fulfilled, and think we can take advantage of that.",

Usually from business students who have a \"great idea\" and they \"just\" need someone to actually write the code and implement the idea in exchange for a small percentage of equity in the company (after all, coming up with the idea is the hard part, right?)\n\nIf you plan on going through with one of these, get cash up front.",

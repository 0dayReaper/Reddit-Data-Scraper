I used to work in a machine shop before I came to csuc and asked the professor what we\u2019d be doing in those courses and he said basically using cncs, lathes , etc. also a little bit of welding! The classes however are structured and you make certain items but I\u2019m sure if you have certain ideas you can bring it up with the professor and he could see if it would be a possibility to do extra things on your own time. I recommend Scott brogden he\u2019s a great professor!",

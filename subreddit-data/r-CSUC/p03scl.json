Im planning on going for 3 years(total of 5 counting CC) to hopefully lessen my workload and let me have a good balance between school, social and work\n2. does anyone know of certain areas or apartment complexes that are mostly students? wanted to move into the dorms but they only let transfers go to UV, and since id be cooking for myself but I'm not allowed to have my own mini freezer, ik I can't fit all my food in a fridge shared with 6-8 ppl\n3. does anyone have advice for picking between a furnished vs unfurnished apartment? while its cost a little extra ik id love decorating my own room/theming it but don't know if I should obviously choose one over the other",

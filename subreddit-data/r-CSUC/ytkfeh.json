I have muscular dystrophy and ehlers danlos. Not yet in a wheelchair, but I will probably be using my walker. \nThank you! \ud83d\ude03",

I don't think you'll have any problems.  \n\nLarge bathroom stalls and single-person bathrooms are also fairly common.\n\n I'll keep an eye out and let you know if I find any evidence to the contrary.",

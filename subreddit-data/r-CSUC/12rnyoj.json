    "postText": "Hello, I'm thinking about transferring to Chico but I wanted to know if I would be able to take English courses online for a Bachelor's degree because Chico is rather far from where I'm at in Los Angeles. It's not exactly my forte to attend in person but I'm asking more so because I think it'd be better financially if I attended without living on-campus or close to it in an apartment.",

            "comment": "You can take SOME online English classes online at chico but Chico (like your GE classes have more variety and come in online sections) doesn\u2019t have a full online English degree,  but if you\u2019re looking for a fully online program I\u2019d suggest ASU or LSU which both have fully online English programs.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the degree you\u2019re getting is so I\u2019m assuming English. Chico state only offers a BA in Humanities , liberal studies , multicultural and gender studies , religious studies, social studies, and social science, and the BS in Business admin fully online. \n\nWhen you start getting more in to upper division coursework you\u2019re less likely to see online classes considering we\u2019re not in covid anymore. If finances are an issue you should go to a community college for your first two years then Transfer in. I did . It\u2019s cheaper and you get all your lower division and GE done and community colleges offer just about every class online except science classes that require lab work. \n\nHope this helps",

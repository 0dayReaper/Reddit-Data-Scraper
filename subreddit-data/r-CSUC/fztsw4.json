One of the primary downsides for me right now is that csu la is in a sketchy part of town and a lot of students say driving is the best mode of transportation, which I\u2019m not doing. How would y\u2019all describe the convenience of getting to nearby stores in Chico and do you think it\u2019s safe?",

            "comment": "Walking and biking to class is the main mode of transportation to campus. Driving and parking is a nightmare and if you plan on getting to any class after 9am by car you better leave early and be ready to make some loops before you find a spot. \n\nThat being said the town is a mix of safe and not safe. When college students are around it is the safest. Outside of that there are some pretty sketchy local people.\n\nIt isn't any worse than you'll find in other college towns in CA. Follow some normal safety precautions. Get some pepperspray, if you ride a bike always lock it up in the best way possible. If going anywhere past sundown always go in a group etc. \n\nSource: Am a big heavy 6' tall dude who lived in Chico as a student and then resident from 2014-2019 and walking was my main form of transportation. Nothing ever directly happened to me but as an ex-student and then ex-instructor for chico I've heard my fair share of happenings.\n\nExample 1: I have a friend who has permanent nerve damage. He's a big ass dude, taller than me, and like 220 all muscle, got jumped by some guys while bar hopping and was out for the rest of the semester. This was like 4 years ago and he still suffers.  \n\nExample 2: In one of my last nights out while in Chico me and my friends were chased down by a homeless man swinging a razor scooter and random people. A friend of mine was almost bashed in the back of the head by it because no one noticed him sneaking up on her. We later spotted various other groups trying to chase him down after something happened in another area of town.",

Chico\u2019s highest crimes are things like assaults and thefts, and a lot of those are tied to the school (assaults: a lot of parties get out of hand, thefts: a lot of stolen bikes and south campus break-ins, etc). \n\nBut all things considered, it\u2019s still going to be a better bet than CSULA, I would imagine. Cheaper too.",

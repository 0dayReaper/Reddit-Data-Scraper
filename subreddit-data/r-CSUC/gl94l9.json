    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm having a bit of trouble understanding why online classes are causing people to want to take the semester off? There's still classes, they're just online...I get the price complaints, but we're still being offered classes to take. So why not continue progressing toward your degree?Can someone fill me in? I'm kind of dumbfounded.",

That isn't just opinion, there is pretty comprehensive evidence that suggests that online education is sub-par and is particularly ineffective for students who are already in the most vulnerable circumstances.\n\nWith that said, moving forward with your education is a smart investment and more so when the economy is on a downturn. If you can make progress toward a degree that will have impacts on your professional career, even (less effective) online education is probably a good choice over delaying graduation if you can afford it.",

I have taken online classes for years and the design of the modules, and the course content are critical. Unfortunately a lot of teachers approached this crisis by just lecturing over Zoom and giving more assignments. \n\nThe best online teachers I\u2019ve experienced were at Butte, and years later I still remember content from their English, History and Anthropology classes. The work could be done in a few hours one day a week and it was a variety of lectures, films, reading material and other online content.",

Effectiveness of online (vs in-person classroom) education is an empirical question, and that question has been studied quite a bit. Some students still perform well in either situation and maybe you fall in this category. However, overall, there are worse learning outcomes from online education.\n\nIf you don't want to take my word for it, here's a [tweet thread from a professor at MIT's Teaching Systems Lab](https://twitter.com/bjfr/status/1237396247180238849) that summarizes the research (with citations) pretty clearly, even for non-researchers.",

I can hear the tv on, there is my PS4 tempting me to play, and if my home is dirty all I end up doing is cleaning instead of doing my class work. Second, In class lectures help so much, instead of going through power points. It is quiet and can listen to my professors w/o any distractions. Third, what I noticed with online classes that I took, you receive more assignments that you would if you took it not online. The reason is so you can teach yourself some of the material. That is alot of work if you take more than 1 online class. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I did like that I can do my school work anytime, but that was a problem for me. It would make me procrastinate so much which would stress me out even more. If I am going to pay for courses, I want them to be in class because it will benefit me more.",

The \"transition\" for my classes this semester just turned into extra assignments with zero effort to have any kind of lecture, Zoom or otherwise. So it felt like being completely on my own, with no choice other than to bite the bullet and do what I could - that is an impossible way for me to learn. \n\nI've been getting in touch with the professors for the classes I'm interested in to see what kind of plans they have in place at this point in time. If the plans (1) don't include the same amount of actual Zoom lecture time (3 hours once a week), where I can ask questions and engage in discussion, it's not worth my time or money and (2) if it doesn't sound like the professor has any idea what the format for the class will look like, I'm not committing to it either. 2 of the 3 I've asked about sound like they fit in my criteria and I'm feeling a lot better about next semester. So I encourage anyone who isn't sure to email the professors and ask questions. Remember that this is YOUR time and money your spending, that you can never get back.",

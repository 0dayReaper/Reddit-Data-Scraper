The inner room numbers go up slower because there are fewer of them than there are outer rooms. If you start at room 101, room 102 will be right across the hall, but by the time you get to the 170s on the outside you'll see 140 on the inside. I always heard that the algorithm thing was just a rumor they tell you at orientation.",

    "postText": "So I got Shasta Hall as my dorm and I\u2019m happy with it. I didn\u2019t want a dorm as loud as Whitney or as quiet as Sutter. But I recently learned that Shasta has some business community program that includes business majors. I was just wondering if I\u2019m going to be surrounded by only Business majors, cause personally I would prefer more diverse majors.",

            "comment": "It's just a small section that is designated as the buisness area. If you aren't a buisness major or did not specifically ask to be in the buisness LLC( Living Learning Community), then you will not be in it. Every hall has an LLC and it does not really change diversity of majors. Unless you are in a konkow house, which you aren't. You should be fine. Plus I would say try not to worry about things so much. Everyone wants their first year to be perfect but if you try too hard to make things perfect then you will dislike anything that isn't \"perfect\". Just sit back and let the year happen. Give your placement a few weeks before you decide that you don't enjoy it.",

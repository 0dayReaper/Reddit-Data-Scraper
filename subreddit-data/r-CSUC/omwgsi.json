    "postText": "I am considering attending CSU Chico due to its close proximity, meaning I can commute and its relatively cheap tuition. However, I'm worried that medical schools will look down on CSU's compared to UC's. I'm also curious about the resources available at CSU Chico for premeds. Like how many research opportunities, internships, etc. are there?",

            "comment": "Quick story to make you feel more confident in choosing premed at Chico: \n\nI went to the emergency room this January for abdominal pain. Turns out I needed an appendectomy.  Everyone talked about my surgeon like he was a god and swore he was the best to do the procedure. I wore my Chico state hoodie at post-op a week later and he informed me that he did his undergrad at Chico state. Great doctors can come from CSU\u2019s, not just UC\u2019s.\n\nIf you get the opportunity to go to Chico, you should. They have a premed club with lots of guest speakers. The career center can help you find internships or volunteer opportunities. I think being able to land great experiences that end up with solid letters of recommendation is just as important as the school you attend. Good luck!!!",

            "comment": "Your undergrad isn\u2019t as important, as long as you fulfill the pre-recs required and get good experiences, you will be well off. Plus, it may be easier/less competitive to get opportunities at Chico versus at a UC. 100% choose Chico over the UCs. Although I am not pre-med, I was in the same position and Chico was by far better. I have gotten more opportunities and have found it less competitive than what I would have gotten if I went to a UC school.",

            "comment": "Speaking as a pre-med applying now, I would say it depends. Like others have said, it might be much easier to get some opportunities here than at UCs. When I sought volunteering and research experiences it was pretty easy to find multiple options in the area. I'm sure getting into a stem research lab at a UC would have been much more difficult than it was for me.\n\nHowever, the pre med support is basically nonexistent at an administrative level. Be prepared to do all the research, planning, studying, networking all on your own. The pre med advisor really doesn't have a good grasp on the medical school process, hes a professor and it's a side role. I received completely wrong info multiple times and certain requirements. \n\nAdditionally, the pre med club is a joke. I have attended multiple meetings and know some people that run it. It's mostly just a thing to put on an application that you were a part of for a few years. They try their best relating topics to the pre med experience, but I didn't feel like it was worth my time continuing. \n\nAnother thing to understand is that the city of chico does not have enough MDs to care for its population. Before covid, I search for a general practitioner and couldn't find any accepting new patients. This translates to less medical \"clinical experience\" jobs, creating much more competition. It might be even worse now with covid, I'm not sure.\n\nVery importantly, the quality of education may be worse at chico. That doesn't mean that you can't put in the effort to \"catch up\" to the UC students, but it's something to keep in mind. I have talked with a real med school application reviewer and he told me that basically, a 4.0 at CSUC is a 3.2 at a much \"better\" school. Keep in mind that you will be expected to completely dominate all your classes, which is very very difficult.\n\nDont take this as a complete deterrent, you can definitely make it to med school with a CSUC education, but understand what you're losing/gaining with it. You will have to go out and make sure you're doing everything right.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about the process, feel free to pm me. Ik the pre med experience is a completely depressing mess and I'd be happy to help lighten your load.",

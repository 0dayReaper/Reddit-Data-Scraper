    "postText": "hey guys, thinking of transferring but i plan to take 3 years instead of 2 at whatever college i go to, in order to make sure i can develop/learn coding skills fully as I'm so new. But, i was wondering how much time as a CS major u feel either A u have outside of ur school work or B how much time u think u have to devote to it.",

It allowed me to finish my course work, have some time for myself, and keep my mental health in check. Just because some people can take 16-18 units doesn't mean you have to. Going at your own pace is the way to go.\n\n\nI would recommend looking at the courses and seeing what ones will be the most difficult and the ones that will be somewhat easier and match them together accordingly.",

            "comment": "Depends on your study skills tbh. I came into CE program with none, cuz I never had to study in general ed classes or high school. Most I can handle is two STEM classes atm, though maybe that's cuz I'm getting into the upper division stuff. With 2 classes I have time on the weekend to unwind and can go to the gym almost every day\n\nI have some friends that take 3-5 STEM classes and manage it somehow. Mostly by having very little free time\n\nI'd say you'll probably spend at least 2-10 hours a week out of class on homework if you're working for an A. I'm not really an expert tho so take that with a grain of salt",

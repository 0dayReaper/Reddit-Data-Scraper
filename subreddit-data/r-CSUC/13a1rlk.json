The party culture really isn\u2019t welcoming to anyone who doesn\u2019t like to drink and actually wants to study and I can\u2019t find friends that want to do the same. \n\nAnyone know any good theater arts schools that have an opposite culture?",

There's also that adventure outings thing I've heard about. I'm sure there are lots of opportunities for socializing if you look closer :)",

For me, I felt like I was missing out on something better by staying here. It\u2019s a small town, there\u2019s not much to do, and it\u2019s far from a big city. \n\nStill, Chico can be great for some. You just have to find a reason to be here. There\u2019s tons of great programs on campus. Whether that be theater, or Greek life, or joining a club. You gotta get invoked on campus or you\u2019ll just be stuck in a small town living a mediocre day-to-day. \n\nMy advice is: double down at Chico or move out asap. \n\nIt might not be for you. Go to SoCal. I think it\u2019s safe to assume there are some great theater schools there. +you\u2019ll be in a much more diverse environment than the party culture at chico.                     Best wishes.",

It\u2019s a system that is built to hide the crimes (sexual assaults and drunken overdoses) of its members and encourages more of those crimes to feed its blackmail machine to keep itself running. The types of people it attracts are all very insecure people who need to verify themselves with systems of power.",

There's a party culture or isolated academically minded students. but some schools lean more to one than the other. \n\nYou can check out another university's subreddit and it'll look the same: \"I can't meet people because everyone comes to class then goes home.\" \"People are so competitive that they don't want to socialize or form study groups.\" \"The frat culture is so elitist. They only interact with one another and exclude everyone else.\"\n\nIt's rough everywhere.\n\nThe only way you're going to meet like minded people is to join clubs. On campus and off.",

I just doubled down and started working on campus and that honestly really helped since I found people I\u2019d see regularly and eventually became friends with them. Clubs are kinda hit or miss unfortunately, if you know where to look you\u2019ll be able to find some cool people. Best of luck",

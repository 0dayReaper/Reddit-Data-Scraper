[It'll also meet an upper division GE if you go down the Ethics/Justice/Policy pathway.](https://www.csuchico.edu/aap/_assets/documents/fillable-ge-planning-sheet.pdf)\n\nI don't know what her format is for online classes since I took it last spring, but generally it was Lecture/movie, quick discussion (or discussion board) with other people (around 1x a week), 2 or 3 event analysis (she gives you the event and outlines how to analyze it so it's pretty easy), 1 \"research\" event analysis (you pick the event, she outlines how to analyze it similar to the other ones), 1 implicit bias \"research component\" (you go to a website she provides and take a quiz, then do a write up on your experiences), and a couple of exams. \n\nThe exams were closed book when we did them in person, I can't remember what she did when we went online. When we went online it was asynchronous but that might've changed this semester. Overall it was a really relaxed class, just the material is emotionally heavy.\n\nI find a lot of EDTE classes to be pretty relaxed, but you might not be interested in them since they're for future teachers. EDTE 302 is a pretty typical sociology, equity class but with a focus on the educational system and what teachers can do to improve equity and access. We did a couple of essays examining our past and stuff. I'm not sure what it's like in an online setting, though.",

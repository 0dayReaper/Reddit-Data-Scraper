Good job ladies - with friends like you who needs enemies?\n\nI acknowledge that the content of the signs might not have been correct. Big surprise, that's politics for you. Political signs aren't capable of having a nuanced discussion about complicated issues.  Quite the opposite. They are meant to trigger the audience and generate passion.  I would say those signs did one hell of a good job.\n\nStealing signs off the lawn is wrong and it's sure as hell isn't free speech. Denying others a chance to speak (even if it's misleading) is not \"freedom of speech.\"  Trying to steal someone's phone because you are afraid of being filmed... that shows they felt ashamed of their behavior.  That tells me they knew they were wrong. They had enough energy to steal signs but not enough energy to present a counter-argument or to try and convince other's the signs were wrong.  \n\nIf they want to dispute the signs by CSUC process or by posting opposing arguments/signs that's their right. Instead they tried to silence others' free speech.  ",

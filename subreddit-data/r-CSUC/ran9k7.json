    "postText": "I've applied for Fall '22, have toured campus and am pretty interested in Chico State! My main concern, though, is that the town seems pretty far from everything... I'm from the North Bay (3 hours away) and am very used to having towns/cities/etc to explore within less than an hour's drive and around every corner. So, I have a few questions for Chico students who, like me, are used to living in places with more active surrounding areas:\n\nDo you ever get bored in Chico? \n\nDo you feel isolated? That's what I'm most afraid of. \n\nHow active is the social life and what's it like? \n\nWhat are summers like\u00a0\u2013 do most people go home? \n\nWhat does a typical week/weekend consist of? \n\nThanks :)",

            "comment": "Being bored in Chico is very easy if you do not find yourself hobbies/extra-curricular activities and a solid group of friends to keep yourself busy/having fun. \n\nComing from a big city as well, I felt very isolated (especially not having a car). Make friends with cars. My roommates always had cars so that definitely helped with the isolation feeling as we would go on weekend trips. \n\nChico has a really large social life. If you are underage, there are lots of clubs and things to do on campus. Off campus, a lot of partying in homes. 21+ there\u2019s are a lot of great bars and restaurants. The Bear was my favorite for dancing/food and Riley\u2019s if you want a typical crowded college bar setting. \n\nA LOT of people go home for the summers, especially early on into your college years. The longer you stay in Chico I have noticed more people stay for many reasons. \n\nA typical week in Chico/Chico State is doing school work during the week and hanging out/partying/going into nature on the weekends. \n\nWe someone who just left Chico after 6 years, there really is no other place like it. I miss it everyday. Enjoy it. Make the best of your time there. Literally 90% of students live within a mile radium from the school. It\u2019s FUN! You will find your people, hobbies, and passions here. I would recommend Chico State to ANYONE who wants the \u201cstereotypical\u201d college fun while also getting a quality education. Professors are also really dope.",

There is a ton of cool shit to do, and most of it is free which is great for the college budget.\n\nI too am from the Bay Area and only had a bike during my time in Chico and never had an issue getting around town. There is also plenty to explore in Chico, 1 mile is easy walking/biking/skateboarding distance and great to go swimming during the warm months, and also a great and easy trail during the fall. \n\nA car is necessary to do a lot of the really cool stuff like getting to Bidwell/ swimming holes and floating...but my favorite was going up with some buddies to the [Chico Frisbee Golf Course](https://goo.gl/maps/ZkWLLNzfr11MHU4v9). I sucked at frolf but it was one of my favorite things to do during the week since its in such a cool spot and looks over all of Chico. \n\nTo this day I miss the Chico bars / Social life as they are some of the best and cheapest bars I've ever been too. The Sierra Nevada brewery is amazing food/drinks and [Riley's](https://www.instagram.com/rileyschico/?hl=en) was also awarded the Barstool best college bar in America (even though I think there are many other bars in town worthy of this accolade as well). There are also a lot of cool musical artist that come through the Senator during the school year. \n\nI never felt isolated while at Chico, but more of an overwhelming sense of independence and freedom. Every year I found myself staying over summer breaks because staying in Chico always had way more cool shit to do then going back to the bay.",

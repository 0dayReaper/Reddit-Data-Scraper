Also, these are all designated off-campus apartment communities.  Meaning they are owned or operated by companies whose business is off-campus housing nationwide.  They aren't just apartment companies that happen to have students.  This is their business model.\n\n  \nWildcat Crossing Private 1 Bed/1 Bath: $1225-1285 (includes water &amp; trash pick up - might include more, but that is all they have listed/shows, where I am looking.)\n\nPost on Nord: Studio &amp; One Bed: $1691-$1885 (includes: utilities (water, sewer, trash pickup, electric with a Green Cap), premium cable package, wireless Internet, washer &amp; dryer)\n\nTimber Creek, Campus Walk, Pomona, &amp; Cedar Flats are going to advertise and lease by the bed (by the room) in a shared apartment.  So if you see anything about one bed - it is literally one bedroom in a shared space.  But, if you get a two bedroom, you could get matched with someone that is a grad student, and it really isn't that big of a deal.  Campus Walk is decent and newer.  The management company is newer than the ones that have Post &amp; Wildcat Crossing - and all of this DOES directly impact your experience. \n\n  \nLast one: you don't want to live at the Social (IMO - but someone can totally correct me).  \n\nI would recommend Post (if you end up going for a one bedroom), only because it includes the most in the rental rate, but both management companies are national and good.  But, I also don't know what your budget is.  \n\nAll of these are going to be relatively close to campus, but you can google each one to see the exact location, see the walking distance, street views, reviews, and their websites.  It is easier than looking on Zillow or something, now that you know which companies and properties to look for.  \n\nHopefully that helps.  :)",

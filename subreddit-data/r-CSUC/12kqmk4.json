Even with meters, but preferably without. \n\nAlso I know we\u2019re not supposed to park at Bidwell Mansion but how many of you do that get away with it? I see it during later classes for sure, but not sure about during earlier classes.",

I used to park there when I had a class in modoc. But I\u2019d recommend depending on the time of your class get there a little earlier than you usually would to ensure you can get a spot and don\u2019t have to park far. Especially if it\u2019s a mid day class between 9am - 12pm . There\u2019s also a public parking lot on first st and main in downtown behind the north state public radio building that people park at and walk as well but I think it uses the passport app (there\u2019s also a physical pay thing there too) people use that too and walk to campus",

They arent perfect (they cost a bit too) *but* one of the garages also houses a police station... can't get much safer than that.\n\nAs for elsewhere in town, I have not heard of big motorcycle theft. Bike theft is more common because you can easily sell it to whomever if you steal it from somewhere.",

    "postText": "I'm talking about the one that opens after the dining hall closes. I'm new this semester and I've heard it's better than the dining hall, but that's all I know about it. So, I'm wondering if it works the same as the dining hall or if it works differently. Also, is it in the dining hall after it closes or is it somewhere else?",

It\u2019s open from 7:30-12 I think most nights, though the closing time may differ depending on weekend/weekday. You line up at some doors to the right a bit from the main dining hall entrance doors and can use a meal swipe or money to pay.\n\nIMO it\u2019s alright. They used to have a proper cafe sorta deal over where wildcat den is now, and I loved that. Paninis, pizza, good sides. Now Late night is a different menu and options that I just don\u2019t prefer. But it\u2019s alright for what it is.",

For the dressing you\u2019ll need pesto, olive oil, and balsamic. You\u2019ve gotta kinda adjust based on your preferences, but I go light on the oil and heavy on the balsamic. Add a little salt and pepper to it. I haven\u2019t been able to find a jarred pesto that\u2019s as good as the stuff they buy at Sutter, so it\u2019s not 100% the same, but it\u2019s close.\n\nAlso, serve cold.",

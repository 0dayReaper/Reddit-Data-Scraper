Not sure if any will be available though, for the same reason.",

If anything is too loud, property mangers on site can take care of it for you. In terms of safety just stay at least 2 blocks away from the train tracks and you won't have to worry about a whole lot. Its usually just car break-ins anyways, but a general rule of thumb, mind the railway. (again, not many places are necessarily unsafe to my understanding)",

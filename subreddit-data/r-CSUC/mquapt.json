    "postText": "I have one son who is a 2nd year at Chico, but have been looking at schools for my younger son, and see that several of the CSUs have made recent announcements that they are planning a full return to campus this fall based on the Governor's announcement of the full reopening of the state on June 15.  However, upon looking at the class catalog at Chico for the fall, many of the classes are still listed as online only.  Is this expected to change?  SDSU pushed back their registration date for a few weeks so they could update everything to in-person.  Is anything like that planned at Chico?  Thanks.",

I go to Chico High, and they've been open in person for half a year already",

The CSU is also managed by the state, and the high school is governed locally. The local politicians in Chico don't exactly all believe COVID is a thing that exists...\n\nAlso 2-3 days a week is your typical college schedule for a class, if they're alternating you probably will only go in person a single day of the week.",

My sense is that they are making fall plans based on current guidelines (which would theoretically allow them to have in-person hybrid classes right now), while other schools are making fall plans based on state projections.",

    "postText": "I am just about wrapping up my last few classes at my community college and should graduate in the spring. I'm going to apply to CSUC and CSUN with the intent on doing game development as a career.\n\nI'm currently double majoring in Studio Art AAT and Political Science AAT.\n\nCSUC lools really interesting despite whatever reputation it may have. I hadn't even considered going here until the transfer secretary looked up universities that offered animation majors. Originally I was dead set on going to Northridge but aftet looking at Chico and the cost of housing, total number of students etc, it really hooked me and so now my #1 choice is Chico.\n\nBut is it worth it? As in, is the program for CAGD good or is it bs?",

There's more to college then just your degree.\n\nChico is an actual college, with dorms, greek life, campus that's walkable, etc.  It has awesome natural parks surrounding it, students are friendly and most people you meet live in town.\n\nNorthridge is a commuter school near LA.    If your focus is 100% on game design living near LA is going to make getting internships  and networking with people easier.  You won't get the actual college experience though.  Meet a cute girl in one of your classes?  She probably lives 30 minutes away with her family.\n\nPS.  I don't know much about the programs but realistically getting a job in the industry you want is selling yourself.  If you want to get into video game design then whatever classes to learn the skill used at that job but most importantly, start designing a game.  Someone is going to be much more impressed if you show them 3 games you created throughout college in Unity on your own time then they are if you just get a degree.",

They seem to be pretty satisfied with teachers and projects in general. Everyone is chill. I never heard anyone saying that the staff is not good enough. 3D modeling and animation is very complex, but I am enjoying it so far. The only thing that I heard that there is a really hardcore coding class that everyone has to take, and a lot of people fail it because it\u2019s very hard. I believe there is also the discord server for the game dev. Let me know what specific questions you have.",

            "comment": "Personally, as someone who's apart of the CAGD major, the major is worth going into, if you MAKE it worth it. You can just go through the motions, do the required classes, get your degree and be done with it, and it would amount just as much as if you got a computer science degree, in the eyes of people hiring you for development. What makes the major worth it, is taking advantage of the opportunities the professors try to give you. They teach you how to use all the industry standard software, they require you do an internship, they give you the opportunity to publish two different games under your name, recommend you go to conventions that devs attend, encourage you to build connections, communicate, and over the course of the four years, have you create a portfolio. If you put in the work to build connections and put out quality work, then it's definitely a unique opportunity that offers you more than just a degree.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ll be transferring from a CC in LA. I\u2019m applying locally but I\u2019ve recently visited Chico State and I loved it and my parents support me on going there. \n\nI want to know though if there\u2019s a lot of opportunities for students within this major? \n\nCSUN has a hospital close by and there\u2019s LAUSD where I can count on for school field hours. There will always be opportunities out here in LA. I just want to make sure I can have at least some type of opportunities out there in Chico as well. \n\nIf you\u2019re majoring in this major please reply! Thank you c:",

They are so kind and knowledgeable and I feel like they really care about the field and their students. In undergrad we just watch videos of SLPs working with clients for observation hours, but I\u2019m pretty sure they have lots of placements in grad school!",

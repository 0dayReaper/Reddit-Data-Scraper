I value both differently.\n\nAnd lastly, sure festivals are expensive but the shows at El Rey or Senator are like $20-30 and pretty lit most of the time (lots of people going to party favor).\n\nLike the other commenter said, college is what you make of it and in Chico there are pretty much no excuses to not having a fun, social time.",

I'm not into either of those, but my expectations were on par with reality and I had a great time. Out of 20+ classes I took over four semesters, less than half of them had more than 25 or so students.",

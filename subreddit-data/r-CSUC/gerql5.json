I built it up in my head into some magical place where I was gonna have all these great experiences. upon arrival it turns out it feels like any other school I've been too (I've studied at 2 community colleges and Poly) there wasn't really anything different about it. I expected students to be more collaborative or excited about school and they weren't. Most of my classmates still wait till the last minute to do projects and assignments, dick off in group work making it feel useless, and in general just don't feel anymore excited to learn than the other schools I've been too. Im an older transfer (30) and the school feels extremely young to me. It's funny that Chico has a reputation for being a party school because when I'm visiting my friend and wife up there it doesn't seem that way (besides frat row) while poly totally feels like a party school, my classmates constantly just talking about getting trashed etc etc. which is cool but I partied a decade ago and im over it. At community college I was always the guy that people came to for help and I was really excited to not be that person at poly with its reputation of being full of such smart students, turns out I'm still that person. Don't get me wrong, Poly is a great school but I don't think it lives up to the hype. For sure you get more hands on experience than at the UC's but those hands on experiences are available elsewhere too. People also talk about how abundant it is with opportunity and it is, but I wouldn't say more so than other places I've been or heard about. It really comes down to you and how engaged you're gonna be with the material and your professors. Theres opportunity everywhere if you're a hard worker and just ask. Beyond that, I'm from Socal and thought SLO would feel like a cultural change of pace, it doesn't, it might as well be LA north. It has this cult feeling where everyone here feels like they're better than other schools students since there at CAL POLY. My teachers constantly shit talk other schools and students and it just feels disrespectful and not true. The current administration here is hated and not student focused, spending money on baseball clubhouses and wine tasting rooms(a HUGE building). I guess my main point is that Cal Poly ain't nothing special IMO, its not a bad school it's just another school with a good reputation, and for sure Cal Poly grads like to hire Cal Poly grads but its not an end all be all situation. Also they make you jump through so many hoops in terms of pre requisite courses and it just feels like busy work, they try to pack so much into the quarter system and it feels excessive. They are understaffed, classes don't feel that small, the teachers aren't any better than my community college profs and in many of my classes they were much worse. \n\ntldr; the cost of living is expensive, it feels like a cult, I think it's running on the \"Learn by doing\" hype train rather than making its education more robust and relevant, feels like I still live in Socal, good education but I think you can get the same education elsewhere with a better overall experience.",

I just don\u2019t think its the right fit for everyone. At my CC it was the school all engineering majors wanted to go to, and as I mentioned I do think it is better than a UC for engineering in terms of the hands on nature of the school and many profs with lots of industry experience (not that I\u2019ve been to a UC but from what friends say about their time there). My point was just that I think theres a lot of hype around Cal Poly and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find that a handful of other CSU\u2019s have equally great engineering programs. I think the administration at Cal Poly has spent the last handful of years focusing on their image rather than their functionality. I also think ALL UC and CSU campuses don\u2019t do a good job with integrating their transfer students into the school, especially older transfer students, during orientations and what not it feels like were not even thought about, which makes sense since were a small minority generally speaking but still sucks. Ask me this time next year how I feel about it in comparison to CSU Chicos engineering program.",

You can take classes that specialize in data base, SAP, IT focused classes too. You have plenty of job opportunities after graduation. A lot of the big companies like chevron, target, Kpmg sometimes. We also have clubs for this program that will also bring in companies themselves, and sometimes a meet and greet each semester with some companies. The focus isn\u2019t in one area. You can choose what you want focus on with the electives you choose. For example, i\u2019m focusing on SAP database.",

I haven't lived there in over a year but I remember businesses opening during a semester only to shut down mid summer because they didn't account for almost zero business from May to August. \n\nI lived in Chico and did my Undergrad and Grad studies there for ~6 years and for the most part the issue is that the city doesn't support the college students enough. Tons of students love the town and want to stay, but have ways to actually transition into careers in the city. For a while it was thought that this would change since we secretly had Google in town but for some reason they left a few years back taking away the hope many students had.",

I had it mentioned to me multiple times by people who either worked there or who knew someone who did. They didn't call it Google and kept it a secret for some reason. But all the employees were aware that they were employed by google because I believe one of the things they did was customer service for google along with some other stuff.",

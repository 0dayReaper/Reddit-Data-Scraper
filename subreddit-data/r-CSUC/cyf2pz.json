What they do is against the rules but it's nothing remotely close to disrespectful, abusive or dangerous. I'm just paranoid and considering my options since they are nice people.\n\nHas anyone been through this and can give me the run down on what it entails?",

If you give the actual reason then your roommate will get in trouble, so I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s best to come up with a lie.",

There's definitely more reputation to that program, but I'd say that's if you were doing it in person. You'd probably do better as an in-person student here than as an online student at Colorado. \n\n\n\nWhat would you like to do, career-wise?\n\n\nEdit: just saw you want to do business/data analyst. There's a pretty good calling for that out of our MINS graduates. We've got a couple of our tenure-track professors trying to get more analytics courses off the ground, so it's a good time for that. Chico also offers a data science certificate.",

You get in-state tuition and you get the true \"college experience\" by attending school on-campus.  It's a win-win.\n\nYou will not regret moving to Chico.",

California State calls this \"non-resident\" tuition and fees. \n\nIt is fairly common for out-of-state costs to be about 2-3 times more than in-state costs.\n\nSo for the vast majority of people, you get *much, much* more value at an in-state public school. There are some special cases where it might be worth the money to go for more expensive colleges (such as out-of-state or private) such as if they offer you a very large scholarship or if you go to an elite school like Harvard that helps your professional networking more than most public schools.\n\nI'm not sure how things differ when it comes to online education. However, I will warn you that online education isn't as effective and misses out on a lot of opportunities (such as networking, being involved in extra-curricular activities, learning to live independently, etc) that you get with the traditional American college experience. I suspect those are particularly valuable if you're going into business since interpersonal and networking skills are so vital.\n\nBut I might be biased because I'm a Chico State professor.",

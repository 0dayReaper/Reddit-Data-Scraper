The reason why I'm asking this question is that I've heard some classes is used LINUX environment, so I'm thinking mac is not the right choice. Could you give me some advice?  Thank you.",

Text editing and compiling won't take many resources for the assignments you'll be doing. Many of the core programming classes recommend you work remotely on the jaguar server anyways. \n\nMy 5 year old ASUS has been able to carry me through the entire degree. (It was a year old model when I purchased it and it is worth noting that it can't run Windows10  without overheating, but I tossed Debian on it and its still going stronger than ever)",

If you have less than 8 GB of RAM, you will probably run into problems. I recommend 16 GB to be on the safe side of being future-proof for a few years.\n\nOperating system doesn't really matter. Most of our classes use a *nix development environment, but even if you're not running *nix, there are a variety of solutions. Both OSX and Windows 10 have the tools available to run *nix programs from the terminal/command line. You can also run virtual machines and the department gets free access to VMware software. You can also remote connect to our server with SSH.",

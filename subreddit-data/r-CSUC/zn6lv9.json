    "postText": "Due to costs, my kid will likely forgo enrollment in one of several larger, out-of-state dream schools and attend Chico, which better fits my budget and is only about three hours from home. I know it's a nice little town and a charming campus at the base of the beautiful Sierra. All good. But beyond that, what's there to say? Is there anything unique going on? Any music or art scene? Any noteworthy faculty or students doing anything interesting that puts this school on the map? Would someone who was eyeing bigger, more traditional non-California schools find it fulfilling?",

Besides that, it is a beautiful campus. Your kid will have a great time if he or she finds good community there and be surrounded by great influences of people. The farmers market are very enjoyable, and downtown is super lively during the semesters. Overall, a great town but there is sort of a weird thing going on with the CSU system and the rights for employees and students at Chico State. Just Listen to your gut, always. A parent knows best.",

If they're looking for that college movie experience of going to frat parties and hanging out and making friends, I can't really speak to that (obviously graduated a while ago, and that was never something I had time for in college). If they're looking to get into the nursing program, or to study anthropology (check out our [Human Identification Lab](https://www.csuchico.edu/hil/), it's pretty impressive for a middle-of-nowhere school), we have good programs for those things. I've heard good things about computer science as well, with several local companies available for internships and often hiring right out of the program. \n\nSo... as someone who took a somewhat non-traditional route through school, had a relatively boring time in college, and does nothing with her degree, I feel like college is what you make of it. It's tough to draw big names for anything up here, two hours north of Sacramento, but if your kid is into something the school *is* known for... they could end up having a good experience here. \n\nAlso as someone who turned down the more traditional liberal arts schools back east and ended up here, and who is now a parent herself... the \"in my budget\" part is SO important. If your child can graduate with minimal to no student loans, vs. the family being saddled with debt for an out-of-state option... that's a HUGE leg up in the long run from a financial and even emotional security standpoint, and I don't think that can be ignored in one's consideration. Tuition is going to be less expensive here than out of state, for sure, but also housing costs here vs. at UC Davis or someplace in the Bay.",

I went to University of California of Irvine for two years, and took on $10,000 debt while there. I transferred to Chico because it was more affordable, and the only difference in my education now is that my classes are smaller, more intimate, and professors actually have time to talk to me. I went from class sizes of 300 at Irvine to 30 at Chico. I am a computer science major and with only Chico on my resume, after removing all traces of UCI to avoid questions about my transfer during the interview,  I received internship offers from two major tech companies.\n\nMy friend went out of state for his degree in journalism and is now $80,000 dollars in debt from a top school. He's expecting to have it paid off in 10-15 years from now. I plan to have my debt erased 1-3 years from graduation. And speaking of debt, I will only be paying the $10,000 I owe from Irvine because Chico is affordable enough for me to just pay my tuition each semester up front.\n\nI'm a slightly older student, since I took some time off between my transfer from Irvine to Chico. A lot of these kids replying are young and don't know better. With time it becomes much easier to see above the university bubble our country's academic system perpetuates. When you have a job all that matters is the debt you're carrying with you, nobody cares about what school you're from.",

            "comment": "What I would tell any person thinking of picking a CSU. There is a reason it is cheap. I am not saying it is bad, not by a long shot. It is one of the best values to get a degree. But seriously, don't expect world class anything (teaching, research, or facilities) on a shoestring budget with a top heavy administration and especially if the program you are considering has &gt;50% part-time lecturers (meaning the college doesn't invest in itself).\n\nApproach this the same way you are buying a $7,000 used car compared to a $45,000 car. One is going to be better and provide a better experience although both will get you from point A to point B (hopefully without breaking down).",

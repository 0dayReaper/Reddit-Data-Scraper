    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI have some questions about the requirements for Computer Science majors to transfer to CSU Chico. The main one being, is the Physics series required before transferring, or is it possible to take it at Chico?\n\nFurthermore, I have some questions about the specific languages that are used in the CSCI program? Since, at my CC, we've been taught in exclusively C++; should I learn anything before transferring out?",

For figuring out which classes might transfer over, [Assist.org](assist.org) can look up the corresponding transfer credit for your particular community college.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, I have some questions about the specific languages that are used in the CSCI program? Since, at my CC, we've been taught in exclusively C++; should I learn anything before transferring out?\n\nOur programming sequence (111-211-311, which cover programming, data structures, and algorithms) uses C++. Upper-division classes will get you exposure to other languages as well, but a solid foundation in C++ will help you *learn how to learn* other languages.",

BUT... you are more likely to be accepted if you have completed a significant portion of the major's lower-division courses also.  Because if you don't have these done by the time you transfer in as a junior, you're going to be way behind.",

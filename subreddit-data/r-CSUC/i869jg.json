    "postText": "Hey everyone, I know that we are all enjoying our last few days of summer before classes start online but I wanted to be sure all of you who are taking Computer Animation and Game Development are aware of a few things you may want to find right now so you will be ahead of the curb! I don't remember if they tell you about some of this stuff but as a transfer I wish I knew about the following:\n\nFirstly ensure you have a reasonably up to date computer, programs you will be using mosting commonly include Autodesk Maya, Photoshop and Unity. If you are having issues with your machine running one or more of them now is a great time to see if someone you know has a computer you can upgrade to, borrow or utilize for classes! Alternatively you can just buy one too, the school will tell you what specs you specifically need, but ensuring its all up to date with the newest drivers never hurts in any case.\n\nFor anyone doing any form of computer based art (even non CAGD students) taking 110-Computer assisted art. Do your self a favor and pick up a Wacom tablet. If your doing the animation side, you may want a fancy one but for the rest of us I suggest one of these bad boys: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079HL9YSF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_9O1mFbTGTSY6C\n\nThey are pretty solid and way better than attempting to use your mouse like a Neanderthal. Of course if you have experience with mouse drawing then you do you. On a side note if you hold onto it and don't need it you can always try to set up an incoming freshman with one next semester and make some money from it.\n\nThese last few items are general working at home on the computer recommendations that I think you should have to help maintain a productive work flow. In CAGD if you do not utilize your free time well everything gets behind and they do NOT accept late work!\n\nExtra stuff on or for your computer work space:\n- some sort of favorite mug, cup or water bottle. If you are bored then hydrate, if your busy then hydrate. It is key to being healthy\n- if you use a laptop then find some sort of stand or spacer for it, you dont want all that heat building up so propping it on something will give it airflow and help keep the temp down. Amazon has these also\n- proper support for your back and neck are important, your going to be working on the computer for HOURS at a time so find somethung very comfy to sit on that supports you. Again amazon has some solutions to help turn table chairs into slightly more comfy chairs\n- music, so much music. I don't care if you listen to the same song for 10 hours in a loop, just have something that your brain associates with working on schoolwork to listen to. I personally listen to a long loop of the potion shop theme from the Legend of Zelda\n- discord. Its a program we use alot, odds are if you are here you already use it. My advice is have a personal discord uou can invite friends to so you can make jokes and share memes without pestering the instructors too much. Also set it up so that you can use programs without discoed snitching on you. Last thing you want is a teacher who can SEE your running minecraft during class\n- people. This is going to sound weird but pick at least 1 person that you see in your courses to show your work to. Not to brag about but to ask for advice, sometimes we have group stuff and that helps but no one in our major is great at everything. Find someone who shares work that makes you say \"Damn thats good\" and ask them to look your work over. Alot of you are in the same boat of having 0 experience with this and having a group of friends to bounce ideas off of makes the work pass by faster AND helps you remember all the different things the teacher wants you to try on your work. As an added bonus these friends can also be put into that discord we mentioned earlier! \n\nI know this is a long read and I have NO idea how useful it will be but I wished I had something like this when I was starting off here. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.\n\n For you and everyone else of this subreddit: Goodluck team, I believe in you! Have a good semester!",

I am a transfer and I have no idea what most of the students go through because I am just doing degree classes and upper GE. That being said helping people is fun and I encourage you to adapt what I have brought up to your department!",

Probably cause Im was an Art major for my AA and so I have to be able to draw directly on whatever my canvas is.\n\nAlso, as for specs my desktop has, Asus Rog Strix B550 mobo, amd ryzen 3600 cpu, msi rtx2060 gpu, and 32gb of ram.",

I would just say find some sanitizing wipes or equivalent before you head up here as there isn't really any that I can find easily in the Chico area.",

Ask your professors about it for more info. \n\nAlso, less important BUT... try to grab an extra monitor at some point if you don't have one, I'm telling ya with the programs you'll be using you're never truly productive with just one",

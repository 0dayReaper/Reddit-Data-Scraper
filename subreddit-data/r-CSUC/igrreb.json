Be it pneumonia, mono, or COVID.  \n\nTalk with the health center first to get a medical diagnosis, and then contact the ARC to have them advocate for you to get the accommodations you may need. I hope you feel better soon. Facing illness or injury is a part of life that we are rarely confronted with and can be daunting. \n\nWhile you are still feeling ill, reach out to your professors to let them know your plan of action regarding official medical diagnosis and ARC accommodations. \n\nThat being said, you will still be expected to complete  the work assigned to you in order to receive credit. Illness and injury may be a valid reason to push back deadlines, if done in a proactive and professional manner. But at the end of the day you will still be expected to grasp the material and do the same amount of work as your classmates.",

I'm at the tail end of the math program so instead of using stuff how we're told to use it we instead have to prove that it works so we can use it... which requires a lot of knowledge that isn't guaranteed to be built in prior classes, so you end up having to study beyond what's covered in the text or lecture. Textbooks are pretty hit or miss when it comes to building the necessary understanding - a lot of it \"leaves the exercise to the reader\" so you're SOL if that's where you needed help.",

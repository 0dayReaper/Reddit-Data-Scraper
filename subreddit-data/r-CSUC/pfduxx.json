I picked marketing on my mom\u2019s advice because I thought it would be the actual ad campaign / ad copy / slogan stuff I\u2019ve seen her do professionally and\u2026 it hasn\u2019t been.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has advice about the degree program! Thanks :)",

Choose something you wanna do, fail, then maybe settle. I had the same mindset when I started art. It might take years before you make any income, but it\u2019s better than making brochures for American Airlines for the 30th time. Think about what you wanna do.",

They changed the program after I graduated and now you'll get a BFA in Communication Design.\n\nYeah, Frank and Barbara run the upper-division design classes. They're both realistic about the design profession in the real world and (in my opinion) don't try to sugarcoat anything to you. But they're pretty nice if you have a good attitude and get all your projects done on time. Your projects will be super similar to your peers'/people in your cohort post-portfolio review, so I highly recommend finding internships either on or off-campus to diversify your portfolio.",

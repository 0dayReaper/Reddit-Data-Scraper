As a student you get a free bus pass using your student ID. Liked that there was no hectic traffic. Downtown is right next to campus which is a bonus. I recommend going there. I miss living in Chico lol. Lmk if you have any questions about Chico.",

Or you live in the greater LA/SD/Bay Area in a more suburban setting? \n\nChico is a very walkable, bikeable, and compact town (unlike most big city suburbs). You'll have everything you need within a 15 minute walk or short drive. In some ways, it feels more lively and city-like than the greater suburban areas just outside of the big cities.",

Well it either doesn't exist anywhere nearby, or it is very nearby in Chico. You can reasonably expect to bike anywhere if you want to.",

I\u2019m not sure if parties will happen either. I mean if one person has covid and goes to any type of party it could honestly be detrimental, but i guess it depends on what the current situation/cases there are. On the other hand, it\u2019s much harder to make friends online, and it\u2019s easier to get to know people when you\u2019re actually in chico. I would consider what are the pros and cons are for staying home, and then see if it\u2019s worth moving into the dorms or not.",

            "comment": "The dorm life this Fall is going to be regulated with new guidelines and procedures to keep everyone safe, so it\u2019s definitely not going to be a usual experience. Gayle released a statement saying dorms will be single occupancy, but students will have to pay double occupancy rates, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s not worth it. I recommend joining \u201cChico Student Housing 2020-2021 Roommate Search\u201d on Facebook if you\u2019re desperately wanting to move here for the Fall semester. There are plenty of people looking to fill rooms or go in on leases with others, and it\u2019s a much cheaper alternative. Plus, you can socialize with your roommates, and they can introduce you to people as well. \n\nRegarding parties, there may be some, but nothing crazy like usual. A lot of students are taking this opportunity to stay home and save money, so Chico is not going to be as populated with students. Some of my friends have gone to parties recently and they mentioned they weren\u2019t great enough to take the risk again.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I recently got admitted to chico state for fall 2023 (easiest admission ever lmao I had a 2.7 gpa in hs). I graduated in 22. Took a \u201cgap year\u201d .I was just wondering if you think I\u2019ll be able to survive living in an apartment my first year as a freshman. I have a friend who is currently a freshman at chico state living in a dorm so I would plan on getting an apartment with him and his current dorm mate. (maybe a 4th roommate will be needed depending on pricing. I\u2019ve heard getting an apartment is way cheaper than living in the dorms and honestly that\u2019s very important to me. (saving money if possible) My budget on rent would probably be around $600 or less and I would probably need to get a part time job  there as well. So my main concern is the school/ work life balance, Will i be able to manage living off campus my first year and finding a job there. I am moving from san diego so cal area. Also ideally I would want to find a apartment that\u2019s close enough to campus for me to either walk or bike. I\u2019ve heard parking is a pain on campus so It\u2019d be chill just to leave my car at the apartment and walk to class. If you have any advice on my situation let me know. As well as any apartment recommendations.",

Not exactly Aladdin's magic palace, but it's decent.  The landlord and other managers are also very nice, and repair requests are always taken care of very quickly.  Good luck and I hope you enjoy Chico.",

Once things cooled off, bills went down to $7-20/month -- granted, we never used the heater even once.\n\nWe also signed up for some kind of discount for low-income people.  This month there's a climate credit so our bill is actually negative: -$56 \n\nThis is with the \"Tiered Rate E-1\" plan, so I'm not sure how much good that's doing.",

I recommend going to csuchico.edu and then you can use their website for off campus resources. Pomona west, the urban, and csuliving communities are all what I\u2019m looking at.",

It would only cost you about $500-700 a month. But remember you also gotta pay for your own electricity and internet. You also could qualify for cal fresh which would give you about $200 a month for groceries for yourself (check online for the qualifications) \n\nBut everyone that I know who has lived in the dorms (I never did , always lived off campus) has hated it. You also get more freedom to do what you wan tin your own place compared to a dorm",

I\u2019m pretty social and felt I could meet people and make friends other than by living in the dorms. My Freshman year I rushed a fraternity, joined the wakeboard (waterski) team and was a founder of the snowboard club. Suffice to say that my social calendar was full.\n\nThere are a lot of 3&amp;4 bedroom houses/apartments well within bike range of campus. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have difficulty finding something in your budget.",

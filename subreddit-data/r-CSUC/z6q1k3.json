    "postText": "I'm currently making a pros and cons list for the colleges I want to attend. I've already been accepted to Chico and qualify for the honors program (idk Abt doing it yet). So I decided to start on a list early. But for the life of me, I can't find any clubs. I can see all the very professional looking clubs that work with promoting the school and doing community like things. But hear me out, is there a list of clubs that focus on personal interests? Simple clubs that focus on making friends and doing certain things. Like a soccer club, or a d&amp;d club, smaller scale things like that? If so, someone please send me a list or link. Chico looks really good for me but I'm worried about opportunities to reach out and make friends. So please, if there are any personal interest type clubs I'd love to know!",

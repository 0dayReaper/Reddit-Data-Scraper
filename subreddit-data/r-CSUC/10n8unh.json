This is my LAST semester and then I get my associates degree\u2026 I was told I need to apply for universities now, so which I did..\n\nBut now I\u2019m getting an email that I need to send my official transcripts by March 1st!!\n\nDoes this mean I\u2019ll have to wait since my semester isn\u2019t done until May??",

It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask your current school for those transcripts.\n\nThen, Chico can then offer you a conditional acceptance letter for which they could always rescind if you were to fail said classes in progress (or get arrested, fail to meet other criteria, etc.)",

            "comment": "So you get your official transcripts from your CC and what it shows is the classes you\u2019ve taken and the classes that you are currently in \u201cin progress\u201d and then at the end of the spring semester after your final grades are posted in your transcript you send them another one. It\u2019s so they can verify transferable credits and so they cans verify the unit amount you\u2019ve taken. It also helps them once you transfer it\u2019ll make it easier for an advisor to see which classes you need and don\u2019t need.\n\nAlso after the spring semester the transcript should show you earned an AA/T and because of that once you transfer to csuc it waives a couple class req you would otherwise have to take if you weren\u2019t transferring in with an as/t or aa/t . Like for me (I\u2019m a fall 2021 transfer with an AS/T from a CC). I was able to get a writing requirement waived since I took two English classes as part of my A-G requirements even though the second English class didnt show up as transferable. \n\nOnce you get to csuc, talk to grad advising and talk to your advisors and get the best academic plan down for you . \n\nHope this helped (:",

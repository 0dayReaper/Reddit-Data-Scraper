I wasn\u2019t able to receive any financial aid this semester and now need to cover the cost of my tuition of $4000. Any amount of donation is very much appreciated and it would mean the world to me if you could either donate or share so that I may have a chance at continuing the semester instead of taking a gap year. Thank you so much in advance!\n\n[Help with college tuition](https://gofund.me/087b7fd9)",

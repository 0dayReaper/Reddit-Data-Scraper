He got a free room, large meal plan, and a part time job (manning the front desk).",

University Village seems appealing since it should be full of transfers, plus the benefit of the university housing you with whatever groups you deigned to like, like housing you with other honors students or the lavender thing for lgbt students. Too everything is closed down right now otherwise I would have a visit to the apartments. But if things continue on like this, it lools like the dorns are gonna be the safest gaurentee.",

            "comment": "It's significantly cheaper to live in apartments. I think the major advantage for a dorm is if you don't want the hassle of having to pay for bills like utilities, you want roommates to be decided for you, and you're afraid to live on your own in terms of responsibilities\n\nI don't regret moving into the dorms in my first year because I met my best friends that way, but I also fucking hated the dorms and cursed them everyday. Couldn't drink beer without sneaking them in, couldn't smoke weed without the window closed. That being said I lived in UV, in the transfer section, where none of the RAs gave a shit enough to inspect us. So I had the most relaxing time out of anybody, and I still hated it. Also laundry rooms are terrible.\n\nIf you have more specific questions feel free to PM me, I was living in UV until the Corona virus",

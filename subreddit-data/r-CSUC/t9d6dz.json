But, there are some super racist clowns in the surrounding towns, but that's true of any rural area in California.",

Academic institutions are already not designed to support the BIPOC community and when shit happens (a professors car was vandalized with something racist a few weeks ago) all they do is send an email about it. Chico pushed to become a Hispanic serving institution and then had border patrol and ice show up to the career fair. \n\nIdk, I did my undergrad at chico and now I\u2019m halfway through a masters program. If I hadn\u2019t met my partner I would have moved out of Chico and done my master\u2019s in the Bay. \n\nMy advice, find a community within Chico that you get along with and pick up a mentor or two. Some of my bigger problems were solved because I vented to a professor and they gave me advice I would have never come across my own as a FGCS. Best of luck with your choice!",

I remember hearing some casual racist \"jokes\" on campus when I was still a student. That being said, my friends who are of color have told me they haven't faced much outright harassment after years of living here or felt concerned for their safety.",

W\\*tback, Sp\\*c, told to go back to Mexico, speak English. You'll sometimes see a moron riding around with a Confederate flag. The other day I saw two morons get into a parking dispute and he started screaming a bunch of racial slurs.\n\nEvery community has its morons. Unfortunately, racism and other forms of bigotry seem to exist everywhere. Some places are probably worse then others.\n\nHopefully that helps.",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm a student currently enrolled in physics 202A at Chico State and was wondering if you could get a D in Physics 202A and still pass if your not going on to the next level. Im geology major and my advisor hasn't gotten back to me about weather I would be able to pass with this grade. If there is a place online where I could figure this out, I would appreciate any direction.",

I chose a different instructor and got a B+. Please don't be too hard on yourself. Sometimes it just takes a couple of passes through the material, or a different instructor if that is a possibility.",

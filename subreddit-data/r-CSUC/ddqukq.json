Transfers are usually restricted to University Village which is about $4k a semester, and off-campus housing is generally cheaper with roommates. There are several Facebook groups that are now starting to be filled with Spring listings.",

On campus study rooms. No bills. Always quiet, so party off campus and always have a calm home\nSchool repairs everything\n\nNegatives\n\nCold water\nSmall kitchen\nGet charged for losing keys\nExpensive compared to apartments\nyou can't openly smoke or drink (my ra doesn't police us as long as we are low-key, ie sneak beers in)\nFar away from bars\nNo animals :/",

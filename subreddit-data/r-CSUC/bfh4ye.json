In other universities you can choose an unlimited meal plan but with Chico you get a limited amount of meals a semester with flex cash. With the Chico Plan you can eat for 4 days out 7 a week and get $64. Can you actually by enough food with that amount for the other 3 days a week the entire semester?",

Then you get as much food as you want from the different stations in the dining hall.\n\nSo you have a limited number of meals, but each meal is unlimited food.  I'm sure if you start getting low, you can buy more swipes, but most residents end up with leftover swipes at the end of the semester.",

            "comment": "The Chico plan (64 meals a semester) is usually designed for students in Konkow or University village because those dorms come with a full kitchen and fridge. So they expect you to be able to go buy groceries and cook which is honestly cheaper than meal plans. You can get the normal plan most students get which is around 120 for the semester but students usually get burnt out and stop using them leaving them with a lot of swipes. A swipe is worth about 10 dollars so unless you're sure you can use them all, it's best to get a smaller plan especially if you live in Konkow or UV",

The Chico plan is most popular with university village residents, who have kitchens and are much closer to Safeway than the other dorms. It\u2019s expected they\u2019d do a lot of their eating at home. If you\u2019re living on main campus, get one of the bigger plans.",

            "comment": "Okay alot of people have given you some pretty good info here's my experience. I have the meal plan with the most amount of swipes and least amount of flex cash.  If you are worried about not having enough swipes for the whole semester you underestimate how often you will be eating out. The food in the dining hall is a 7/10 at best and there are only a few different types of food that are consistently okay. Eventually, you grow tired of that and start going out with friends. Considering your class schedule you will probably use 2 swipes a day in the dining hall at max which in theory is 14 a week when you should be budgeting for 12 swipes a week. Again this doesn't take into account how often you'll be eating out.  Last semester i had over 30 unused swipes and this semester im close to using all of them because i swipe in my friends who live off campus alot.",

Since each swipe is all-you-can-eat, you can get pretty full and won\u2019t necessarily always go for 3 daily meals. Also, the dining hall mainly serves the same food all year so it gets kind of boring to eat eventually (at least with my experience), and i started going less and less towards the end of the year anyways, choosing instead buy some groceries and lots of snacks. I rarely meet people who have full meal plans (as in not the mini ones from UV) that run out of swipes, but if you find yourself to be one of those people who somehow drains their swipes, i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a friend who\u2019s willing to swipe you in to eat. \n\nFlexcash is really great for getting \u201cfree\u201d meals outside of the dining hall once in a while, because the BMU (Bell Memorial Union) has a dining area that sells food during lunch hours that i personally think tastes better than the dining hall. Flexcash also can be used for the cafes on campus, or Butte Station, which is a convenience store on campus.",

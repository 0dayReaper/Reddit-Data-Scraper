There are definitely country people here, but I would say Chico\u2019s a mix of like 50/50 or 60/40 Urban to Rural students. \n\nChico isn\u2019t super liberal or super conservative, in my four years here it\u2019s always been pretty moderate. \n\nThe student population is mostly White, followed second by Hispanic, then Asian, then Black. \n\nFraternities here are probably better than anywhere else, although if you\u2019re just looking to party then you\u2019re gonna either need to make friends with lots of girls or rush and pledge a fraternity and try to actually make it. \n\nHope this helped!",

That being said it is on the milder side of college campus politics. Most students just want to do their work and have their fun.\n(That isn't to say its apolitical--just not well known for being super activist.)",

Regardless of what way you lean towards, as long as you\u2019re chill, most students are always down to make new friends.",

They definitely seem to lean left but are all level handed and it rarely comes up. I have definitely had pretty conservative people and pretty liberal people and also several lefties. I think you'll expose yourself to lots of diffrent perspectives if you involve yourself. That's what Uni is all about",

It\u2019s fine to befriend extroverts but one of my best friends from college is an introvert just like me. One of the great aspects of our friendship is when we\u2019re done hanging out because we\u2019re tired or drained or whatever, neither one of us has a problem or takes it personally when the other wants to call it a day. \n\nSo befriending introverts is just fine. \n\nIn terms of how to do that, research the different clubs and see if there\u2019s one relevant to you that you\u2019d like to join. They can be fun atmospheres to get to know people in but most of them are low stress environments that don\u2019t demand much. \n\nSometimes group projects are also good opportunities to get to know classmates, that\u2019s how I got to know my buddy better originally. Now we\u2019re out of school and we hang out at least once a week. It\u2019s rad.",

I signed up for a couple and I can post some of the times for their first meeting as a comment on here once they give me the times\n\nI\u2019m a transfer student and this is my first year. I\u2019m having the same problem but I went around and started asking about some of he clubs that interested me and everyone was really nice. \n\nOne place I heard of is called the hub, it\u2019s a great place to study and meet people. They always have fun events and there\u2019s plenty of people there. They had an karoake night from 10-2am Friday but I couldn\u2019t attend because I commute to school. \n\nBesides clubs, and checking out the hub. I would try talking to some of your class mates or anyone that shares your major. Study buddies are great friends.",

It could be dota 2 or the adventure outings. It literally does not matter what you do just join a club or a sport, you instantly have friends because you will have 1. People to relate to 2. People who want to be around you and 3. A reason to get out of the house",

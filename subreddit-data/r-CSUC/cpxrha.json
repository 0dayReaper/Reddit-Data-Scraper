    "postText": "Are the used books at the wildcat store in good condition? I need to buy Scientific Farm Animal Production 11th edition and the used is $50 cheaper but says it might be missing CDs or supplemental materials.\n\nCan anyone with experience buying new/used books shed some light? What do you recommend?\n\nAlso, if I buy them through the link they emailed can I pick them up at the store after I move in next week or do they mail them to you?\n\nThanks!!",

I haven't bought more than one book a semester. If they need connect or cnow access codes or anything you have to buy them new. \n\n\nThat said, chegg or Amazon will almost always be cheaper. Don't worry about keeping the book, you'll never open it again",

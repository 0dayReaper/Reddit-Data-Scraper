This photo competition is looking for photos taken by college students ([https://www.boomcontest.com/](https://www.boomcontest.com/))! They are giving $500 away to the first prize winner and $125 for four runner ups and it doesn't cost anything to submit. The photos they are looking for are just of your everyday life (you don't need to have a fancy camera or be an art major to fit the vibe of the contest).",

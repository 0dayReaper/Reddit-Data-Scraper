    "postText": "I going to be a freshman at CSUC next year, and I was wondering what people thought about the first year calc. I\u2019m majoring in Mechatronics, so it\u2019s really calc heavy. Since I haven\u2019t taken the AP exam yet, I obviously don\u2019t know my score yet. That being said, I was wondering whether people skipped out on first year calc, and whether it was worth it. I\u2019ve heard from some of my teachers that you generally don\u2019t want to skip a class, because they may expect you to know things that you haven\u2019t been taught before. What do you guys think?",

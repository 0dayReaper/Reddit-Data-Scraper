Whitney has 9 floors (8 for rooms) and Sutter has 5 (4 for rooms).\n\nWhitney Pros:\n- Easy to meet other people\n- Large lounge space on bottom floor\n\nWhitney Cons:\n- Very loud especially with poor walls\n- Nowhere near as clean or nice as Sutter\n\nSutter Pros:\n- Very quiet space, nice for studying\n- Newest building, very clean and best facilities\n\nSutter Cons:\n- Not as easy to meet other people\n- Most expensive dorm",

Sutter is nicer but super quiet. I honestly didn\u2019t think Whitney was that bad regarding being hella gross it\u2019s a college dorm so you can\u2019t have that high of expectations and all of the shitty things about it just became super funny memories w my friends.",

    "postText": "Did any of your Spring 2021 classes change from synchronous to completely asynchronous before classes started? Or did your professor decide to convert some synchronous zoom lessons to pre-recoded lessons after classes started? \n\nThis came up during the recent State of the University\u2019s zoom meeting and the Dean of Undergraduate Education was surprised the hear this happened. She wants to know which classes this occurred in so she can share with administration, because teachers can\u2019t do that at their discretion as shown here [screenshot ] (https://imgur.com/gallery/1ylZuSD)\n\nIf you could please email her: KMcCarthy@csuchico.edu\n\nProvide the course name and number, teacher name, date changes happened if you remember, and a simple description (Ex: \u201cregistered for class as M/W/F 10-11:50, became asynchronous over the holidays\u201d)\n\nThanks for helping out!",

    "postText": "as the title says I may attend in the Fall (as a transfer student from community college) but I\u2019d like some insight if anyone has any please. I got accepted into the Food &amp; Nutrition Communication program, but am interested in Public Health, or maybe Community Health Education. (not sure what I want to pursue yet, but maybe thinking Public Policy)? I\u2019m wondering if anyone in either area has insight what it was/what it\u2019s like for them? thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Hey!\n\nMasters Student here in Nutrition Education at Chico State. I also did my undergrad at Chico State and graduated in 2018. I've taken a couple of upper division public health courses, but I don't really feel I can comfortably assess the program. As for the Nutrition program here I love it. Depending on what you want to do within the program (dietetics, communication, management) it can be very difficult. I graduated with my degree in nutrition communication so I avoided some of the dietetics classes, but now I have to take them for my current program, and they are pretty difficult. \n\nWhat I can say about the program is the people and especially the professors actually give a shit. I didn't actually talk to my professors until my senior year and they were the reason I gave graduate school a go. Now, I talk to a lot of them on a somewhat regular basis and they can really help guide you. Whether with after school plans, or internship/job opportunities, or class help, they can help out a lot. The classes are manageable, but again, depending on the option you choose, these classes can become overwhelming. There are a couple of nutrition clubs on campus that make it pretty easy to network or make friends. I do know some people who had problems with the program, but that mostly had to do with the school itself and less with the classes. If you're commuting, it can really mess with the Chico experience. \n\nHopefully that can answer some questions. If you have specific questions about professors or classes, I can definitely answer those as well. But one thing I can say comfortably is that, you really have to enjoy what you are studying. I was undeclared for my first 3 semesters so I understand some ambivalence about what program you want to go into. But once, I decided on my major, it was really smooth sailing from there.",

                            "comment": "Sure! Once you get past some of the basic concepts and physiology of nutrition, you get to learn how to effectively communicate it.\n\nClasses that really focus on the Communication aspect are classes like Nutrition and Physical Fitness, Nutrition throughout the Lifecyle, Nutrition and Disease, Diets Supplements and Functional Foods, Health at Every Size, Nutrition Counseling, Community Nutrition and Cultural Foods. These are classes I had to take as a Nutrition Communication major. They were really interesting and helped me out as far as outpatient nutrition counseling and community nutrition.\n\nI'd also like to mention that there are internships and paid positions at CHC, and work opportunities at the Food Pantry on Campus to get you acquainted with some of the aspects of community nutrition.  On top of that, there are externships that are required (one unit courses that professors offer) where you're assigned projects. My senior externship required us to go to Chico High give presentations, and facilitate a final project for seniors in a nutrition class. The reason I bring that up, is that I didn't see teaching nutrition as an option until that externship. Now, it is something that I will seriously consider after my dietetic internship. Who knows what it could be for you. I had a classmate finish her masters in nutrition education with every intention of becoming a dietitian like I want. Instead, she took a grant writing course offered in Public Health Administration and is working for a non profit now. There are a lot of times in these fields where you are going to change your mind and that is okay. I have friends who did their undergrad in nutrition and now do their masters in public health admin and vice/versa.\n\nI can answer specific questions about some of the courses, but honestly I forget. It's been 3-5 years for most of these classes. I think most importantly, these courses just give us the tools to effectively communicate an answer to people about nutrition. I think I left with more questions than answers after I initially graduated. But I digress, let me know if you have any other questions. Even if you don't pursue it at Chico State, I can help out as much as I can because I've definitely been in your shoes before.",

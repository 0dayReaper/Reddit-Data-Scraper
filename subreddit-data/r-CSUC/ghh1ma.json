    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m graduating 2021 from high school and I have CSUC in mind! But I\u2019m not sure if I have a chance of getting in; stats aren\u2019t that outstanding.. was not that involved throughout high school but am planning to be more involved my senior year though it is probably too late, I took honor classes freshman/sophomore year and junior year I\u2019m only taking 1 AP class. My cumulative GPA is 3.3 (weighed)... sophomore year I didn\u2019t do too well (3 C\u2019s) but I\u2019m trying to bounce back as my first semester of junior year I got a 3.8 weighed gpa/3.6UW.. Being in quarantine I\u2019ve been stressing that I won\u2019t be able to get into any school that I have in mind because my stats are honestly, not good. I feel like I have no chance to get into a decent school; I\u2019m probably just overthinking it but looking at other people\u2019s stat\u2019s and them complaining about their 3.9 or 4.1 does not really help",

            "comment": "With a 3.3 cumulative you'll likely be fine. Make sure you do at least decent on the SAT's and you're golden. The CSU in general isn't as demanding of a weighted GPA nearing 4.7 or anything crazy. Though maybe Cal Poly Slo would want around 4.0 with at least 2000 SAT. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f you can take a look at admissions pages and even call the offices of admissions for different schools to ask questions like this, that way you're not hoping for a subjective answer that may or may not be right.",

Prep books at least. I would think around a 1600 will getcha in good.\n\nAs for extracurriculars, you can try and find places near you to volunteer. It looks good on apps and its also a good thing to do.\n\nPush comes to shove you go to community college. Butre Community is pretty good here in Chico, and directly leads into CSU, Chico once you get you Associates degree.\n\nEither way,now is the time to start planning.",

I graduated high school with around a 3.3 GPA as well because I screwed around my freshman year in high school and ended the year with Ds and Cs. After that year I kicked my butt into gear and started to get better grades. Not once did I do any extra curricular activities outside of school and I was not in any sort of clubs but I still got accepted to Chico State and received my degree in computer science pretty easily.\n\nI think your chances are pretty good OP.",

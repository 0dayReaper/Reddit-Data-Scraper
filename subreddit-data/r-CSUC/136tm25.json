I play lacrosse and love music, some of my favorite artists being Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, Lana Del Rey, The 1975, and Harry Styles. I love the beach, going to concerts/going out in general, and traveling. \n\nI plan on joining the lacrosse team at Chico. I\u2019m tidy, quiet, but a light sleeper. \n\nFeel free to message me!!",

I can\u2019t tell (jk, jk, I\u2019m just playing around), best of luck on your roommate search. Considering using the Chico roommate Facebook group too if you haven\u2019t already, and keep in mind there are some apartments, like the Redwood Cove, that provide you with randomly selected roommates.",

There is one class I have no idea what is going on, and i have an open slot next semester to take the class. How do I drop a class?",

This change extends the drop date by a total of 11 weeks\u2014from week four to 15. This change differs from the spring 2020 policy adjustment that required instructor, chair and dean approvals. \n&gt; None of the other grading changes that were effective in spring 2020 will be enacted for the fall semester.\n&gt;\n&gt; Students wishing to request a modification to their classes for fall 2020 should complete an Add/Drop request (PDF)form and submit their completed form to registrar@csuchico.edu. \n&gt;\n&gt; Academic Policies and Regulations, including information on grading, credit/no credit and requirements can be found in the University Catalog.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Please contact the University Registrar by phone at (530) 898-5142 or email to registrar@csuchico.edu with questions.",

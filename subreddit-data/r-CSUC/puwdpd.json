            "comment": "Per semester:\n\n* full time tuition is ~$2,850.\n* student fees ~ $1,050\n\nAssuming you aren\u2019t in a dorm, and have no meal plan, your total cost per semester is ~$3,900\n\nFinancial aid is dependent on you/your parents income status. Let\u2019s assume you are poor and get the most financial aid:\n\n* Federal Pell Grant ~$3,400\n\n* State University Grant ~2,850\n\n* Federal Work Study ~$1,500\n\n\nNotice that the State University Grant is the same as tuition costs. That\u2019s because that grant would be automatically applied to tuition cost and you would never see the money. \n\nSo in this scenario, assuming you have no other fees owed to the school, live off campus,  get maximize Fasfa, and have no scholarships, and have no other form of financial support. \n\nYou could be expecting ~$2,350 remaining from your aid after paying the school. \n\nIf you spread that over 6 months (which is basically the start of fall semester to the start of spring semester) then you would be looking at a budget of about ~$390/month. \n\nThat\u2019s where the work study comes in you can get a job on campus, for example working at the WREC(school gym). I don\u2019t know of that can extend into the intersession time, but let\u2019s divide that $1,500 by 6 anyways, which leaves 250/month. \n\nYou can probably find a single room in a shared house, or even a shared room, for $500 or less. There are always students looking for roommates. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s $500. So you would have about $140/month net income for the year. \n\nYou would probably have to sell your car if you have one, but Chico is small so you can bike to and from Campus and pretty much anywhere else you need too. And there is a bus service. Its not the greatest, but its there. \n\n $140/month is doable for one person to eat on. Just shop smartly; buy lots of staples like beans, rice, corn, etc... and avoid eating out. \n\n\nThese are all rough estimates using assumptions based off my financial aid and income this semester. But I hope it gives you a decent idea.",

            "comment": "I think it would be best to make a budgeting list for yourself and see what you could afford. Apartments in the area range from 300-700 a room. It depends how nice, how many roommates, and how close you want to live to campus. I pay 550 for my room with one roommate, last place was 300 with 4, and it's fairly decent with only a 8 minute walk to campus. FAFSA depends on your own situation. It can fully cover your tuition if you qualify for the most help. Overall though Chico is one of the top budget friendly colleges to go to.",

There are external scholarships (meaning private groups that give out money) and they award money out all the time not just once a year. There is also the Wildcat Scholarship which is from Chico State directly and is open in January, and the money is given out in August.\n\nIf you need help affording things, the Basic Needs program does a lot of good work with the free food pantry, subsidized housing, emergency loans, and other services you can see on the website. Plus you can get financial counselling from the Financial Wellness Clinic if you need help budgeting, paying down debt, or saving money.\n\nThere are also on campus jobs available through the Associated Students (our student union) and through the university directly.",

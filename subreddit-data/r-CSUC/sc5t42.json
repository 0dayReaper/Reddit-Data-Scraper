    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a prospective student and considering this as an option for transfer from a CC. I\u2019ve heard some things from previous alumni about the undergrad program, but I thought I\u2019d reach out and see if anyone previously or currently attending can tell me their experience in this program? And what can I expect? How would you rate it out of 10 to summarize your whole experience, 1 being the worst, 10 being the best",

I\u2019m very happy I made the decision to transfer to Chico and chose to apply to the DPD here. The professors have been very kind to me. They care a lot about your mental health and are really understanding. The coursework is a lot, I won\u2019t lie. I had to work my ass off to get straight A\u2019s last semester. I\u2019ve learned a lot and haven\u2019t hated any of the classes or my time at Chico. \n\nYou have to put in effort to get into the program itself, so expect to be stressed the semester you apply. While you\u2019re in the DPD, get a job as a diet aide. You absolutely need the experience for dietetic internships. \n\nYou can message me if you have more questions. I am graduating in May.",

I think it really depends on the area you go to school, because some areas have great health departments and getting a good paying job wouldn\u2019t be so hard",

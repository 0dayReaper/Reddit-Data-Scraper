What do you think would be better?",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve (sorta) lived in 4 different Chico dorms- Whitney for my first semester, Sutter my second semester as an RA where I frequently worked in Shasta and Lassen, Konkow for a week because Covid, and now UV because being an RA was shit, lol. My takeaway after everything is\u2026if you want a group of randos that you can call your \u201cfriends\u201d for the year who you can feel comfortable going to parties and stuff with, then stay in a dorm like Sutter- since Whitney is being shut down. If you want to be in a space where you\u2019re going to be \u201cforced\u201d to be super close with your suite mates then stay in UV or Konkow, they\u2019re laid out as individual apartments with two people to a room, with a joint living room and kitchen. I feel if you stay in UV or Konkow you\u2019ll have a much easier time not just meeting people, but actually making friends, but at the same time, you\u2019re very limited to only the people in your suite as opposed to a place like sutter with 4 floors and 52 residents to each floor- give or take. While the bonds you make in UV or konkow may be longer lasting, as you advance in your major and join extracurriculars, you\u2019ll probably start to make friends with those overlapping interests, but that\u2019s just what I did, and not everyone has the same experience, some people meet their best friends in the dorms, or even their future significant others, so really the decision to choose between a large dorm or a small dorm is up to you and what you want from your college experience",

I\u2019ve shared a room my whole life so I don\u2019t mind if they are big or small, I just want to be able to make friends and be comfortable in the space. I like both Lassen/Shasta and Sutter, since I would prefer to live in the main campus, I\u2019m just having a hard time deciding between the two (as my first choice).",

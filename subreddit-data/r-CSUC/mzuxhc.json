    "postText": "I am incredibly frustrated with the lack of classes being offered in person in the fall in my department. Departments have been given the opportunity to add more in person classes and mine at least is choosing not to. In the sociology department, only 2/21 professors have decided that they want to return to in person. One of my professors, who is one of the two who is returning to in person, told me that the decision was left up to faculty if they wanted to return to in person. She cited health conditions as a reasoning for professors not returning wanting to return to in person. How can 19/21 professors have severe enough health conditions that prohibit them from being in the classroom? Departments should be making every effort to return to in person in the fall with modifications. I can think of many ways to return to in person with modifications, and I do not have a PhD. If elementary students can wear masks in a classroom and wipe down their desk between uses, I would think that college professors and students could do the same. Students have to make financial decisions regarding housing. We can\u2019t just decide to keep working in our home office because we\u2019ve gotten accustom to it. We can always return to online from in person instruction, but we cannot do the the reverse. Professors need to realize the impact that having a year online has had on students success and mental wellbeing. If we want more classes to be in person, students need to demand change. We need to email our department heads and professors and ask them to make every effort to return to in person. I want to receive the quality of education that I am paying for. If I wanted to participate in an online program, I would have signed up for it. Professors who are actively not choosing to return in person when they have been offered the opportunity to do so are creating a disservice to their students, and it is only going to further inequalities in education. I\u2019m fed up, and you should be too.",

            "comment": "So as someone who did the online sociology program I can for one tell you - all of these professors are equipped to teach online and do it well considering they\u2019ve already been doing and didn\u2019t need to pivot much to transition. While I don\u2019t agree with the people who go to school on campus asking to pay less for their tuition to learn online (as if online students do pay that much for whatever reason) . I do agree that not everyone can learn online. It takes a lot of dedication and discipline and it\u2019s not an easy feat. \n\nI\u2019m pretty curious who is willing to teach in person? (If you want to share) Because to me it almost seems like the ones who don\u2019t want to come back are doing so because they know they can teach online and they already offer it as an online program so it\u2019s more a convenience thing, than it is a \u201chealth\u201d thing....",

I'm pretty sure Business just added an online MBA so obviously the school is going to keep moving forward hard with online learning. I think it will be a way for them to expand enrollment but not have to expand the physical campus which is kind of great for commuters. So much easier to be able to attend school online if possible rather than driving an hour for classes.",

You\u2019re not exactly paying for Harvard here. The instruction you receive online is just as good as what you receive in person. Just because you don\u2019t respond well to online instruction, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s lower quality. \n\nAlso, sack the fuck up. Read your text book, do your assignments, and get through it with our expecting the world to cater to your preferences. In 15 years, when whining through your masters, you not going to think twice about the year and a half you spent doing distance learning at Chico State.",

But no one chose a global pandemic. \n\n\\&gt;I have sucked it up and been online for the last year and a half. \n\nWhich is great, and for good reason! You pivoting to meet the challenges of COVID is awesome. \n\n\\&gt;If we continue online when it is not necessary, the university is providing a disservice to their students\n\nWho determines this necessity? You? Sorry dude, your learning style doesn't dictate necessity. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html) still associates in person instruction as high risk. Putting a rush to broad, in-person instruction, because you're over distance learning is dumb. \n\n\\&gt;and it is unfair for professors who do not have medical issues prohibiting them from returning in person to not make the effort to add more in person classes. \n\nFirst of all, you don't know which professors have or don't have medical conditions, and the idea that an underlying medical condition is the only contributing factor to server complications of COVID is wrong. Secondly, you don't know the family structure of your professors. You don't know if they have elderly parents or partners at home that are susceptible to developing severe complications of COVID. And based on the tone of your post, I'd venture to say that you don't care. I would say, its unfair of a college professor to risk their health and the health of their family to provide in-person instruction, when a perfectly viable means of instruction is available, because you think learning online is too hard. You're in college. You're an adult. Sack up and do the work.",

However, with the rate the vaccinations are being distributed, the fact the CSUs are requiring students to be vaccinated, and the fact that California is planning on fully re-opening the economy on June 15th does not warrant classes remaining online in the fall. You do not know the particulars of my department, my situation, or how I should be handling my mental health after being online for three semesters. Just because your mental health was fine online does not mean that others should be. I understand professors who have health conditions which prohibit them from returning to in person. But it seems unlikely to me that 19/21 professors in my department have severe enough health conditions that they are unable to return to the classroom in a modified setting. Vaccines were created for a reason, and those who are most at risk should have already been vaccinated by now. They are making a decision to not make an effort to return to the classroom. You are no longer a college student. You do not get to tell other students what mode of instruction is best for them, or that we should have to participate in online school even when it is no longer the only option. There are modifications that can be made to make the classroom safe, and some departments will make that decision to make those accommodations. But mine has not, and you have no right to tell other students who have been abiding by the guidelines set by the state as to how they should be feeling over the university\u2019s decisions when they do not impact you.",

The experts we pay and entrust with that do.\n\n\\&gt; You do not know the particulars of my department, my situation, or how I  should be handling my mental health after being online for three  semesters.\n\nYou're absolutely right, nor am I commenting on your department. Your mental health is your mental health. Get some help, take a hiatus if it's declining to the point where you can't bare to be online.\n\n\\&gt; But it seems unlikely to me that 19/21 professors in my department have  severe enough health conditions that they are unable to return to the  classroom in a modified setting.\n\nIt doesn't matter what does or doesn't seem likely to you. Your university's policy isn't based on your assumptions of a particular matter.\n\n\\&gt;  Vaccines were created for a reason, and those who are most at risk should have already been vaccinated by now.\n\nYes they were. But you don't know the vaccination rate of any population. Just more assumptions.\n\n\\&gt; They are making a decision to not make an effort to return to the classroom.\n\nThis is really the skunk of your argument. You don't know what's motivating the policy of the university, each department or the faculty. Instead, you're making some pretty harsh assumptions based on your own individual preferences. You're painting a picture of lazy, apathetic faculty because they're not making policy for you.\n\n\\&gt; You are no longer a college student. You do not get to tell other  students what mode of instruction is best for them, or that we should  have to participate in online school even when it is no longer the only  option.\n\nI am still a college student actually! I finish my masters in about 2 weeks. But more to your point, you \\*are\\* a college student and you don't have any right to degrade the caution expressed by your faculty and/or staff. Sure there are modifications that can be made. My partner is a high school teacher, and their school practices those modifications for in person instruction. But that policy and those modifications are based on a cost-benefit analysis of the need of the population they serve, against the safety of the staff. Odds are, your department, and the university as a whole, conducted a similar cost-benefit analysis when deciding not to open the whole school back up to in person instruction. The fact that you're an adult, and not a child, was probably one of those considerations, and less of \"how hard\" online school is for you. People with much more experience and foresight than you probably weighed these considerations and made a decision for the population as a whole (again, not just for you).\n\n\\&gt;  and you have no right to tell other students who have  been abiding by the guidelines set by the state as to how they should  be feeling over the university\u2019s decisions when they do not impact you.\n\nI'm not telling you how to feel in anyway. Your feelings are your feelings. Your actions, though, in this specific case, are pretty terrible. You're not the center of the universe. Demanding that policy be made based on your particular challenges, and then casting doubt and fallacious aspersions on the motivations of faculty and your university as a whole, because they don't acclimate to you and your specific issues is dumb.\n\nAs an aside, kid. You're posting to a online public forum. That gives anyone, include me, the right to respond to you in disagreement regardless of the impact the university's policy has on me individually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick off topic edit: Does Hidalgo still teach in the soc department?",

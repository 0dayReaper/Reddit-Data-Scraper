Life continues on after this round of tests and no matter what happens you're still here and you still have the choice to keep moving toward your goals. I've been working on this degree for 16 years, chugging away a class at a time, and I've absolutely bombed quite a few finals. Still here, still breathing, still awesome, and so are you.",

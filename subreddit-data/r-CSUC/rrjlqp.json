I love live music and ideally will be surrounded by other musicians, is one of the res halls known for a live music community? I also like to read and write. I am pretty left-leaning politically and generally just want to be surrounded by creative types. If you have any suggestions lmk!!",

            "comment": "like the other commenter said there's a good mix of people in all dorms. However, there is some themed housing if it interests you and I would mostly look at the style of living for most dorms when deciding.\n\n Konkow has first-gen, Lgbt, and global experiences. You live in a \"house\" (still dorm-style rooms and just a single floor dorm) with a full kitchen with about 15 other people. It's also a little off campus so it's a short walk.\n\nWhitney/Sutter is very similar with lots of people. But Sutter is newer/nicer so more expensive and Whitney has more fire alarms and is kind of where the \"party\" people are. \n\nShasta/Lassen are similar they just have fewer people and you get a half kitchen. I have also heard it's quiet. \n\nUV is like a mile from campus but it's apartment-style with your own kitchen and bathroom to just share with your roommates.\n\nCouldn't tell you anything about esken or mechoopda",

I don\u2019t know about Esken though, I thought it was just a normal dorm\n\nI\u2019ve heard Sutter is fairly quiet, being the newest dorm and with Whitney being right across, it\u2019s the place to be for people who like to go hang out in Whitney/Shasta/Lassen but don\u2019t want to deal with the fire alarms\n\nThe walk to UV from Campus and vice versa sucks, if you\u2019ve got a class in the Arts and Humanities building you\u2019re in for a solid 30 minute walk if you miss the bus. My gf used to live in UV and while she loved her roommates, she definitely didn\u2019t enjoy the walk",

I have been doing well so far this semester, so I figured if I could squeeze in one more class this school year, that would be great.\n\n I wanted to see if anyone had experience with this and if so, what was it like?",

            "comment": "I did intersession classes pre-covid. They are very condensed, but one of the benefits is that means there's no time for long drawn out assignments. It's like a rapid fire of lecture, questions about what you literally just heard, and next lecture. So for some people that's easier. You just have to pay attention and answer the next set of questions. \n\nFor other people that's harder, they need time to digest it, re-read, highlight notes, etc. And they can't just be told something and immediately know it. \n\nAdded to that is what class are you taking? If it's a difficult math class required for your major, then maybe that won't work in only a few weeks at 8 hour long days. That's just too much and you might need that knowledge for a future class.  But if it's a 101 level class elective, then maybe you don't care too much and can BS a little bit. \n\nTL;DR it depends on your style and it depends on the class you take.",

It's really just a lot of \"busy work\" work 4 or 5 days out of the week, and some sort of weekly quiz.   \nEvery day, for 1 month, it's: Watch this hour-long video and write X words on it, make 2 discussion board posts. At the end of the week, take your multiple-choice quiz.  \nHowever, **this experience will vary greatly** depending on the class you're trying to take.",

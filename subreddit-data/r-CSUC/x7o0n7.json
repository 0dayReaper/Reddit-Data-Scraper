    "postText": "The last 2 semesters, parking would be hard to find around like 11am, but good god this semester if you get to campus anytime after 9:30 its just slam packed with cars everywhere searching for parking. I\u2019m tired of having to pay for metered parking when I already get paid for a parking pass.  Hundreds of empty R-1 spots \n\nI thought enrollment was supposedly very low, yet the parking is worse this semester than in previous. Hopefully this heat ends soon so I can ride my bike again.",

            "comment": "Nope chico state when I enrolled in fall 2021 as a transfer it was a 62% acceptance rate. It\u2019s now 90% or 92% because covid brought admissions down because people left. I get what you mean those stupid R1 spots are for like staff or people who work there but still I see hundreds of those spots open yet when we pay over $200 for a parking pass they only give us the top two levels of the parking structure or stadium parking. It\u2019s insane. Last week I said screw it and just parked in an R1 spot and got a $60 ticket because I was going to be late to class.\nFor a school that makes over $136 million a year just in tuition fees alone (I\u2019m sure they make way more) they sure do suck at giving adequate parking. They should at least make a student only parking structure. Sick of seeing empty R1 spots and getting stuck in long lines in the structure just hoping someone comes and leaves so there\u2019s an available spot. Also who Carries around quarters anymore? I save all my change at home, why would I leave it in my car. I wouldn\u2019t mind however if the meters were like downtown and you could also use your card tho.",

The actual enrollment number has substantially deceased. \n\nParking does feel more like an issue recently but that can\u2019t be attributed to the acceptance rate. Possibly though this semester has more students in-person than last semester.",

There\u2019s a reason so many people don\u2019t have cars in Chico. You just have to get their early, you can\u2019t roll in around lunch and expect to get a spot",

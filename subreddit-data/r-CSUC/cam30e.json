As I go to register, I'm wondering if the online courses with a scheduled lecture absolutely need to be attended at that exact time or will the lecture be saved to view later on? Or does it depend on the course? Does anyone have experience with this? Thx!",

However, you should email your professor to clarify.  You can  find their faculty email address a number of ways including on the department faculty list.",

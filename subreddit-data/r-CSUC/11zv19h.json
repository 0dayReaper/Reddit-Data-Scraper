There\u2019s a couple little connivence stores for snacks and like two coffee jobs, a healthier food store, and then the food court itself has sandwiches, Mexican food, Chinese food, and American food (burgers, chicken strips) but it\u2019s a pretty set menu. I detest the sandwich shop.. the bread is so dry lol",

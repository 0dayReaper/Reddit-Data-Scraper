    "postText": "So i went to Chico state right out of high school fall of 2018 and ended up leaving after that semester due to a number of things. I know it\u2019s probably gonna be really hard to find housing when spring rolls around so i figured my best bet is gonna be like Craigslist or something since i only want like a 6 month so that I\u2019ll be able to get my own apartment for the following school year, BUT i wanted to post on here too because i would always see people looking for lease takeovers or people graduating and needing to fill rooms/just having rooms to rent in general so if that\u2019s going to be anyone in spring feel free to let me know :-)\n\n\nALSO i do have a dog she\u2019s great with other dogs and is house trained! But she def has to come with",

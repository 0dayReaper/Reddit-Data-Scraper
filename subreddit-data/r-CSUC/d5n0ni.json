I think you'll get a good sense.  Cost of living is cheap in Chico compared to most other cities.  Housing in Chico is extremely difficult to find after the Camp Fire.  Chico is half a day drive from lots a great locations: Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, Sacramento, Fort Bragg, Mt. Shasta, etc.  You could watch the sun rise in Chico, ski in Tahoe for lunch and have dinner at the Pacific Ocean... if you wanted to spend all day in the car that is.  You don't need a car for your academics but it helps for shopping.  The city population is liberal but the rural community is conservative.  \n\nNot really.  Fall graduations that open up housing for Spring term are uncommon.  Most housing in Chico is based on the Aug - July schedule.  Most students graduate at the end of Spring term in May.  If you're a transfer student you'll be eligible for some student housing (University Village) but the dorms on campus are for first year students.",

But to be competitive at the career fairs, you should should have a specific career in mind so you can choose courses/electives which will make you stand out in that field.  If you plan your program with a bunch of easy 'survey of' courses and don't specialize in anything, you'll be outmatched during hiring by students who did specialize.",

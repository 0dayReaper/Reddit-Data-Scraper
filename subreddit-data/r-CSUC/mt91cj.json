    "postText": "Hello all I need some help and some advice. This is alot for me to explain and I don't really know how to explain so I will do the best I can.  So here is my story I applied as international relations major as a transfer pre covid in the fall of 2019 for fall 2020 before the stay at home orders and lockdowns that happened  and got accepted into Chico and other schools that I applied to which one of them was SF State which I currently attend. Now honestly it probably the worst mistake I have ever made. It was my last semester at my CC so at the time I chose SF cause it was near by home and I could commute back and forth rather then living in campus and save some money  as it  would be better for me but I still wanted to have a college experience where I could get out of town and the bay area. However Chico was my first choice as I wanted to get out of the bay area since I grew up and it also had my major. I ended up choosing SF state as it also had my major  thinking it would be fun as they have international relations and was told that they have a good program  and that I would enjoy it even though everything would be online and virtual since lockdowns were issued and the stay at home orders were announced. So little did I know this decision overall  would be a complete disaster and ending up being a  unsatisfying transfer experience for me.\n\nSo after accepting SF state and starting my first semester their as a transfer it was straight up terrible for me and ended up being a disaster for me. I do not  wanna bash online learning  as I think we have all suffered enough with it. Before transferring this was when all  lockdowns and stay at home orders were announced during my last semester at my CC and  it was announced all CSU's would be switching to online and virtual learning.  Once I finished my CC and finally transferred I started the fall 2020 semester at SF state as a transfer. This is one of the things that I realized that would lead to my fatal mistake in and overall unsatisfaction with SF state which was their online learning module system or whatever its called. First and foremost it is completely out of date it literally unattractive. When I was at my CC and other CC's that I attended  they either used canvas  or blackboard and in my honest opinion  SF state has the dumbest learning module system ever being utilized as a school overall  which is moodle or what SF state  calls it ilearn. Canvas and blackboard are more superior than this garbage moodle or ilearn and it took me the whole semester to learn how it works. Using this learning module system for online learning and in the midst of the pandemic sucked and was terrible. Not only did I have problems turning in my assignments with this out of date and unattractive learning module system I ended up almost failing the semester and now on academic probation despite using all school resources  and honestly I'm so far unhappy and want to transfer out.\n\nIn other words I always had an interest in game design and animation and did not realize that Chico had it as a major and was considering doing a minor in it. Im not trying to bash SF state its honestly a decent school and really good professors its just that their learning module system to me is out of date and not modern and it does not fit my learning style. Also I'd like to know how the IR department and program is at Chico. I'm trying my best to explain the situation as its a long story but this is the best I can explain. So I was considering applying again in the fall. Do you guys have any ideas or thoughts and how you overall like Chico as a transfer student or a student in general?",

Or are you taking a gap year?\n\nChico doesn\u2019t accept transfer students bellow a 2.0 GPA, and i\u2019m not sure you would be admitted while currently being on academic prohibition. \n\nBeing in the Bay is probably better for game design and international relations, but both programs at Chico are fine.",

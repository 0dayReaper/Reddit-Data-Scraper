    "postText": "Is it just me, or is everyone noticing that a vast majority of their classmates are opting to attend class online rather than in person?\n\nFor the first couple of weeks of class, it seemed that the opposite was true. But now as we're about halfway into the semester is seems most people are choosing to go to the Zoom sessions instead. This morning one of my classes had 29 students Online which left 3-4 students actually in the classroom.\n\nThe reason for this? I'd chalk it up to subpar class activities, boring instruction or maybe even just the weather getting a little colder.\n\nI would be interested to hear other people's experiences and some other thoughts to why this may be happening. Are you on campus? Are your classmates on campus? Why or why not?",

If that isn't convenient, I don't know what is, lmao..In all seriousness, Pandemic sorta forced students to rely on online resources for everything.So professors need to adapt guess. If you are not offering lotta interaction or some kinda activity in class, I am not coming. Although I understand that it's a lotta work.",

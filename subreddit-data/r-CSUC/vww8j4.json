I'm thinking about doing it but was unsure and just wanted to know if anyone in this subreddit had any experience with it! Thanks.",

I\u2019m currently I grad school and have a leg up on most of the other people in the program because I completed a thesis already through this program. For me the classes were more engaging and support from profs felt more a available. Its also nice to take classes with the same people. It\u2019s not really that much more work so I might have done it even if I wasn\u2019t going grad school.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that you can just drop out anytime and the classes you\u2019ve already taken still count toward GEs. But don\u2019t take science and human values if you can avoid it. It sucked.",

The extra classes, the in-depth attention, and the truly thought provoking assignments gave me some of the best experiences of my college education. If you can do it without making yourself crazy, go for it. But if it isn't a good choice for you right now, don't worry. It's an experience, not an essential.",

I'm transferring to Chico State this semester and received an email encouraging me to apply to the Honors program that said, \"To graduate with Honors in General Education as a transfer student, all you need to do is complete your three upper-division General Education (GE) courses by taking Honors (HNRS) courses while a student at Chico State,\" and how I can \"either complete the upper-division Area B (Science) by taking an in-person section of HNRS 350 (Multidisciplinary Science), or complete the upper-division Area C (Arts and Humanities) by taking an online section of HNRS 392 (Leadership, Power, and Change).\"",

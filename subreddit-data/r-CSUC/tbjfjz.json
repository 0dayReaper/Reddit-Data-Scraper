    "postText": "I'm transferring to CSU Chico next semester. I know it's known as a party school, but I'm personally not interested in that at all. I've noticed that there's inexpensive housing available in the avenues north/northwest close to campus. I asked the town subreddit why that is and they said it's a heavy partying area. As a student, is that a dealbreaker? How obnoxious is it really? Additionally, are there any other reasons why I shouldn't go for a place in that area?",

C) live a little further away, little quieter, but more expensive\n\nThere are exceptions to the second and third options with certain areas, but I would avoid the aves unless you\u2019re ok getting bikes stolen, cars and houses broken into, general sketchy characters.",

            "comment": "I've lived in the aves for over a year now since transferring to Chico. anything past 2nd ave is quieter. 1st and 2nd ave have parties but they're not as big as the ones that go on in the Streets (ie 1st -9th st and hazel/ivy/chestnut) If you want really quiet and inexpensive, then you'll have to live further than a mile from campus. usually within a mile of campus its pretty busy.  from what I know Nord ave ( which is a main rd/ hwy 32) has a ton of apartments but its not party central. Its also close to campus, there's walkways that take you from nord straight in to campus. I  have tons of friends who live on nord and love it. if you want a really nice place that's quiet, look for a rental house or apartment in the aves on the other side of Esplanade or mangrove ave . also look in to month to month leasing places out by 20th st and the mall . its a very nice area out by 20th with a lot of newer apartment buildings/more suburban/ family homes. look in to moving in with roommates who want to live in a quieter area, you can probably get a nicer and bigger place if you do that. Hope this helps!",

Mainly Chestnut Hazel and Ivy from about 4th-11th. Sure if you literally live on like 4th and Ivy you'll hear people outside but beyond that you'll survive.",

Not as many parties as south of campus but people still throw house/appartment parties and blast music late into the night. \n\nWhen I stayed over at my gf's place on 2nd Ave &amp; Warner there would be multiple houses/apartments bumping music every weekend and some weekdays past midnight. The cops were called many times and they break it up for that night but then the next night they're back at it again. Some people just don't give af about their neighbors.\n\nFor OP, just rent a place that further from campus. The small increase in your commute to school is definitely worth the peace and safety. Once you get to 6th ave and onward it becomes much nicer and calmer, more families and professionals.",

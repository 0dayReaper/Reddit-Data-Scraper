There is a general job fair, a tech-specific job fair (mostly looking for CS students in particular), and some individual employers coordinate with the department to host workshops/talks/events/recruitment meetings\n- I don't have statistics for students as a whole, but I teach CSCI 630 Software Design \\&amp; Maintenance and I know of multiple of those students who landed summer jobs in the field\n\nSide note: our MS program also attracts quite a few international students and employment gets more complicated dealing with visas and such. However, our students garner a lot of interest and seem to do relatively well in the job market as a whole.",

Did you mean to say that opportunities for international students are much less because of the visa status and such ? And looking forward to learn CSCI 630 from you . Generally, how is the current job market scene for the current international students who will be graduating now . We\u2019re they able to find jobs ? Thanks in advance",

However, this is not Chico-specific, this is broadly true for all of the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking, the job market is tougher than it was a couple years ago because a lot of tech companies (by their projections) over-estimated their growth during the pandemic; consequently, there were layoffs and fewer new jobs advertised once the economic realities of inflation became evident. Nevertheless, CS is still an in-demand degree and is growing at a rate better than most other careers.\n\nFrom what I'm aware of, more students who graduated this Spring were having trouble finding jobs than in our previous years, but the impression I got is that our graduates are still doing relatively well finding good jobs. Our department and the office for international students have been diligent about supporting students to find jobs and when necessary, to help students navigate the policies/laws as best as we can to make sure they get jobs before the grace period expires (when they'd have to leave the country).\n\nOur department chair, Tyson Henry, can speak to more specifics about this than I can so if you have more questions, I suggest you email him.",

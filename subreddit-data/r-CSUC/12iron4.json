    "postText": "My daughter got accepted to CSUC (and a few other Cal State schools and a couple UCs) and is leaning toward Chico State; and I have a few questions.\n\n* Most importantly - how do you like Chico State?  Are you happy there? Do you think it's a good experience?\n* How safe is it for a reasonably naive girl freshman.  Googling, it seems it historically had a reputation as a party school; which makes me probably like a typical paranoid parent worried.  \n* Is it reasonably easy to change majors and/or double-major and/or add minors?  I think she's not totally sure what she wants to do.\n* How's housing?  Easy for freshman to get on-campus housing? I don't see anything about guaranteed on-campus housing.\n* How stressful is it there.  Hard weeder classes?  Friendly supportive professors?  ....  \n\n\nAlso - sorry in advance if these are all FAQs - I see a pinned \"Quick Guide for new students\" but that's 5-years old.   And I skimmed recent posts for similar questions and only saw a few; but feel free to tell me to just look further.",

And it is a beautiful place. I was walking around on the tour with her saying that I wanted my money back. The university has modernized in all of the right ways.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a current student about to graduate.\n\nChico state is a good school, she\u2019ll have an easy time meeting people since we\u2019re no longer in the pandemic. (It was really hard for me I came in as a transfer Fall 2021 when campus got shut down again so no one was here) it\u2019s a pretty campus and super easy to walk from class to class. \n\nIn regards to the parties, I currently go there , my brother in law and sister in law graduated last year and both of them said after about 2019 the partying died down A LOT. And can confirm there\u2019s maybe like 3 or 4 frat parties each weekend and they usually get shut down around 11:30pm- 12am. So there\u2019s really not much partying going on anymore. I will say that recently chico state has taken a massive lack of enrollment hit so you\u2019re more likely to find people who transferred in as opposed to those who came in as freshman. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of clubs and activities to do as well! Also it\u2019s super easy to change your major as I\u2019ve done it multitude of times I came in as a business student , changed to psych then to food studies, then back to operations and supply chain management then project management and now finally I am graduating with a marketing degree. Took me some time to really narrow down what I wanted to do because like I said I came in as a transfer and community colleges only offer so much compared to uni. Most of her first year classes will be general Ed so she will have so much time to figure out what she wants to do. I\u2019d recommend nailing down what she wants to do by her second year as junior and senior level coursework have pre reqs that need to be completed during her first two years . (Like for example I had to take managerial and financial accounting my first and second year in order to take an upper division financial course) admissions counselors will be able to go over a bunch of stuff with her. There is also a tool online for general academic advising where she can take tests based on her personality and interests and it will develop a list of possible jobs she could pursue based on her interests and personality. (I\u2019m a business major with a big interest in science so it made sense when I got a lot of stem related jobs on my list) \n\nFor the next school year one of the dorms (Whitney hall) will be closed, however there is others both on and off campus that are available you just have to apply . There\u2019s also an off campus university housing called university village that\u2019s not exactly like a dorm it\u2019s kind of like a shared apartment sanctioned by the school, I have friends that live there and they like it . So everyone gets their own separate room and then they share a common area (kitchen / living room) . That would give your daughter more freedom than in a dorm and she won\u2019t have to eat food provided by the dining hall on campus (I heard it sucks) so it would give her freedom of having her own place and making her own food and stuff. \n\nAnd honestly the weeder classes depend on the major . As a business major I\u2019ve had a pretty easy time except for my classes that require statistics or statistical analysis. My brother in law has a degree from Chico in molecular and cellular biology and there\u2019s a TON of weeder classes because you go through multiple levels of chemistry, physics , math etc. same goes for engineering. Honestly just depends what major she chooses. Every degree is hard but I will say STEM based degrees always have weeder classes. \n\nHope this helps!",

It's a beautiful area with tons of outdoor activities around, and politically the town is pretty purple. Cost of living is low for California.  Safety/party wise it's nothing like the reputation suggests (as others have said).  I saw far crazier things visiting friends at UC Davis/ Berkeley than I did at Chico.  That being said, it is still a college and kids do party. Professors were largely very supportive.",

            "comment": "It's been a minute since I was a student, and I didn't experience anything related to student housing, so I'll skip some of those questions. \n\nAs far as how safe Chico is... I think a lot depends on where you live (on campus is probably safer than some of the closest neighborhoods, farther away from campus is also going to be safer but has its drawbacks). I never felt like I *had* to participate in the true \"college experience\" meaning parties, frats/sororities, etc., but again... I was busy with other things and that's never been my personality, if that makes sense. I was also a tad older when I started (20 vs. 18) and had lived on my own/had some life experience, vs. just jumping right into college as my first away-from-home experience. \n\nI found it relatively easy to change majors/add things, depending on what your major is and how long you're willing to be in school - I started out as a business major, graduated with a degree in English, considered pursuing a double major in criminal justice so took some classes over there... however, if one is interested in majoring in some of the more intense STEM majors, those fields have a much \"stricter\" schedule - you have to take certain classes in certain orders, or else your whole path gets messed up. Whereas with English, I could take pretty much anything in any order I wanted, be pretty selective in terms of my schedule, which professors I wanted to take, etc. \n\nAs far as how stressful it is... it is what you make of it. I was able to work full time (32+ hours/week) while taking all of my major classes... but I majored in English, which I found to be relatively easy. Other majors absolutely have harder low-level classes that do serve as a weeding-out process. Human Anatomy, for example, is quite rigorous but required for many life sciences majors (it was the only class I dropped while in college because I knew I wasn't going to have time for the amount of studying required!). That said, I found the professors I had to all be pretty passionate about their subjects and willing to help out if a student was proactive with seeking said help - if you're struggling from the get-go, you're more likely to get assistance than if you wait until week 14 of the semester to realize you're failing. But I think that's probably true of any school.",

I look back at my time fondly. I definitely had a \"good\" time but I got a great education. The business, computer science and engineering departments are great. Chico is rated highly on it's success rate vs cost.\nMany of the big tech companies regularly recruit from Chico. I also met my wife there. Our son who is also graduating this year is going to FSU. We live in FL now and as a parent I have many of the same concerns. FSU is known as party school as well. At the end of the day all schools are party schools and it depends on the student more than the school on how much partying and how serious they are about their educations.\n\nChico as a whole is a pretty safe place. Like anywhere else, she should avoid walking by herself at night on dark paths that traverse the campus. There are call boxes around if there is an emergency. Walking through the downtown is safe. \n\nI lived in the dorms my.first year and it makes the transition a little easier. It's college and when you get to your upper division classes it can be stressful. Alot of work, assignments and papers but overall I think Chico prepared me well for a successful career. If I was still living on California, I'd have no problem sending my kids there.",

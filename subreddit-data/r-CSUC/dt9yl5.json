            "comment": "Not necessarily true. West side of the tracks is very heavily student populated. So expect lots of parties, cops, shit like that. With that comes the homeless, but you are gunna get that no matter where you live here. \n\nThe area directly north of campus and the high school football field (Wst 1st and Citrus area) is way more sketchy in my opinion. All the streets are extremely poorly lit and I constantly see homeless people walking around. I know some homeless dude also shot on one of those streets last year as well. I used to live in that area so I have a little experience. \n\nSo I in all, I would say west side of tracks it louder and just more shit going on what with all the student, but isn\u2019t as shady as other places around town",

Also that whole stretch of sac ave from there to the intersection of warner is not lit really at all. So it\u2019s definitely a sketchy walk at night. That\u2019s really close to the other area I was talking about as well so expect lots of homeless roaming around. \n\nI\u2019m gunna be honest, that spot isn\u2019t ideal, but you are pretty close to Nord so hopefully it doesn\u2019t get too bad. I would say you\u2019re right on the border of the sketchy shit",

I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like exactly, but I\u2019d assume anywhere that\u2019s directly off of Nord wouldn\u2019t be too bad. Again, it\u2019s just a lot of foot traffic from students, but Nord is lit up fairly well and there\u2019s constantly cars driving that road so I don\u2019t think personally safety there is too big of an issue. It\u2019s a lot quieter the farther down Nord you go. Right where Nord turns into Walnut is a pretty nice area (where the dominoes and Sinclair station are). Not nearly as much foot traffic but you still got enough police cruisers and lights to where it doesn\u2019t feel very sketchy at all. Plus it\u2019s not too far of a walk to downtown from there. So I would personally recommend somewhere on the south end of Nord and walnut if possible. \n\nI know a lot of students live on the northwest section of West Sac (past the chevron), but I\u2019ve never personally been there so I couldn\u2019t tell you what it\u2019s like.\n\nReally I would just emphasize not living in that west 1st/citrus/warner area that I was talking about earlier. That place it just all around shitty",

You don\u2019t want to live in the avenues - W 1st ave, W 2nd ave, etc. There is some sketchy business going on in this area. Not only is it poorly lit but the crime rate is higher. \n\nThe streets (W 2nd st, W 3rd st, etc) are generally better to live in on the campus side or west side of the tracks. The campus side in this area is where the frat and sorority houses are, so there are people walking around all the time. It can be loud at times if you live right next to a party house. \n\nOf course, however, you should always be cautious anywhere you go as the amount of transients in Chico has dramatically increased after the fire. Plus, some college students are just assholes. Additionally, there have been reports of potential sex traffickers around the Safeway area on Nord.",

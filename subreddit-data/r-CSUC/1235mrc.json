As of now, you need an 80% from the TEAS test, which is apparently very difficult, and if you don't pass, you can't reapply for Chico's program for another 2 years. Just because you pass the TEAS, it doesn't even mean you're admitted to the program either. Getting admitted to Chico is a breeze, but into the nursing program not so much.",

Also butte college is planning an accelerated adn that\u2019s points based so I\u2019ve been looking into that as well. Then RN to BSN at Chico. \n\n60 points is really high though and Julie said last semester that the average was 60-61 for the cut off but enrollment is still on the decline so that could change. I think you\u2019ll definitely at the very least make the waitlist. Plus enrollment is down at all CSU\u2019s and some people will probably decline as they get into more local schools and have a better chance at getting in. \n\nGood luck with getting into the program. You\u2019ve clearly worked hard to get where you are.",

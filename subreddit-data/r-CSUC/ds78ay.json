It has come in handy more often than not as well (last minute assignments, unplanned library visits, etc). But as others have said, I think it kinda depends on your major and what kind of work you will be doing. I would think that a tablet would be more than adequate for general day to day tasks.\n\nAs far as financial risk of breaking or losing it, I think that\u2019s your call to make. I\u2019m pretty good at keeping my laptop protected and with me at all times, so I don\u2019t worry about that. If you think you will be moving it around constantly and frequently leaving it unattended to, then maybe you should just stick with the tablet. You know how responsible you can be better than anyone on here.",

The cost for books and supplies is high in that figure, but that might just be my major looking out for their students. A lot of textbooks are free thru the library, even in GE courses. I spend maybe $40-100/semester on books and paper.\n\nIf you want to park on campus you need to spend an extra $130 or so for a permit. Metered parking is $0.50-1 an hour from 6am - 6pm or 10pm depending on location. The county bus system is free as a student, so if you go that route your transportation costs are lower.",

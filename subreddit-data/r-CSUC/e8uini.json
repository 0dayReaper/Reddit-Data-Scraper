I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s not that near to a beach but I heard there are other great outdoor activities \ud83d\ude0a so how do you like studying at Chico and do you have any tips? What makes Chico special? \n\nI am also somewhat concerned that it maybe can get a bit boring because it\u2019s not the biggest city but I hope Chico proves me different \n\nGreetings \u263a\ufe0f",

If you decide yo come here check out Adventure Outings, they run through the University and offer all sorts of fun trips/activities. Whitewater rafting, Backpacking, skiing,  kayaking, rock climbing, etc. It's a great way for people who are unfamiliar with the area to experience some of the best recreation Northern California has to offer. https://as.csuchico.edu/index.php/adventure-outings/",

There's always a concert, art show, class, parade... \n\nWe are kind of in the middle of nowhere, but less than two hours from Sacramento, and 3-4 hour's drive to the beach, the Bay, Tahoe, Yosemite National Park, Mt Shasta, and more. Northern California is an amazing place to be if you enjoy hiking, camping, rock climbing, and bird watching. Bidwell Park is our crown jewel - 3,670 acres of swimming holes and hiking and biking trails. Lower Bidwell Park is more in the city center and has a rose garden, playgrounds, and a natural swimming pool.\n\nAs far as CSUC itself goes: I am now 33 and have gone to several different school from a for-profit online school to Temple University in Philadelphia. Chico State is the best school I've been to, hands down. The school is small enough to build relationships with your professors and really get the help and attention you need to do well, while large enough to have access to funding for better equipment and facilities (they're in the process of building a brand new physical sciences building!).\n\nWhat are you studying? Have you been to the US/California before?",

It's part of the culture out here (at least outside of the city) to go to work and then head straight to your favorite swimming hole. There's a designated nude beach in Nevada City on the Yuba River, about an hour and a half from here and there's a swimming pool at the campus gym (not nude). Winter is rainy and cold, snow is very rare at our elevation but it's not far at all if you enjoy skiing/snowboarding. I recommend a pair of rain boots.\n\nI'm studying computer engineering, so I don't know much about the child development courses. I do volunteer for a local organization called Reading Pals where we read with elementary schoolers who are reading below grade level. It's lots of fun and a great way to see what it's like at an American elementary school.",

            "comment": "I was born and raised in Chico, and now live in Europe, so hopefully I can bring a more \"global\" perspective to this? :)\n\nChico is a lovely *small* city -- It's not a large californian city like some people envision when they hear \"california\", but it's not a rural village by any means. It's a bustling college town with lots to offer, surrounded by small rural, farming communities and pretty sparse lands; in that sense, it is a bit more isolated than other places you might be considering. You will need to drive, takes buses, or take Amtrack Trains to get to larger cities like Sacramento (1.5 hour drive), or to San Francisco (3 hour drive). Its downtown area has lots of independent shops, yummy restaurants, and fun bars to explore; everything in that part of town is walkable and easy to get to. You will get a true \"american college\" experience here, if you're after that; the university is surrounded by a ton of old houses that the students and fraternities/sororities occupy, and it's common to see house parties taking place there on weekends. People are generally pretty friendly and welcoming here.\n\nIf you like the outdoors (mountain biking, hiking), then Chico is definitely a good choice. Chico has a stunning park and river that runs through the city; lower park is a dense forest complete with walking trails and a rather unique public swimming pool, while the upper portion of the park is rugged and wild with hiking and mountain biking trails. I'm biased probably, but I have traveled extensively, and I do believe lower park (and the downtown area as a whole) has a special and unique charm to it. Others have mentioned Adventure Outings; they're a great resource if you're interested in these sorts of activities. They arrange trips and experiences that are pretty neat; it costs money of course though, if you're on a budget.\n\nIf you are after big city life and those infamous california beaches, then Chico may not be ideal for you. It does take time and money to travel, plus planning. You can make weekend trips of course and I'm sure you will be able to see a ton outside of Chico, but it will be more of an inconvenience than it would be somewhere more central. It depends on how much of that big city life you are wanting. Chico will be less expensive than the larger cities, though, which is nice. And, it's a bit more personable compared to a big city.\n\nI hope I helped a little? Feel free to PM me if you want; I'll try my best to answer any questions you may have about the uni or the area (Northern California as a whole included.) If you do end up going to Chico and would like the comfort of having a \"lifeline\" I can always pass you my folks' phone number and contact info; I studied abroad once and I know they would be more than happy to help you if you ever needed it. :)\n\nEDIT: I forgot to even mention the uni, lol. It's a beautiful school, imo. What are you studying?",

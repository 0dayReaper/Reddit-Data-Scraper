    "postText": "After going through all the schools I got into for transfer, my mind is leaning towards CSU Chico and Uc Davis for computer engineering. I wanted to ask in what ways could I benefit by going to Chico over Davis. Class size, job opportunities/networking, and quality of education.\nAfter aid, Chico and Davis are about the same for me, but Chico could end up being cheaper for things outside of school stuff. I have a friend already in Chico which would be cool. I\u2019m not sure what the culture at Chico is. Any opinions would help me decide",

            "comment": "I can't speak too much about the programs. Chico has a strong Computer Science/Engineering College. But UC's tend to be a bit more prestigious than CSU's. And UC Davis probably does have more big name companies showing up to their career fairs. \n\nHowever I can speak about regional differences. \n\nIf you love nature, hiking, cycling, camping, If you like farmer's markets, small town vibes, and being able to get away from it it all and have privacy.  Then I recommend Chico. We are a 90 minute drive from 3 different National Parks in 3 different directions. But there is a ton to explore just in the local butte county area. (especially if you have a car).\n\nIf you prefer being close to big city life, like having a ton of options of things to do and businesses to visit, want a vibrant night life/clubbing atmosphere, enjoy visiting the bay area often, or use air travel a lot and don't want to be an hour and a half away from the airport, then UC Davis is probably a better choice.",

Davis is in no way a big city with a ton of options to do with a vibrant night life, quite the opposite actually. You could drive to sac (usually like 30 min) if you want that type of stuff but its usually not worth it imo",

Davis is also a small, quiet city with lots of local things going on and farmers markets twice a week. There are tons of nature trails and the city is designed for biking. I cant say for sure for chico, but if one is interested in big city stuff than neither school is probably for them lol.",

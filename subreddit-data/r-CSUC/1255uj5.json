    "postText": "This might be controversial, but I\u2019ve been told by my strongly conservative parents that SF State is known for pushing left sided views, they don\u2019t want me to attend. Personally I\u2019m more liberal but very centered on the political compass, slightly leaning into the bottom left corner. My question to you guys is, are the professors biased? Is the bias overwhelming and strong? Do they acknowledge  the other side and other sides views? Do you as a student feel free to speak your opinion without strong repercussions? \n\nThank you!",

I went there during the trump election when he won and from what I could tell it was pretty split. Because of that the professors aren\u2019t quite as strongly biased, but that definitely varies between majors, as I would say my journalism teacher was a bit more passionate with her views, but she would always acknowledge the other side and for presentations she always had the stance of \u201cjust make your argument\u201d. A girl did a presentation on why kneeling for the flag is unacceptable, and I know our teacher disagreed and so did a lot of students, but the teacher simply said \u201cyou need to give more objective claims by using outside sources, not just simply your opinion\u201d which was actually fair because this girl really just did an \u201cI feel\u201d presentation for a journalism class, which the point is to gather information from sources. The teacher did not attack her views at any point, just simply asked her to do better.\nI was a science major, so I really only did one journalism class, but unsurprisingly in science, left and right bias doesn\u2019t really show since it\u2019s not necessary for the subject material. Really if anything you would really only get attacked for your views from other students, which I saw plenty of, but institutionally the bias is fairly minimal from my view. I\u2019m sure those who went through a humanities major might have a differing opinion from me.",

            "comment": "From what I\u2019ve experienced, the town of chico is pretty conservative , however the school is more on the liberal side. I\u2019m a business major and none of my professors have been bias at least from what I\u2019ve seen. They just stick to teaching you the required material. What I feel your parents might be talking about is not exactly the professors but the school itself and the type of people that attend. If you go to let\u2019s say Berkeley or SF you\u2019re more likely to see protests, rallies, and other things to push certain issues like social justice, lgbtq stuff etc (you get the idea) you meet a lot more people from those schools with more \u201cliberal\u201d ideologies. I also attended a CC in the South Bay Area for my AS degree and even then none of my professors were bias. For example I had an American government professor who taught at the CC who also taught at SF state and he kept a pretty neutral stance on political things and ideologies. He just stick to teaching us about the US gov and how things worked and important figures etc.",

Or maybe you\u2019re in class and have a trans student, and your professor uses gender affirming language. Is that considered left.\nI study nutrition and in our communication centered classes we discuss the fat acceptance/health at every size approach. I know several students roll their eyes during those lectures because they feel the science isn\u2019t adequate. But as students we are encouraged to voice opinions. \nI\u2019ve never had any issues voicing my opinion or asking questions. But there are certainly classes that can get contentious. I had a communications / sociology course where we discussed racism and our role in society minimizing it. That forum definitely stirred up some debate. Especially among the white students and BIPOC students. But I never felt the professor take over the conversation with Bias. \nI\u2019m sure there are some conservative students who don\u2019t wanna share their opinions in some classes. But Ive never heard it be suppressed by the professors. \n\nI\u2019m very left leaning .. if that adds anything to my comment.",

I was more curious if a topic were to come up if the teachers there are voicing the other side, from you said, seems like that is the case. I personally think the science lines up great gender and sexualities, but I\u2019m always open to hearing the other side. I wanna know how other people feel.",

Id wager they probably lean left, but I\u2019ve known professors who mention more conservative/moderate views in conversation. \n\nProfessors are usually professionals who try and navigate those questions without rocking the boat. Students on the other hand are very opinionated often times. \n\nFor example, if a conservative guest speaker wants to come on campus or if a conservative group tables on campus, you will see students protest or argue with them being there.",

I think if a conservative wanna say why abortion kills babies they should be able to voice there opinion. A) I believe in the constitution and first amendment B) it just makes you understand how you feel about it more deeply and you can get the other side to understand you C) arguing is fun as long as it stays in control, no violence and physical harm, no slurs, no name calling.\n\nIf Ben Shapiro (lol) shows up to a college I go to in signing up to listen so I can further support why I think he is very very stupid.",

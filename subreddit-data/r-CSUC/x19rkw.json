            "comment": "The Computer Science Department is at the top of their game right now. Most of the \"old, outdated\" faculty have retired. Most of the current faculty have been there 10 years or less. Two new professors started this semester. The department has a lot of energy and is very strong academically. Morale is high and students are excellent at supporting each other. Their cyber security courses are best-in-class. Their security club regularly score well at competitions. Last Spring they placed 36 out of nearly 1000 teams  [National Cyber League Spring 2022](https://cyberskyline.com/hosted_events/ncl-spring-2022).",

In all honesty I was not the best student but the CS department does a great job connecting students with companies that are actively looking for new hires/interns. I ended up getting an internship the summer before my last semester and then got hired full time by the same company after graduating. One thing I will say is that as you progress through the program there\u2019s a greater freedom to focus on the areas that really interest you.",

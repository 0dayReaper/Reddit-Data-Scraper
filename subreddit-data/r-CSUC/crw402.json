My roommate has successfully kept his bike from being stolen by using three different u-locks, and removing the seat and bringing it inside everytime. \n\nAlso, make sure to not have easy removing wheels, you will lose them. The seat removing is also a good idea because they'll steal seats. Hell, my girlfriends pedals were taken from her bike.\n\nHaving a bike is amazing up here because it's such a huge biking city. But that's also why the homeless and such like to take any bikes not properly locked up, or bikes with flimsy locks. Don't use a lock that can get cut with something as simple as bolt cutters. You WILL lose your bike.",

I cannot recommend them enough, especially if you're living anywhere near downtown or campus. However, even with that extra security my pedals were stolen (again).",

It's best to keep your bike on a rack in your home.  Bums in many college neighborhoods will come back when they see you're out of town.  Off season burglaries are thing here.",

They found Davis had a worse bike theft ratio than Chico did.  They found that when compared to similar communities, there was no evidence of it being \"bad\".  Chico is apparently average in this sense.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the Camp Fire has changed this town in lots of ways.  There is more crime these days, but I've been told by Chico PD that is't a statistical increase that matches the population increase.  Again, crime is a real thing obviously, but Chico is apparently \"average.\"",

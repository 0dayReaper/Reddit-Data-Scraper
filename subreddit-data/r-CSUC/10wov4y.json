    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to drop my classes because I commute to school but I lost my job and can\u2019t afford my car payments. So yeah my life\u2019s falling apart and I can\u2019t mentally or physically go to college right now. Every time I try to drop it says I\u2019m unable to.\n\nUpdate: I called and withdrew from all my classes. I almost cried on the phone I hate how my life fell apart in a matter of a week. I am sure I\u2019m going have to find some way to pay financial aid back. Goodbye Chico state and wildcats",

            "comment": "If I understand your situation, it sounds like you need a planned educational leave / withdrawal rather than just dropping individual courses.\n\nCheck this out: https://www.csuchico.edu/sro/registration/withdrawal-procedures.shtml\n\nNote that the \"census date\" (the deadline for drops / withdrawals without significant repercussions) is [Feb 17th](https://www.csuchico.edu/fa/eligibility-enrollment/census.shtml). Do your best to handle things before then.\n\nTake care of yourself. We'll still be here when you're ready to continue your education.",

    "postText": "So my sister is an incoming freshman and got an email today saying she\u2019s been placed on the waitlist for university housing. Just wondering if anyone\u2019s had experience being on the waitlist and whether they were able to secure a spot or not. She\u2019s pretty stressed about it now and is worried she won\u2019t have a place to live when she moves up. Thanks in advance!",

I asked them what they thought, and they said the housing fills up really fast but that people will drop out as it gets closer. There is not much you can do except for wait and hope unfortunately. I would watch the waitlist number till the beginning of August, then if no luck I would immediately get on the Chico State Class Of 2019 and 2020 pages and find housing that way. Another option is to look into Craig student housing, which is dorm style for freshman at Chico and Butte, just privately owned. Honestly, living in the dorms helped give me a super important college experience, but it also cost me about double what it would have costed me to live off campus in a  house or apartment. Sorry I couldn\u2019t be of more help!",

I've searched around for housing and I know quite a few apartments/websites that I can look at if your sister needs help finding something. I pay around 10 grand a year for housing and I have my own room and restroom with a shared living room on an individual lease. Also, I'm about a 10 minute walk from campus or a ~6 minute bike ride. Feel free to message me if August comes around and your sister still hasn't heard back because the housing crisis is dumb crazy and it's best to be safe than sorry.\n\nEdit: I also put in my application around this time as well for dorms. If anyone else needs help, feel free to pm me and I will do my best to help you out!",

It is a sketchy situation and I was lucky because this was pre-Camp Fire and there was a good amount of options for me to choose from and prices weren't that bad. I tried looking for something different in January and each month I waited to find something new, the more and more literally everything was getting taken up. Stuff is limited and it will be hard to find something for August but it shouldn't be totally impossible. Just depends on how picky you are for what you want, location, etc.",

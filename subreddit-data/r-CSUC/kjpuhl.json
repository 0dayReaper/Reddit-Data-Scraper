    "postText": "Okay I have a question. Due to covid I kind of finished my BA a lot earlier than expected. I took 6 classes in the summer (I know i\u2019m kinda crazy). Anyways, i\u2019m now about to graduate in May but I haven\u2019t even networked or talked to any of my professors on a personal level. How would you guys recommend I get recommendation letters for grad school? I rushed so quick through the program i\u2019m finishing a whole year early so I feel I didn\u2019t have time to network. Any advice is appreciated!",

    "postText": "I have 1 semester left, 6 units. I'm looking to take about 6 more units in courses just for fun, or at least practicality. Ideally, wanted a couple music related ones, but they are restricted to music majors. The next two on my list are MKTG 305, Survey of Marketing, and i guess KINE 152, Introduction to Dance. I did dance in HS and an intro course at my last college, but its been like 4 or 5 years so I'm iffy about it. Ballroom sounds cool, but they separate men and women courses, and I'm not thrilled about dancing with a bunch of guys.\n\nOthers on my list are like rockclimbing, backpacking, or some art/music related courses.",

They just have a men\u2019s sign up and a women\u2019s sign up to make sure the numbers aren\u2019t too uneven. When you actually go to the class, it\u2019s men and women, and it\u2019s a fuckin blast. It makes you feel way more confident when you\u2019re at an event that has music and people dancing.\n\nAlso, Dr. Himberg (who would likely be the professor) is awesome. She\u2019s a little quirky, but if you get the chance to get to know her, she is amazing.",

Totally outside my major but interesting and I learned some valuable stuff. \n\nYou get your own set of four tasting glasses. It\u2019s online and meets on campus in Plumas Hall once a week. You do all your coursework online and then the class meeting is for tasting. \n\nThe guys that teach it are super knowledgeable and at the time I took it, they were actually trying to get a viticulture program in place at Chico. You get to sample some pretty amazing wines of all different varietals, and in some ways they line up in a particular way during the semester. \n\nI highly recommend if there are any spots left.",

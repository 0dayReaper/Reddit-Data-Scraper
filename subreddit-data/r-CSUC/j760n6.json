    "postText": "Hello all! We need your help!\n\nThe survey is 12 questions long, mostly multiple choice. It should take no longer than \\~1-3 minutes to complete. We require as many submissions as possible from current students, so please feel free to participate if you are interested. After you are finished, please leave your student email to enter the $50 Visa cards raffle.\n\nMy team is currently tasked with distributing surveys across California college campuses for market research purposes. The five of us are participating in a senior experience project as CoBA students at CSU San Marcos.\n\nHere is the link:\n\n[https://share.hsforms.com/1TBtZozHiSX6LZJv3wdfv1Q3rvou](https://share.hsforms.com/1TBtZozHiSX6LZJv3wdfv1Q3rvou?fbclid=IwAR1VrjJ2XF7L5x9FPOBuzPrOdRXzjxkPeOhszSQZRORs60kCnwVg6Amx5ik)\n\nWe appreciate your time and contribution to our project!",

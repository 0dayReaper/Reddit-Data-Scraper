I\u2019m going to major in business or major in Chem and minor in business. \n\nIt would mean so much to me if I could get some help with me decision!!\n\nI want to take advanced academic courses and I\u2019m not the biggest partier, but I am very social and would love to meet a-lot of people. \n\nI plan to live on campus.",

            "comment": "Your in luck, I did undergrad at SFSU (microbiology minor in Chem) and masters at Chico (biology) . I still get alumi email from both.    \nI had a decent living situation in the City so that is the first thing I'd point out about my experience, it ain't cheap...    \nSFSU is bigger and feels bigger too, but can feel a bit like a job with everyone coming and then going home.   \nChico is busy enough to feel like \"college\" but chill in a small town kind of way, and with a larger local student (on and off campus) population to hang out with people more easily.  \nNeither school is known for science but both had wonderful career teachers once you hit the upper division courses.   \nSFSU does win for having more jobs after graduating but if you don't plan on settling down that doesn't mean much in the long run. \n  \nAt both you will meet plenty of people especially going into the dorms, with Chico is will be way easier. \n\n Summary: if you can afford it, a few years is SF will not be regreted. If you don't want to, or can't bare the city stuff, Chico will tick all the boxes an employer will want.",

I think students will tend to spread out more in SF and commute to campus rather than have the campus be a central point of life like Chico has. But I don't know much, only my limited experience of my time at SFSU.",

            "comment": "The education will likely be very similar no matter which one you choose. Both schools have very good business programs, and while not \"known\" for science, you will get a good education. It really comes down to other aspects like social, housing, affordability, etc. \n\nI will say that SFSU is definitely more of a commuter school. Many students work full time and take classes on the side, or commute into the city to attend class, then go back to their homes further away once class ends. It doesn't feel like a college community. Also, it's tucked in the furthest (and foggiest) corner of SF, far from almost everything else in the city. \n\nChico on the other hand is a true college town. The majority of students live within one mile of campus, the campus is in the heart of downtown, and the university and the community are intertwined with one another. It is really easy to make friends, and there is always something going on. \n\nFrom an affordability perspective, Chico will be much, much cheaper (groceries, housing, restaurants, bars, etc. are all way more affordable up north).",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a Current senior studying Business Marketing at Chico State. My sister in law has a degree in small business management from Chico state and my brother in law has a degree in cellular and molecular biology from Chico state. (They both graduated last year. I\u2019m graduating this year)  my aunt has an engineering degree from Chico and my uncle has a marketing degree from Chico as well (graduated about 7 years ago) \n\nI have friends that I know that go to SFSU but they\u2019re doing degrees related to liberal arts or health sciences. They have said class sizes seem to be bigger than what I\u2019ve told them my class sizes are. The cost of living is very high and it takes a while to get to classes on campus since the campus is big and there\u2019s a lot of traffic surrounding the campus \n\nSpeaking from experience and my family\u2019s experience Chico has great professors for both majors that you\u2019re thinking about. My brother in law really enjoyed his time at chico state and he said the one thing that was great in the biology/chemistry department was the class sizes are very manageable and you get more personal time with your professors in labs as lab sizes are only about 30 people while lectures (pre req classes usually) will have about 100+. He always talked about how he really loved how his professors were very involved in students work and labs. \n\nAs a business major regardless if you\u2019re doing pre req coursework/ge or upper division major specific classes I\u2019ve always had a good experience with class size and being able to personally connect with professors and get more personal time and help. Most if not all professors I\u2019ve had have always taken the time to help students understand the material. (Always check rate my professor before picking a professor as there are some duds out there just like at every school)  the class sizes are roughly 25-40 students (depending on the class) however I can\u2019t really speak for the lower division Gen Ed classes as I transferred in from a CC in the South Bay Area so my GE classes were never filled with more than 30-35 people. \n\nI think whatever you choose will be fine but Chico has a lower cost of living, 90% of students live within two miles of campus so you could walk, bike, drive or even take the bus for free wifh student id to get to campus. The campus at chico state imo feels more homey if that makes sense? It doesn\u2019t feel like a huge campus with drab buildings and people minding their own business. There\u2019s always something happening on campus, lots of club activities and people are more friendly! \n\nas a side note , if you go in to business information systems and do either management info systems or the operations and supply chain management degree chico state has 100% job placement 3-6 month before grad and within 6 months after grad. The Business admin program has roughly a 90% job placement within 6months . These are all recent stats told by my professors in the last year.\n\nAlso the alumni for Chico state runs strong, I was offered a junior buyer position last November for a logistics company in the Bay Area ( which sadly I had to turn down for certain reasons not related to the company) not only because I had purchasing experience but the department manager picked up my resume and wanted to interview me because I was a Chico state Student and he was an Alumni of Chico state. We spent a good portion of the interview talking about school. Alumni for Chico state stands strong and you will find wildcat Alumni EVERYWHERE and they usually have each other\u2019s backs when it comes to finding work! (Not only in my experience but my familys too)",

    "postText": "&gt;Dear Students, \n\n \n\n&gt;Today, the CSU system decided to move forward immediately with a requirement for students, faculty, and staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (or obtain a valid exemption). The official policy will be forthcoming.\n\n \n\n&gt;Students who plan to be on campus must have at least one vaccine shot prior to the beginning of classes August 23 and must be fully vaccinated by September 30. Vaccines are not fully effective until two weeks after the final dose, and at that point a person is considered \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d Anyone who isn\u2019t yet fully vaccinated is required to wear a mask in all campus facilities. Please note, student populations, like those living in University Housing or participating in NCAA athletics, are required to be fully vaccinated prior to the CSU deadline.\n\n \n\n&gt;I understand this is a significant change from the CSU\u2019s announcement in April which stated that the vaccine mandate would take effect upon full FDA approval of one of the vaccines. New developments make it clear that we simply cannot wait. The Delta variant has caused cases to spike nationwide and COVID-19 remains a very serious threat for those who are not yet vaccinated. Going to the grocery store, a favorite restaurant, or class can present an unnecessary risk for those who have not taken the vaccine. For these reasons, I support the Chancellor\u2019s decision.\n\n&gt;As a thank-you and to encourage you to submit your vaccination info early, the University will hold weekly drawings for fully vaccinated students. Beginning August 3 and continuing through September 10, we will award 10 $100 gift cards to the Wildcat Store and a grand prize of Apple Air Pods each week. All students who certify they are vaccinated in the Student Center are eligible and no further action is required on your part.\n\n \n\n&gt;We will share additional information about the CSU policy and its implications for our campus as soon as it is available. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions about the vaccine requirement on our COVID-19 website. \n\n \n\n&gt;We know that widespread vaccination is our clearest and best path toward mitigating this pandemic. It is also the key to providing the collegiate experience you deserve. One where you can socialize with your friends and collaborate with your classmates and enjoy all that Chico has to offer without risking your health. \n\n \n\n&gt;Sincerely, \n\n&gt;Gayle E. Hutchinson\n\n&gt;President",

I think the main difference here is that some people, while they're not against vaccines, are waiting for further scrutinization of this treatment. It is still only approved for emergency use. The university is putting more cautious people in a position where they have to do something against their choice.\n\nEveryone SHOULD be vaccinated but not with a mandate. If the delta variant is this much of a concern, then maybe another remote remote semester is a better option.",

If you're on the east side of Warner Street, it's a bunch of cute houses. Between warner and Nord, the aves seem sketchy. \n\nWe've lived on Rio Lindo Ave, not too bad. There's a creek path right next to the property, but we never personally had issues with anyone on the path. \n\nWe now live off Forest Ave and have had no issues there in the 2 years we've been there.",

            "comment": "Do not get an apartment that lines the train tracks your apartment will rattle and be loud whenever a train passes by. Get an apartment at least a block or two away from the train tracks (if you\u2019re trying to be closer to campus) the most popular area to live in is the area that\u2019s closest to the school (within a mile) , stay away from the \u201cjungle\u201d area which is an area off of 5th Ave kind of behind the dominoes on nord/walnut , lots of parties and crime happen around there. The streets are more lively from 2nd all the way to about 8th st because of frats, house parties, and Riley bar. If you want to live in a quieter area, live in the aves with is w Sacramento ave all the way until 8th ave. If you\u2019re looking at a map of the school from the corner of Warner and 2nd st with the train tracks behind, the streets are to the right side/ east of campus and the aves at to the west. I\u2019ve lived mostly in the aves with my fianc\u00e9 the last two years for school because there\u2019s better parking for you car, it\u2019s quieter, you\u2019re not dealing with loud noises from parties and drunk people walking the streets and to me it just looks nicer. If you\u2019re looking for a more family oriented type area, anything past the 99 fwy on the other side of town will be significantly more quieter and nicer (may be a little more pricier though) Hope this helps !",

Also it\u2019s not good to live next to the tracks if you get up early for work/school, have pets because cats and dogs have really sensitive ears and the train is required by law to blow a horn when passing each crossing, or if you\u2019re a light sleeper or have insomnia. I live a few block away from the train and I have had a much better experience that those I know who live right up against the tracks . I can still hear the train but it\u2019s not as loud and my place won\u2019t rattle and it doesn\u2019t bother my pets. When I looked at places next to the track I remember the property management agent asked if I was a light sleeper and recommended to not be against the tracks if you are",

Not only that but they will place the most inept, disgusting roommates in your apartment. The walls are paper thin as well, meaning extreme summer eat and absolute zero insulating In the winter. Absolutely do trust the reviews as well.",

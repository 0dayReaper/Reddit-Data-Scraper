    "postText": "Hey everyone. A couple of friends and I are looking at getting an apartment for our first year in Chico. We just toured the Pine Tree apartments and it looked great but I\u2019ve read many reviews that say the management is horrible and will do anything to make sure they keep the security deposit.  Is it worth it to stay here?",

Fight for it, but never count on getting anything back - you will always be disappointed. \n\nEnjoy your time in Chico.  Best 4 years of my life.",

Would reccomend but you might not get ur security deposit back.",

I didn't have a problem with management and received my full deposit when I moved out.  I felt safe there and liked the direct pathway to campus.",

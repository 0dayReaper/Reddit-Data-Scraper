Highly recommend \ud83d\ude0e Chess is everywhere, it's just a matter of if a school has an organized club.\n\nYou can join the CICL intercollegiate community on Discord: https://discord.gg/Y5Tf938\n\nAnd I could check records and possibly put you in touch with any Chico players who signed up for this or past events.",

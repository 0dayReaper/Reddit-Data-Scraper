(If you try to enroll without the CRT, there will be a flag on your account that will not allow you to enroll.) You should probably talk to your major advisor, but what I have outlined is the official policy of the Math Department.  You can call them at 530-898-6111 if you need help.\n\nPS  You should always go to University advisors first (since it is their JOB to know how to do this stuff), NOT reddit, where you are likely to get misinformation...",

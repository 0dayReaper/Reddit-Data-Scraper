Is it easy to adjust to the small town life? I'm form the LA area so I'm not sure if I'd be able to adjust to a small town setting. I want to go into film/video production, so I would most likely apply as a Media Arts major , so are there any people with that major that have some opinions on it?",

That might be because it mimics the suburbs decently well and that is a lot of OC. Its a nice change of pace. I have a friend who is in the media arts department. He told me that they have a crazy 2 million dollar soundboard in their recording studio. I dont remember the name of it, but apparently its the holy grail. I know the head of the department is pretty cool. She once got her friend Joe Escalante, the drummer from The Vandals, to speak to the school about the music industry. That was super cool as a fan of punk. Apparently, the department head used to be a crazy punker back in the day, you wouldn't guess it from her nice suit.",

Once you are here for a couple years you realize that it is actually a lot bigger than we think. Coming from the places where you and I come from, Chico is for sure a different way of life. Here, you are submerged in nature it feels like. There is trees everywhere, there are actual seasons, and farming/agriculture surrounds the city. I left Orange County in 2015 and currently still here wrapping up my grad program. You're going to love it! Chico State is one of the last residential schools in California. A majority of the students on Campus live a mile away from campus. You cannot get this small college town vibes at a lot of other places. Not to mention that you get to enjoy your time away from home, rent is fairly cheap compared to living at others schools, and the environment is awesome. Beware though! Culture shock is real. Chico State is for the most part liberal, but in a majority conservative area.",

Excluding party options, Chico feels more like Palmdale or San Bernadino (if you limited yourself to city limits) than it does to Little Rock or Yucaipa. Butte county itself definitely feels more like how LA county feels up in the high desert around Palmdale, just replace the yucca trees with grass and pines at elevation.\n\nFood-wise there's plenty of individual *places* to go, but cuisine options are more americanized with fewer ethnic options (with \"americanized asian food\" and \"mexican food\" being the most wildly available).\n\nA lot of pastimes in the area involve going out into nature (upper park, feather river canyon, etc) or the group of people you surround yourself with (parties, bar crawls). There are events at the local fairgrounds but they're not as back-to-back as they are in urban areas like LA, Sac, SF Bay, and they aren't as jam packed w/ stuff because there's less competition up here. The good news is that Sac is a bit over an hour away and the bay is around 2-3 hours away so you have access to big urban metro areas if you want.",

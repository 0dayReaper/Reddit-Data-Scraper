    "postText": "I'm a senior in high school and have applied as a freshman to Chico State for the Fall '22 term. A big part of my hs culture has revolved around seeing local rock, punk and indie bands at a small local theater and I would hate to miss out on something like this in college! Is there a music scene like this at Chico? Can someone please describe their experience with student rock bands at Chico? (I specifically want these genres \u2013 no rap, pop, etc really interests me). Lack of music scene is not necessarily a dealbreaker but I would *really* miss it.",

It's nothing major though a small niche group that helps put on local punk shows \n\nI briefly tried to get them connected with the chico state music department who puts on shows (mostly r&amp;b) but I think they werent interested cuz of stereotypes of the punks here being junkies or drunks \n\nMy experience is I can understand why they think that, but theres also decent people and decent shows.",

I\u2019ve walked through campus at night in the early evening time alone and have been fine however I\u2019d suggest anytime after 8-9 pm make sure you walk with someone just as a general safety rule. Especially if you are walking home from bars through campus have someone with you. Chico is pretty safe just have someone with you. It\u2019s also very safe to walk alone in the day time",

These blue lights have phones that directly linked to the University police station, located on campus. If at any time you do not feel safe you can always pick up one of these phones and be escorted to your destination.",

Do you guys carry it everywhere in your wallets, or do you take a picture of it on your phone or something like that? Also, do you guys know if you can have a hot water heater appliance in your dorm room? Thanks!",

I had an electric kettle in my dorm room, and I\u2019m sure coffee makers are fine too. I\u2019d recommend getting one with an automatic shut off.",

However if you do lose your student ID, you can pick up a replacement for $5 at the IT center across the library but it is needed to print paper at the library, swipe into the cafeteria and more. Your key is also important. I lived at Whitney and we were allowed two opportunities to get locked out of our dorm as they would give us a key to do so but i would recommend to keep these things with you at all times. I had a coffee maker in my dorm which was allowed. I also had a toaster and a kettle. Apparently those items were prohibited, but i was told that when RAs come in to \u201cinspect\u201d (never happened to me) you can simply hide these things under your bed or something",

            "comment": "Basically everyone gets one of those lanyards to clip their ID onto when they\u2019re in the dorms because you need it to swipe into the building. It\u2019s also swiped at the dining hall when you\u2019re using your meal plan. I just clipped my room key on there too so they\u2019re always together. I think you can have an electric kettle in your room as long as it doesn\u2019t have a hot plate. If I remember right you can\u2019t have things with a hot plate but it\u2019s been like 5 years so I\u2019m not certain. They\u2019re gonna tell you though for sure. Generally speaking though if you want to have a coffee maker or something in your room, just don\u2019t let the RA see it and hide it when they do the inspections once a semester, that\u2019s what most people do. I had some extension cords which you aren\u2019t technically supposed to have but that\u2019s what I did and it wasn\u2019t an issue.",

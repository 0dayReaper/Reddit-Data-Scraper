    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nCollege application deadlines are coming up and I was hoping someone could give me some advice. I'm applying to get into Computer Engineering/Electrical Engineering and truly stumped with what 4 CSU's to go with for my application waivers. I'm just really afraid that I might not get accepted into any of the following schools I'm interested in: \n\n\\- Pomona, San Diego, San Jose, Chico, Long Beach, Fullerton\n\nMy SAT score is 1000/1600 (got the same score twice - Math: 500; English: 500). My GPA is 3.2 and I calculated my MCA score to be 3765 (currently in AP Calculus, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Environmental Science and getting A's &amp; B's).\n\nI come from a low income family so I can only afford to choose 4. Which would be my best bet to use my waivers on given my grades and current standing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Cost of living has gone up here since the Camp Fire, but I'm guessing we're still considerably cheaper than the others you listed (unless you're living for free with family).\n\nLast Fall we actually had a [shortage of freshmen admitted who enrolled](https://www.chicoer.com/2019/08/21/local-college-enrollment-down-slightly/) so that might work in your favor, both for odds of acceptance and availability of housing/dorms.",

Chico is a great school, with an amazing Engineering department and a real nice community. The only problem I\u2019d say is that housing is a little cramped right now because a lot of people from Paradise had to move here.",

SDSU and Long Beach are probably long shots as well, but I don't know much about Fullerton.  For your gpa, are you sure that is your CSU gpa?  That can be different than your hs gpa.  Have you toured any of the schools?  Of all the ones we saw, Chico was my son's favorite, and so far he is happy there (freshman this year).",

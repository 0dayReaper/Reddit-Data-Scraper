    "postText": "I'm currently a junior taking all virtual classes and I'm considering attending in person in the fall. I'm just curious about how things are with COVID? Are classes awkward? Do you feel it's worth it to move for my last two semesters? At first I really wanted the college experience but now that I have my routine with online classes, I'm re thinking it. I really don't know what to do! I also should state that I am trying to be COVID- conscious so I don't really want a roommate or to live the dorms. \n\nPart of me really still wants to go, so just want to get a sense for what things are like on campus now. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Last two semesters? So a year basically? I would go. Leasing contract is usually a year, so it works out kinda perfect. Getting one roommate is not that bad. Dorms are a disaster in my opinion, even before Covid. Most people are being dropped from in person if they are not vaxed from what I remember. It\u2019s getting safer and safer. I would say next semester, or a semester after that we might even start going back to normal. Idk about classes because I moved out after covid hit, but it seems that people are having some fun from time to time in class ( I hear it through zoom ). I think it just depends on the major and people. I would say a year alone is worse than a year with people and restrictions. If it was only 1 semester, then I would just not bother.",

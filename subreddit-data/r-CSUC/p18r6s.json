It's a bit expensive tho (like $90/month for boxing 3 times a week or $145 for boxing + bjj or muy thai)\n\nThe wrec offered MMA, boxing, and kickboxing. It was pretty good and more laid back vibe (while still teaching things). The coach there graduated last semester and moved though :/. I'm sure they'll get it up and running again when wrec goes back to normal hours\n\nSomeone else mentioned the sweet fitness kickboxing. I tried it out, it alright. Emphasis is on cardio and not as much on learning. \n\nI'd recommend standalone",

Jason the owner and former pro MMA fighter does the boxing classes. They have a helluva jiu jitsu and Muay Thai program as well. Former pro MMA guy coaching those too.",

The WREC does typically do boxing and Muay Thai style classes, and they\u2019ve been pretty solid in my experience. As another user pointed out, the premier mma gym in town over on 9th street(standalone mma) is legit and if you\u2019re serious about getting better I\u2019d go there. Only place you\u2019ll be able to spar consistently too.. they didn\u2019t really do that at the wrec classes I\u2019ve been to. Good luck with your training from a fellow boxing enthusiast!",

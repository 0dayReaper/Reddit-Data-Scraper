    "postText": "I'm going to be returning from academic leave the fall semester, but before it began I wanted to first move to Chico. I'm looking for houses to rent right now but I technically don't need to move out of my current house until September, the only reason i stay is cause the rent is cheap, and i like my roommates. \n\nI'm seeing some really good deals on rent for some places but they are available now, and I'm not ready to move. my question is should I snag one of these places now or wait for something better to come along in late July or August? or do you think that by July/august I wont be able to find any places i want to rent?",

            "comment": "You will still be able to find places to rent in July or August, but they might not be as cheap as what you are seeing now. Low priced apartments have been scarce in Chico since the fires so they go pretty quick once listed. If you have particular places in mind, call them and ask if they actually dont have availability in July/August or if they just havent listed for those months yet, since some places dont post availability until much closer to the move in dates. That being said, from my experiences the cheaper ones are usually the ones that post far in advance so thats why you wouldnt be as likely to get a low priced apartment in July or August, especially since thats when a lot of people move up to Chico.",

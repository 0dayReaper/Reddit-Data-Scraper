I BELIEVE it\u2019s because of \u2026.ok I don\u2019t actually know why but if I had to guess I would say how close the housing is to the actual campus and the downtown area.",

Plenty of my sober(ish) friends had no trouble making friends in clubs and classes. \n\nMost of it has to do with there \u201cnot being much to do around here\u201d. But I\u2019ve learned to appreciate Chico a lot.",

There are enough parties for people who want to party, but if it's not your thing you won't feel out of place as long as you have halfway decent friends. Go elsewhere if you want a massive party school and big city experience, because there's not much beyond 5 frat parties every weekend.",

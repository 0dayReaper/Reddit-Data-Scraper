Are there any intense running software stuff (for like labs, idk) that would make me want to consider buying a new laptop? Should i buy office 365? Thanks for any advice :)",

Also, I've run parallels just fine; a Mac with the right specs won't struggle, and besides, microsoft programs are available for Mac and I believe there is browser based version of Office 365 anyway. Since it seems OP isn't going into anything computer-based, they are free to pick whichever platform best appeals to them, as long as it can carry out the work required. \n\n[u/Chief\\_Maso](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chief_Maso/), as long as you can run basic software like powerpoint and word, plus browse the web, you should be okay. Maybe try your first semester with your existing laptop to see if it will suffice, then you can decide if you need a new one? Just if you're finance-conscious. Seven years is about the lifespan of a laptop imo though, so I would prepare and start saving for a new one - there are lots of great and cheap machines out there, and you may have a better idea of what you need after your first semester. You'll be fine either way - no need to stress :)",

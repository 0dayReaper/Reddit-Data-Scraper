My next two semesters will probably end up online sadly and having the option to use the health center/wrec/student services doesn't really do much for me, as it is for many students.",

I'm assuming CSUs don't have the money to consider this, at least compared to UCs. Guess I'll just have to take advantage of it.",

I understand where you're coming from as you'll be new but I just think asking for that is just not worth anyones time or money. esp if you don't have a car, its on campus and they'll help you with all sorts of shit. Free condoms too. which are expensive.",

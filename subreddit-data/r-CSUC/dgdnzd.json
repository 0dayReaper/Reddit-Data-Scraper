There's about 2 grills there to BBQ. Also has its own laundry and dryer. Place is nice, with a big ass screen TV in the living room. Everything's pretty much brand new. \n\n\n\nIdk what these comments are talking about given that the price range for the condos are expensive. So I'm assuming the people responding to your comment are either owners of other property management competing with this place. I would definitely recommend the spot.",

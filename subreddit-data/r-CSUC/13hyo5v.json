Also if you going into sales out of school (which 75% of business majors start out in for their first business job), Chico is highly regarded. Top notch businesses recruit Chico alum because they know they got a great education, have above average social skills, and great time management skills. \n\nEducation aside, Chico has sac beat in every category from a social perspective. Not to mention Chico and the nature around it is extremely beautiful\n\nTrust me on this, you will not regret going to Chico",

It requires a lot of driving and drive time to experience the city\u2019s benefits. Chico is smaller and very concentrated with student housing and downtown all nearby within walking distance. At commuter schools, you often need to rely on clubs, including frat/sorority, and events like sports to find friends and bring folks together and build a community of friends. Those catalysts are not needed to find a community of friends at schools like Chico\u2014it happens more naturally because of the close proximity, but can be accelerated by clubs/events.\n\nI mention this because, beyond the obvious benefits, in my experience, your community of friends is more likely to open career opportunities than your degree and education alone.",

I myself am not in it but I have a couple friends there. \nParking is sometimes a pain in the ass, but most of everything is close to each other so you won\u2019t really need a car. Especially if you plan on living on the dorms. Although I imagine the problem is worse in a huge city like Sac. \nEducation is top notch. A lot of great professors and programs. \nAnd of course, it being a more college town experience. Education is cheaper in price too.",

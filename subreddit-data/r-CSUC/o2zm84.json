They exist to help you get financial aid.\n\n[https://www.csuchico.edu/fa/](https://www.csuchico.edu/fa/)\n\n530-898-6451\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically: You should fill out your FAFSA:  [https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) There's a single application for all federal and state aid, and they'll let you know if they need any additional information from you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never lived at UV so I'm getting my information third hand, but I believe there are both options of having a roommate and getting your own room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI highly suggest talking to ITSS for your sign in and picture uploading issues. Here is their website: [https://www.csuchico.edu/itss/](https://www.csuchico.edu/itss/)\n\nand their phone number: 530-898-4357\n\nLet us know if we can do anything else for you",

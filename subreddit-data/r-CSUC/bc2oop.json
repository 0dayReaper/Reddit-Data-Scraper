    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to apply for on campus housing but I honestly don\u2019t know what to pick or what some of the terms mean on the university housing chart, (single,double ,triple) so I\u2019m kind of at a loss. If anyone can help I have a few questions- \n\n-what are the cheapest on campus housing options?\n\n-what hall, in your opinion, is the best? I have my eye on konkow but I\u2019m not sure \n\n-do you get a meal plan with your housing? Or is that somehow separate \n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a freshman if that detail is needed",

            "comment": "I was a freshman this year and I lived in Whitney. I\u2019m not a fan of UV because of the distance from campus, and the same goes for esken/konkow/mechoopda which are all about a 15 minute walk from the rest of campus, but that\u2019s just because I have a tendency to be late to classes and I really prioritized closeness. Also, Whitney\u2019s known as the \u201csocial hall\u201d which is pretty true from my experience, but it can be loud sometimes since the walls are thin. Sutter is really nice (the best in my opinion) since the building is newest and I think the rooms are ever so slightly larger than the other dorms here. Shasta and Lassen are also right on campus, by Whitney and Sutter, but I\u2019ve never been in either so I can\u2019t speak from experience about anything but the people I know who live in there all seem to really enjoy it. \n\nSingle/double/triple/quad refers to the amount of people in the room. People who live in singles don\u2019t have a roommate, people in doubles have one roommate, etc. The more people you room with, the cheaper it will be, but that means you get less personal space. I lived in a double this year and I absolutely loved my roommate, but I know plenty of people who hated theirs or just didn\u2019t really talk to them too much. If you decide to room with other people, I recommend trying to pick your own instead of being randomly placed. Social media is really good for meeting potential roommates, last year there was an instagram page called @ChicoState2022 where people submitted little profiles of themselves with bios to find roommates and friends. If I were you, I\u2019d look into finding one of those pages on instagram or facebook that\u2019s specifically for your class of 2023. Otherwise, you can just use the housing portal itself to find roommates through the application, that\u2019s how I found mine. \n\nThe meal plans come with housing, and you get 3 options. I recommend getting the one with the most flexcash and least meal swipes. The dining hall serves mainly the same type of food all year, so you\u2019ll get tired of it eventually and start using your swipes less and less, and by the end of the semester if you still have a bunch of unused swipes, that\u2019s just money wasted. Flexcash is really nice because you can use it to buy food/drinks from the different cafes on campus or from the BMU (Bell Memorial Union) at the front of campus which has way tastier food than the dining hall (I\u2019d go there all the time if i could afford it lol). You can also use flexcash to buy things from Butte Station, which is a convenience store on campus. I pretty much guarantee you won\u2019t run out of meal swipes unless you have a mini-plan from UV. \n\nIf you have any other questions just feel free to message me. Welcome to Chico :).",

I\u2019m personally a fan of UV, but I know it\u2019s not the most popular because of the distance from campus. Meal plans are required and add to the cost, but you can choose between three sizes that are priced differently.",

            "comment": "On mobile, so sorry for the poor formatting.\n\nThis should be a chart of specific pricing based on building, meal plan, and amount of roommates (which is what the single, double, triple, and quad indicates.)\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.csuchico.edu/housing/apply/room-and-board-pay-plan-2018-2019.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBkPOx08jhAhWdGTQIHZjjCu8QFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0bcRGsYmTOq8l04zZcZnu1\n\n It should be noted that while a meal plan is required, and you choose between 3 sizes, people in Konkow and UV are automatically given a mini meal plan, that they can opt to upgrade to a full one. Any additional questions you have (and even the ones you asked here) can be answered by going to Chico's officially website. It might take a little bit of effort and digging to find what you want, but usually what you're looking for is there.",

He's about 8 weeks and is currently being fostered. He's very friendly, won't stop purring and rubbing on anyone who'll let him. He is also quite playful. Smoky is being treated for roundworm and some skin issues right now (patchy fur). If you are up for continuing this treatment, he is available immediately to a loving forever home. Otherwise, he will hopefully be all better and neutered soon!\"\n\nIf you're interested, send me a dm and I can get you in touch with her. She lives in Chico and is a student here, if you're wondering how this is relevant lol.",

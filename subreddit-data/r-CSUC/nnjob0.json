    "postText": "I was accepted into the University Village housing for this year and I'm just wondering what the process is for finding roommates through the CSUC resident center. I know CSUC housing sent out an email saying that June 1st is the first day that Roommate selection and matching opens, but there was very little information given on how this would be conducted. I'm curious if we are supposed to make a profile? If so; how we are able to find roommate matches if we don't know anybody or have anyone to request as a roommate. If any current students have information they could provide on this process I would really appreciate it as I am a new transfer student who could use all of the information I can get my hands on. Thank you in advance.",

            "comment": "If you don't know anyone you want to live with, then the housing office will put you in with  roommates who fit your profile (like other transfers, or if you filled out the survey about staying up late or being clean etc, they'll match you to similar people). There's someone who works in the housing office that their job is to place people into rooms. \n\nIf you do know some people and you all say that you want to live together, you can request each other on the housing portal. But you need to request them and they need to request you too. If only one person requests someone and they don't request back then it won't happen. They do that so crazy stalkers can't just force themselves into being roommates with their ex's or whatever other nonsense that could happen. \n\nUV is more like apartment style, so you could live in a room that shares a kitchen between other rooms. When I lived there a long time ago it was 6 people sharing 4 rooms and a kitchen, but I think they've changed it since then. Now IIRC it's 6 people between 3 rooms and a living room and a kitchen. (I may be wrong about that).",

So \"roommate\" would mean literally a roommate in the same bedroom but you'll have housemates either way. I guess if you were super introverted you could stay out of the kitchen and only use your exterior door and see no one else. Each room has a passthrough bathroom that connects to another room too.  \n\nI don't know if you can move in early. You'd have to call the housing office. Typically with UV there are people living there year round so maybe they'd do it. But any other residence hall they definitely wouldn't because not even the RAs would be there yet.",

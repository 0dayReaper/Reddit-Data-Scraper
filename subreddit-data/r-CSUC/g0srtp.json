    "postText": "Hello r/CSUC reddit community! My name is Paul and I am currently a Marketing Student at CSU Chico. I am taking a class right now that has teamed up with the Chico Municipal Airport to come up with some new branding strategies for them. The reason the airport has reached out to the university is because the airport is wanting to re-offer commercial airline service. This will take shape as two flights to and from LAX at first and will slowly expand to offering more destinations as time goes on. With this new goal in mind, the airport is wanting to rebrand itself in a way that repositions how people recognize the airport. My team is tasked with coming up with a new name and logo design that accurately represents the surrounding North State region beyond just the municipality of Chico. We have created a survey that will help us gather input from the local community and will help us with making more accurate recommendations for our final project. I will provide the link at the bottom of this post. Any input is greatly appreciated and I hope that sometime in the foreseeable future we are able to utilize this airport!\n\n[https://forms.gle/hermqegwygdb3Lwh7](https://forms.gle/hermqegwygdb3Lwh7)",

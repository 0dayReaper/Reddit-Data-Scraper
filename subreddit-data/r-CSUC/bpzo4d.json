I just finished my first year after transferring and I have friends at almost all California universities so I can help you compare with their experiences. \n\nAs for Chico, it is extremely friendly and the school takes itself seriously so you\u2019ll have many opportunities to get a job.\n\nWhile it is not the same party school it used to be, you can still find a party to go to every single weekend or to the bars and it\u2019ll be packed. \n\nAs a transfer it\u2019s pretty easy to make friends, there\u2019s a lot of transfers to connect with. I chose to join greek life and I would definitely recommend rushing to see if you\u2019d enjoy it too. It\u2019s not all just parties and drinking, although a large part of it is. \n\nA car is NOT necessary but makes life a lot easier up here, everything is within walking distance so it\u2019s awesome and ubers are only $5.",

You learn a lot, theres an amazing community of people, and it's a cute small town. There are a lot of people there just to skate by and party, so you can easily prove your worth above the rest if you work hard and show effort.",

            "comment": "It's great because the cost is relatively low compared to other universities in California, there are a lot of professors passionate about their craft, the campus is beautiful and something to be proud of, and while the city is currently struggling I still love living here.\n\nLike u/I_would_abort_u said though, the current issues surrounding the city complicate things. Housing being the main thing. If you planned on living in a dorm that's one thing, you might have better odds, but if you wanted to rent an apartment or something then you're up against a very long list of other people (mainly Camp Fire evacuees) who are still hunting for a place to live 6+ months later.",

I currently live in yuba city and I wanted to know what you guys think would be cheaper or just better for my sanity, to commute to school or to find a small place to move closer to the campus? \n   \nAnd I want to really immerse myself into life here at chico state but feel like I kinda just leave it behind when I drive home\n\n  I\u2019m also wondering if anyone\u2019s looking for a roommate in there  house close to the campus. Although I\u2019m hoping to find a small studio or apartment to myself.",

            "comment": "Okay I didn\u2019t have as far of a commute but I did make the same decision a couple years ago. \n\nConsider this: I have 10,000 in extra debt that I wish I didn\u2019t have because I wanted to rent an apartment and be closer to campus the first year I transferred in from Butte.\n\nI worked full time through my two years at Butte College and it was hard dividing my attention between work and school, especially my last semester when I was working 60 hours a week and taking a full class load. I actually got laid off before getting to Chico so I just made the decision to do my time there on financial aid and loans. \n\nAfter my first year I moved back home and got a parking pass. I parked in the lot on the corner of Warner and W Sac, and I never had a problem finding parking. The pass was about $120/semester, and in my view that was way more worth it than renting the apartment. Especially cause my sleep was way more shitty at the apartment, my neighbors were constantly partying so it kept me up a lot. \n\nNow with camp fire people living in a lot of normally student housing, and just generally inflation, rent costs are going through the roof. Even if before I fire I watched my landlord raise rent on my apartment by $100/month after I moved out. With the crazy high demand for places they can charge even more and be sure that they\u2019ll get it. \n\nSo it\u2019s your call. I regret renting the apartment. It\u2019s not like I missed out on fewer things by living close by. I still got to all my classes on time, and made it to all the other stuff I did on campus just using a parking permit. \n\nIf you already have a job that you\u2019re sure could cover the cost of rent, then go for it. But consider supply and demand here, and finding a place after the semesters already started could be really hard.\n\nLooking for a roommate would probably be your best bet. Especially if they have a place already and maybe a roommate moved out. \n\nYou might wait until you get near the end of the semester, by then you have a lot of people looking for others to take over their lease either because they\u2019re graduating, transferring or dropping out and going back home. \n\nGood luck.",

It is about a hour drive each way and parking can be difficult.\n\nIf you value having a more socially connected college experience and the cost of living isn't an issue, then move to Chico. If you save a considerable amount of money by commuting then I'd stay in YC.\n\nBeing a commuter can make it harder to be socially engaged. I'm looking into joining a student organization to meet people.",

            "comment": "I moved from outside stockton and was considering oroville because I was worried with my (somewhat bad) credit that I wouldn't find a place. I did find one here in Chico, and it was 1 mile across from the school. I ride my bike everyday, can go to the gym extremely easy (i wouldn't if it was far away yanno) and feel like i can go home and back to school with ease, in between classes or work. Idk what your current rent is but i split a 1bd with my partner for under 900 a month in a decent place and i definitely have to say living close to school changes the game, because the entire time I was at community college I was in your situation, living 20 miles from the school.   \n\n\nSo i am inclined towards a strong yes, you should try to move here within the next few months, maybe just rent a cheap room in a house and get really involved because you have no other options. I find forcing myself into these, at times, uncomfortable situations is whats best for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I'm commuting from Oroville and I have friends that have commuted from Yuba City / Marysville. \n\nIf you can afford to live in Chico, or even Oroville, then I would strongly recommend it. Chico has limited parking and most lots are full by 8-8:30am (full  earlier the earlier in the semester you are).  Asssuming a 1 hour commute that means you're leaving Yuba City by 6:45am to ensure parking. If you aren't a morning person AND don't have morning classes as an option you're basically wasting half your day on campus just to ensure you have a parking spot. If you have to take night classes then you're talking about a VERY long day.  Now imagine that three, four, or five days a week. \n\nI'm not sure what 99 looks like right now but 70 is packed full of trucks moving debris and construction materials to/from Paradise and other burned areas.  On 70 you're pretty regularly stuck behind a truck going 55, so plan for the commute to take a bit longer than you'd typically expect.",

    "postText": "I am a freshman and for journalism 130 I am going to need to interview a total of 9 people over the course of the semester. Obviously this will be challenging because I've only been here for a month and still barely know anybody so any help would be greatly appreciated. As of right now I am going to need 5 more sources, but getting to interview more than 5 other people will not be a problem.  Specifically I am looking for at least 3 people who have been here for over a year: one with a science related major and one who has outside commitments (work, sports, etc.). If you are interested please pm me or message me on instagram @yoomoozoo.",

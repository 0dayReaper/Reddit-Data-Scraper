I know that the students were not happy with the recent response from the University president, but it\u2019s exactly what I expected. \n\nThe University has certain expenses that don\u2019t change much with students off campus, salaries, building and campus maintenance, etc, and they\u2019re also losing a lot of their supplemental income streams, such as parking permits, BMU concessions, football games, etc.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re even coming out negative with students off campus.  Without seeing the full budget it would be hard to be certain, but their possible savings are small compared to the things that don\u2019t change.",

Moreover, you'll see a number of operating expenses that just don't change whether you're on campus or off campus, so the reality is that those in charge of the budget aren't going to change anything -- and accepting that reality isn't bootlicking, it's just being realistic.",

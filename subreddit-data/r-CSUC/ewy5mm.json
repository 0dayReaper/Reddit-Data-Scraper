Depending on your major there are many different opportunities and any don\u2019t consider GPA. Definitely fill it out and save your answers which will make it a snap to apply every year. \n\nIf it takes an hour to fill it out, and you win a $500 scholarship that\u2019s $500 an hour. Do it.",

You should be able to answer those questions about your educational and career goals anyway. It is pain to do it at first but save your answers because most scholarships ask the same questions. It makes it easy to apply",

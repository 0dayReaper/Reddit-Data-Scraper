It\u2019s life changing. They are not that expensive too. I am mostly just worried about the town homeless stuff and the fact that the fire kinda change a lot about the city recently too.",

Also the town is definitely different and more impacted but there are tons of support and people who will look out for you.

As long as you take your best precaution there\u2019s a way less chance anything will happen, it\u2019s just like any big town or city tbh, there\u2019s definitely certain places you know not to go.

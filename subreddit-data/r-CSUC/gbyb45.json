But if Fall 2020 is gonna be online I'm not sure I should do that. I don't want to spend a lot of money for online classes.I really don't want my first true college semester at a non-community college to be all online. \n\nDoes anyone know which way the administration is leaning?\n\nWould a better option be not accepting and just taking a couple of classes at my community college and save money? And then I could re-apply for Spring 2020 at chico and various other schools. \n\nI'm really not sure, this whole COVID-19 situation has got me pretty confused.\n\nAny advice you guys have for me on what I should do about fall 2020?",

Or, alternatively, are there any classes you have to take that are already online-only? You could load up on those and get them out of the way instead of delaying a semester.",

They fully expect to be moving online at some point, but starting the semester in person gives everyone a chance to meet their teachers and get to know each other.",

Its a pain the ass to get stuff together for applications for schools for me and I had to apply several times before getting accepted. From what I understand in the program I am in. (The Game design one) most of the freshman and entry level courses will be online so parents don't have to worry about sending little Timmy off to be sick far away from home. The upper division courses for us are still up in the air but they are prepping for everything online. \n\nLike some other folks pointed out you can always not sign up for classes thats true, or you could simply just do easier or GE courses online in the fall. But if you have an in, take it now while you still have it",

Whether or not classes for one semester end up being online is immaterial.  College is more than just taking classes.",

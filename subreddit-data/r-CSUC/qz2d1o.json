Our anthro lab helps with actual human identification for the county. Here's two articles about it:\n\n[https://www.actionnewsnow.com/content/news/Chico-State-Anthropology-Dept-helps-identify-Camp-Fire-victims-563191391.html](https://www.actionnewsnow.com/content/news/Chico-State-Anthropology-Dept-helps-identify-Camp-Fire-victims-563191391.html) \n\n[https://today.csuchico.edu/the-search-for-what-remains/](https://today.csuchico.edu/the-search-for-what-remains/) \n\nWe have the largest forensic anthropology lab in the west. \n\nAlso, not anthropology, but paleontology related: we're one of only a few universities that is federally sanctioned to store fossils. We are curating one of the largest fossil discoveries in Northern California that was discovered just in the last year. Our campus museum has them on display. The first mastodon find in the last 70 years. \n\n[https://www.csuchico.edu/geos/stories/miocene-fossil-finds.shtml](https://www.csuchico.edu/geos/stories/miocene-fossil-finds.shtml)",

Good luck! I was a transfer student for Fall 2021. It just takes time. And honestly Chico state has been accepting almost 92% off applicants since our numbers have gone down from covid (when I applied it was a 62% acceptance rate) I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine the requirement to transfer in to the school is a 2.0-2.3 for some majors. And since you\u2019re a transfer they add 2 gpa points for their calculations. I graduated with an AS in business from a CC with a 2.1 gpa but my transfer Gpa was 2.3 and was the min gpa I needed to get in to my degree program which is BSIS.",

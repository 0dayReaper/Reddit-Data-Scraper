            "comment": "From the other areas I've been near colleges. This place is pretty safe.\n\nJust a few tips if you want to better guarantee 0 issues.\n\n- don't live near Nord and \"The Zoo\"\n\n- don't leave visible valuables in your car, especially if you're in an apartment complex with mostly college students.\n\n- if you're a lady, don't walk around downtown or college-student-dense areas at night\n\n- if you're a lady, watch your drink, don't trust bar people, leave with your group\n\n- UPD is useless except for fist fights, call Chico Police instead.\n\nMost people don't have a problem and are able to just enjoy it. Chico is a beautiful town with a great mix of easy-access parks, nice restaurants, chill people. We get an influx of college kids twice a year, and that brings more chaos.\n\n\nSome of this might sound like I'm blaming college students for an increase in crime. That's not the case. Easy-to-find, heavily drunken people, is going to attract the attention of bad people as well. That's why I'd recommend you try not to live near too many other college students (if you move here) and take precautions if you do",

Gated parking lot with several pedestrian gates, so it helps counter theft. \n\nPersonally, never had anything happen to my truck or apartment, and as much as I remember there were no break ins or thefts in the parking lot. \n\nAlso decent rent price for todays world and it\u2019s walking distance from campus, took me about 10-15 min to get to Glenn, depending if I had to wait for the train to pass.",

Whispering Trees apartments were a walk / long board trip away. Quiet, no security issues, decently priced. A little old though but what are ya gonna do.",

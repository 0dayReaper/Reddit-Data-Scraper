I do not know if they made a mistake. I want to know what this program offers before I apply or not. What is the difference between Honors Housing and regular on-campus housing?\n\nEdit: My major will be CS",

            "comment": "The Honors program lets you take certain interdisciplinary classes that fulfill GE requirements. If you do upper decision honors GE, staying in the program all of undergrad, you have to take a thesis class and do a project. I\u2019ve currently in my second honors class at Chico, and I really love the program. It\u2019s challenged me more academically than my other GE classes, and I love the people I\u2019ve met in the program. You can also look into staying in Honors housing, which is in the top two floors of Sutter, the newest dorm on classes. I\u2019d recommend it if you\u2019re up for a bit of a challenge, can motivate yourself, and want classes that have multiple areas of focus in one class. Feel free to message me if you wanna talk more about it!",

Honors housing is great if you like a chiller environment too. The connections with other honors students is one of the biggest pluses for me, and the early registration is nice too :)",

            "comment": "I highly recommend it. The program offers some really interesting classes that are honestly the same amount of work/less work than other GE classes (based on conversations I\u2019ve had with friends). Priority registration is a blessing, especially if you have a competitive major/have work or other activities you want to plan around. Honors housing was fantastic, I\u2019m still close friends with about half the people on my floor and since I\u2019m still in the honors program I still have class with a bunch of them. \n\nFor qualifying, I know they also look at GPA and ACT score so maybe you qualified through that?\n\nIf you have any more specific questions feel free to DM me!",

Although, Chico sounds like its winters are somewhat wetter than ours. I got accepted right before the quarentine so i just hope it doesnt mess with my current classes and my enrollment for fall",

Whitney is \u201csocial\u201d as in the most balls to the wall people you can find in the freshman class, I\u2019ve had more friends hate Whitney than like, but it depends on who you are. Sutter is the exact opposite, quiet (most of the time). Honors housing is located in Sutter so it\u2019s a lot of study time during weeks. Shasta and Lassen are classic red bricks (literally look up red brick dorms and it\u2019s all the same) I lived in shasta and loved it, it\u2019s the middle ground, people respect quiet hours and focus on study time, but aren\u2019t afraid to blast music and get wasted and talk to others in the halls.\n\nDinning hall food is fine. You aren\u2019t going to a Michelin star restaurant, but it\u2019s good enough that you don\u2019t abhor it. And if you ever get bored of it, the food around town is REALLY good.",

Not sure about the residence area but since the school is in the downtown anytime you dont feel like eating at the dining hall you still have tons of options. Also the quesadillas they make at the bmu are pretty great.",

In the dorms you don't have to worry about the climate much, but off campus there're lots of places with swamp coolers.  Avoid those whenever possible - when it gets really hot they don't do any good.\n\nI can't speak to the residence halls since I never lived in one.  People have their favorites but mostly it's the luck of the draw.  A good/bad roommate will make or break your on-campus experience.  Thankfully, there's lots of room to avoid each other if that's the case.  I lived at UV, and I have family in UV right now.  We liked the apartment style living better than the dorms. \n\nI hear the residence hall food is decent enough for cafeteria food.  I'm disappointed by the dinning facilities at the student union.  It's better than the cafeteria but since it's a private for-profit company managing those restaurants I'd expect better.  Don't worry though... there are a dozens of nice places to eat within a mile from campus.  Many cater to students and are located right off campus.",

If you're used to home cooked meals, you might have some complaints, but compared to what you get at some other schools, it's great.",

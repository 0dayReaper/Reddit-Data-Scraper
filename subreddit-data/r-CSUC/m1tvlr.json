    "postText": "So I know that the campus is technically closed and that tours aren't happening right now but I was wondering if I could just like show up and have a look and feel for the campus as I'm considering transferring here next semester. I just feel like virtual tours aren't the same as going in-person. Also if anyone has any recommendations of places to eat or check out while I'm there it would be greatly appreciated!",

Of course it will feel a little weird without many people on campus, (you may see a few people walking around), you will still get a good look at what it looks like.\n\nYou should check out Upper Bidwell Park for sure",

Recommend Celestinos for a slice of pizza (it's so close to campus it may as well be part of the school) and also meandering all around downtown to get a feel for it too. Lots of little restaurants nearby. Bidwell Park is always a big draw, especially if you bring a bike with you.",

            "comment": "I graduated 5 years ago, and started CSUC in 2010.  Covid obviously changes a lot, but for the sake of sharing my own experiences I won't factor that into my suggestions.\n\n1. Love the schoolwork - There is a difference between putting in enough effort to get the easy B and sometimes the easy A, and going above and beyond to actually learn something and build yourself as a respectable sharp young person.  Always sit in front of the class, study in the library at least 5 days of the week, and go to office hours.\n2. Love the city - Chico is a great place to live.  As a freshman, don't confine yourself to campus, downtown, and the grocery store.  Go to the park, visit the stores, try the food all over the city, ride the trails, see the concerts, see the local theater.  Those friends that I had that never left their rooms hated their Chico experience.\n3. Learn moderation with your alcohol consumption.  Most college students drink.  Most between the ages of 18-21 go too hard too often.  If you're going to drink, learn to have a couple drinks, then say no and call it a night by midnight.  On the note of health, get lots of exercise by lifting, running, or riding a bike.\n4. Pick your friends carefully - Most likely your friends will be those in your major.  I was friends with exactly zero of my previous dorm friends by the time i hit year 3.  In your major, you'll have the jackasses and the bright people.  Be friends with the bright people who are of good character and work hard.  Those people will give you personal and professional relationships well after you graduate.  On the opposite end I knew bright people in the dorms who became friends with the party/fraternity crowd that crashed and burned and were gone from the school after the first year.\n\nGood luck.",

Check out all the fun outdoor activities/places like hiking in upper park and chilling down at one mile. Eat at the local restaurants, and just follow your gut and do what feels right for a good balance of living and exploring life and also passing your classes because nobody wants to retake a class or end up on academic probation.",

Cannot say how greatly it has affected my college experience and it has introduced me to so so many people and I have memories that I\u2019ll love forever. Don\u2019t overload yourself with units, if you have to take more than 15 a semester try and work into using summer/winter session. A bike is awesome for cruising around chico but be sure to get tire locks and be very careful, crackheads are brazen when it comes to bike theft. Party hard, study harder.",

Surround yourself with people that are smarter than you, have different perspectives than you, and genuinely care about you. A lot of growth in college comes from the people you hang out with, don't waste your time on Chad who just wants to go to frat parties every night.\n4. Get a part time job second sememster. It helps with time management, looks great on your resume for when you graduate and are looking for a career, and the extra cash will really come in handy. \n5. Explore the local community. Bidwell park, the Sacramento river, downtown Chico, etc. are awesome.\n6. Enjoy every second of it. The memories I made in Chico are something I will cherish forever.

            "comment": "I like u/nakfoor\u2019s list. \n\nI\u2019ll throw mine on here in the same spirit, I graduated in 2017 (attended at a later age graduating at 30)\n\n1. Don\u2019t let your whole experience revolve around parties. That\u2019s an easy black hole to get sucked into. There can be a lot to do around here if you look for it. \n\n2. Invest yourself in whatever degree program you\u2019re most passionate about, but don\u2019t pressure yourself to have that figured out on the first day. \n\n3. Take the time to get to know your professors and build friendships with them the best you can. Not only is that a good thing in its own right, but you never know how it could lead to professional connections later. \n\n4. Try to minimize the financial impact. Find inexpensive places to rent, if you have family in the area maybe consider moving in with them if they are up for it. Don\u2019t eat out too much or spend too much on booze. The less debt you graduate college with the better, trust me. You don\u2019t want to be financially hamstrung for the first 5-10 years after graduating when you\u2019re trying to launch a career. \n\n5. Once you\u2019ve settled in and you know what you\u2019re majoring in, check out what kind of organizations and clubs might be active on campus that involve that major. For example, I was a Media Arts major and joined the Digital Filmmakers Guild, which basically shows future employers you have a real interest in your work and you wanted to do more than just class projects. \n\n6. Find a part time job off campus if you can. Not only does it help you financially but it also offers you a small chance with the community that is hosting you for the next 4+ years. \n\n7. Respect the city. Remember that 90,000+ people call this place home all year and they will still be here if and when you move away. So keep that in mind when you\u2019re doing things that could have an impact on the larger community. Even partying or going to a community event can leave a mark, so just always be aware of that and try to see this town through the locals eyes. \n\nEnjoy your time!",

It\u2019s probably different now with regulations and social media, however, I have no regrets and it was paramount to my college experience. \n\nAlso, I am still in contact with my sorority sisters today.  It\u2019s also a great way to network in the real world being a apart of a fraternity/sorority.  \n\nDownside is, it\u2019s very time consuming and it\u2019s not free.  Also, we had mandatory socials \u201cthemed parties\u201d every Thursday night and I NEVER made it to class on Friday.  You have to learn how to balance it along with not failing out of Chico.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a freshman at UC Merced and next year I'm either going to be transferring to Chico or doing Community College. Anyways I've heard horror stories about the Chico dorms being very Prison like. No outside guests, cameras, guards, etc. I'd like to be able to have my girlfriend visit me every so often and have other visitors. \n\nAre all the dorms like this or only some of them? I wouldn't mind doing off campus apartments but I also want to meet new people at Chico. I've heard mixed things about The Social apartments which initially looked very enticing. Also I haven't even started the housing application process but you think they would put me with sophomores or incoming freshman?",

There are cameras from what I remember and we were allowed guest as long as they only stayed for I think 3 days? Something like that. Anywho as for the actual dorms there definitely weren\u2019t guards or anything like that but you do have to check in with the RAs when having someone over (have to do this at UV too but it\u2019s honestly easy not because of the overall set up), and do that each time you go in and out of the building. I haven\u2019t lived on campus since covid happened (I only got a semester and a half at UV before covid happened and we were all sent home) so I\u2019m not sure how the rules or regulations have changed but I can assume it\u2019s not by that much especially now that covid restrictions such as no mask or vaccinations are needed to go to class, etc. as for your placement being with freshman vs sophomores I think you\u2019d just get randomly placed. When I was on campus the second semester we had transfer students living with us who were in their junior and senior years while the majority of us were only freshmen so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any specificities with that.",

    "postText": "Im struggling hard in Diff. Equations and I don't know if I can pass at this point. I know I can still withdrawal from the class as the date has been extended but would it be better to withdrawal soon or just fail the class so that I can make it up with academic forgiveness? This class is a requirement so I'll need to take it again regardless, but I guess the question is, is it better to have a Withdrawal on my transcript or have the class noted as Repeated?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor anyone in a similar situation, my advisor said to take the withdrawal instead of a No Credit because some colleges or potential employers see a withdrawal as simply dropping the class and a No Credit as a failing grade. Chico state basically recognizes both as the same thing and neither impact your GPA, but it ultimately came down to which one would look better on your transcript  ",

Oftentimes repeat classes are taken as an average of the original attempt and repeat grade (e.g. F + A= C [hopefully]).\n\nIn that case, academic advising will give you all the info you need on withdrawal concerns. I don\u2019t think a withdrawal is the worst thing in the world. Right now, it\u2019s completely understandable and sometimes necessary.",

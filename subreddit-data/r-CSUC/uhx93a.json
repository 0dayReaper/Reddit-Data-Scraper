Besides, you might be better off rethinking what sort of value college has for you if these are your priorities.\n\nMany of the fraternities here have strict academic guidelines and are involved in community projects. On the other side of that coin however, you do have the all-party, no-study ones with students who have been enrolled for seven years because they're too busy partying to earn Bachelor's degrees. The frats like the agriculture one are there to help students succeed.\n\nSo what are you going to Chico for? Is it the programs? The people? Or is it because of a stereotype that the school's been distancing itself from for years now?",

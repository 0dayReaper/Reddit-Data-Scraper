Many dm's get ignored, so I'm posting again.\n\nI need help figuring out how to sign up for classes, and what classes I would need to start off with. I'm transfering in and will start as a junior. I'm majoring in CAGD. I completed all my general ed and am just finishing up the classes I need for my AA at my local college. I'm able to search for classes but I don't have access to enrollment yet as I don't think it has opened up yet (but it has at my local college for Summer and Fall). Also, I have a disability, and I have priority registration at my jr college; so I emailed the ARC but any additional advice is welcome. Just struggling with online classes as I do not do well in them.",

            "comment": "You should be given an opportunity to attend some kind of orientation. I'm sure they haven't figured out how they're gonna do that yet with everything being closed. Typically, during the orientation you would meet with faculty related to your major that will help you pick out what classes you should take. Transfer students can only enroll in classes during their orientation time and then a few weeks before the start of classes (when it's open for everyone).\n\n(I also transferred. This is how it was done when I transferred for FA 2018 and when my friends transferred for FA 2019. YMMV because of COVID-19)\n\n[Here is the catalog for all classes you need to take that are specific to the BS in CAGD](http://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/20/CAGD/APCGNONEUN.html). You will also need to complete your general ed stuff - [here's a link to the pathway info](http://catalog.csuchico.edu/viewer/20/GENED.html). For both your major classes and your GE classes you'll need to figure out how your classes will transfer over. If you're transferring in from a public California college then [assist.org](https://assist.org/) can help you with that. \n\nIf you have completed ALL of your lower division general ed courses then you need to take some upper division general ed courses. They're on the very bottom of the last page of the GE planning sheet. Pick one column (Diversity Studies, Food Studies, etc..) and take one course from each section of that column. You might have exceptions for one of the sections (example: Math has an exception of UD-B because of Methods of Proofs, Math 330). You'll also want to consider what writing courses you need to take. Your freshman level composition/english course should cover one writing class, CAGD 345W counts as a second and is required for your major, so you need to find 2 more that have a W next to their name or talk to a grad advisor to see if any of your transfer classes would count.\n\nThere are two major academic plans (MAPs) that can help you if you need some structure: [MAP for CAGD with a focus on Animation](https://www.csuchico.edu/aap/_assets/documents/computer-anim.pdf) | [MAP for CAGD with a focus on Game Design](https://www.csuchico.edu/aap/_assets/documents/computer-anim-game-dev.pdf). Since you've transferred in with (presumably) courses already completed you'll need to figure out what those courses are and cross them off, figure out what courses are left that you need to do prereqs for, and then organize a plan based off of that. It's the same stuff you'd have to do without the MAP, but the MAP gives you an idea of what it would look like.\n\nYou can also go to the student center via the portal and click on \"Smart Planner\" which should help you get an idea of what classes you need to take, but if CSUC doesn't have an idea of what courses you've completed already it won't be much help yet.",

Will help you so much to make a personalized schedule and keep yourself on track. Also do your own planning when you go in for your official last of semester. I know it seems like a lot but will help so much the advisors at Chico are not always great. And the general advisors can\u2019t really do anything for you after sophomore year unless you haven\u2019t completely finished GEs. But make sure they are all done. Good luck!!",

However because they will be teaching the classes this individual is in, they will have loads of time for questions then and there!",

Go through the Chico course catalog and schedule and pick out specific courses (and alternates) to fulfill these unmet requirements.... as you're choosing them, note the semesters when each course is offered (Spring or Fall) and the prerequisites for the course.\n\nNow go through your list of desired courses and arrange them according to their prerequisites... which courses do you have to take before you can take others?  Be sure to include your alternate courses too.\n\nFinally you can build a schedule for each semester by selecting courses from your list.  Choose a good selection of both major and general ed courses, with the goal of taking roughly 15 units/semester.  Include your alternate course choices also... when you go to sign up for classes each semester, if your first choice is full, you'll have a viable alternate you can choose instead.\n\n\nYour course registration window will be posted in your Student Center/Portal account each semester.",

Obviously everything is weird because of the pandemic but I was in your shoes a year ago and for both animation and GD the first semester or so look almost identical. \n\nYou will have a type of orientation at some point near the end of the semester, this will introduce the instructors and the program lead (Mr Clarke) will go over your classes you have done and you can pick your classes then. Dont be afraid of getting all the ones you need as lower division courses are set up for larger groups anyways. Your first semester will probably look a little like this: 170 Game Developement, 180 Computer Graphics Programming, 110 Computer Assisted Art, 112 Digital Photography and 117 Storyboard Design. But this is all subject to change.\n\n\nThat being said I am not certain anyone can actually sign up for fall classes currently. Summer classes are open, though it may just be for returning students. Anyways shoot me a message and I will try and help you find what info you are looking for.",

I have every right to be disatisfied and upset with my country when at every turn the people in power try to fuck me over a little bit more and then a little bit more after and it just continues and continues. Just look at the current situation. It revealed how fragile our current system is. How inept and easily broken it is when even just a single cog fails to turn. This country isn' able to sustain itself and I rather get what I can and get out rather than stay here and collapse with everything else. Big multibillion dollar multinational corporation cant even pay their employees through a crisis or survive for a month with all the money their executives and shareholders hoard. So we had to do another fucking bailout because these idiots are crashing the economy every decade for the advancement of their personal wealth. Then they buy up all the broken pieces and do it again. And where does that leave regular people like us? It leaves us at their mercy, to get fucked over harder next time. I'm not gonna get a bachelors just to barely make it in a country that is supposedly extremely rich, whose whole premise is that if you work hard you can get somewhere and make something of yourself. No, I rather cut my loses and move somewhere more secure and stable, but we will see what happens in the next two years if such a plan is even warrented.",

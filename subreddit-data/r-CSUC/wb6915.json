            "comment": "Yep! Some classes are also common sense so it\u2019s not worth it to spend 30/40 bucks on a text book.also some professors might wait until class starts to let you know they\u2019ll give you free access. If you truly need the books, chegg has great deals on pdf and hard copy rental books! Also wait to see if you teacher uses homework software like McGraw hill because those come with and online textbook when you pay for the homework software. They also sometimes throw in energy shots or little snacks with your order!",

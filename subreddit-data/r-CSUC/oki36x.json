So bad so, in fact, that someone jumped over a brick wall at my old work and lifted a bike back over it while we were all inside working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake sure you have your bike locked up, and make sure it's a U-lock (not something that can be easily cut through)",

If it\u2019s not as nice as other bikes, use multiple locks to make it as inconvenient as possible to steal. The Mountain biking at Bidwell is top tier, and there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to lock your bike up near downtown if you want to go out.",

Definitely bring a bike but also make sure to bring an excellent lock and don't leave your bike in public overnight locked up or not. Bike theft is a whole ass trade here. I once had someone put a second lock on my bike while I was in class. Campus PD said it was likely someone who planned on coming back later to grab it or someone thought it was their bike that had been stolen. A good reason to also register your bike to avoid any confusion. Happy biking!\n\n\nEdit: fat fingers",

Also since the freshman parking lot is pretty limited, a majority of freshman don\u2019t have a car if they\u2019re living on campus. So if you want to go anywhere farther than where you can walk, I\u2019d highly recommend a bike. Just make sure to bring a U-Lock, theft is huge",

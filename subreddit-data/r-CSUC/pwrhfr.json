    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone has taken either KINE beginning weight training classes? There is the regular co-ed class KINE 166A for Beginning Weight Training. Then there's KINE 166V, Beginning Weight Training specifically for women. I'm a girl, and would like to take the female weight training class, but it might not fit into my schedule. Have any girls taken the co-ed class? Or any girls who have taken the woman's class? Were your experiences comfortable and positive? I'm worried I would be intimidated by guys in the class.  I'm new to exercising and and I would feel more comfortable in a class with all girls. I'm curious what other people's experiences are in these classes.",

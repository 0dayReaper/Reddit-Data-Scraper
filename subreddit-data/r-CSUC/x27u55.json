So if you finish in 4 years, that will be 8 semesters. So $4000 x 8 = $32000. $32000 tuition for all students for 4 years of full class load.\n\nSince you're international, you will be paying an additional $6000 per semester. So $6000 x 8 = $48000. This is the additional amount you pay as an international student over 4 years. \n\nSo 4 years (8 semesters) of full course load would cost you $32000 (base tuition) + $48000 (fee for international) = $80000. \n\nCalifornian residents help fund the California State University (CSU) system through taxes, which is why it is discounted for us. You have to pay the full cost without the discount. It will be the same at basically every state school in the US.",

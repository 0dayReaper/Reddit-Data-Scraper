    "postText": "I'm leaning towards Mac because of the durability and speed, but the only thing that makes me hesitant is that I won't be able to run bare metal Linux on it. Should I prioritize the hardware that a Mac has or look into something that can run Linux bare metal for the software experience?",

            "comment": "I got through my CS degree on an old hand-me-down MacBook from 2014, tbh it worked quite well (graduated in 2021). It was able to handle running an Ubuntu VM on it without too much issues. The biggest challenge for me was simply lack of disk space, I only had 256GB of storage and I was constantly running into issues with not being able to install packages and whatnot. If I could have had a laptop with 1TB of storage or more, it would have been perfect\n\nPlus you can develop iOS apps on it if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in\n\nThough you could absolutely get through the program on cheaper hardware if you need to. None of the courses require anything particularly demanding on hardware",

Any computer would work, really, as long as it has at least 8GB of RAM and a semi-decent processor. On the other hand, a Linux VM would suffice for everything you do here, so running bare metal Linux isn\u2019t necessary. It honestly just comes down to personal preference.",

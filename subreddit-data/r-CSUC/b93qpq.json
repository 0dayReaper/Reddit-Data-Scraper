    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m transferring to Chico is Fall 2019.\nWhen is registration for classes open? I checked my portal and it says I do not have access to enrollment at this time. I called Admissions and they had told me that my schedule will be planned at Summer Orientation but I want to know when the registration process is actually open. Also, is there any way for me to receive early registration? I really don\u2019t want to be late on that because I need my classes. Thanks in advance. ",

If you don't attend the orientation, I believe class registration opens a couple weeks later (which is how they encourage students to attend orientation).\n\n&gt;  Also, is there any way for me to receive early registration?\n\nYes.  Registering during summer orientation IS the early registration.\n\n\n&gt;  because I need my classes\n\nEveryone does.  You're not unique.",

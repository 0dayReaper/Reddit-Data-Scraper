    "postText": " \n\nI got accepted by Chico for Fall 2020. I was wondering if any of you could give some advice on whether or not I should attend Chico this fall, or why I should choose Chico over Sac State or Monterey Bay. For some background, I'm from a small town in SoCal and am transferring from a community college. I was gonna visit the schools before making my decision but I obviously can't do that anymore\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s been awhile since I attended but I\u2019m originally from a large town in So Cal and Chico was such an awesome place to live and go to school. The campus is fairly compact and easy to get around. Downtown has some awesome bars and places to hang out. The Greek system is phenomenal. There is a creek running through campus. It\u2019s a very beautiful campus as well. It\u2019s truly a college experience. A genuine community.\n\nI don\u2019t think I would move across the state to attend Sac State. I\u2019ve never been, but believe it\u2019s a commuter school like Fullerton, San Bernardino and Long Beach (mostly all Cal States are commuter schools).\n\nI don\u2019t know much about Monterey Bay, so I cannot even begin to comment.\n\nI originally started at Long Beach State and transferred to Chico as a Junior. One thing that stood out and newer students can maybe chime in here, but during the winter session, you used to be able to take a 3 unit course and it was included with spring tuition. At Long Beach you could take a 3 unit course, but you had to go through University Extension and they charged you an additional charge for the class (per unit). That was such a great value in my opinion.",

If those Winter session classes we charged at the per unit rate, I could see they wouldn\u2019t be cheap at all. Man, now I\u2019m bummed out hearing that.\n\nI appreciate you clarifying that for both the OP and myself.",

            "comment": "\nUltimately, I agree with what another poster said in the CSUS subreddit. I would call the journalism departments and see if their goals for their students align with yours. You (hopefully) won\u2019t be in college forever so I think it\u2019s important to consider to what capacity your school is setting you up for success. The departments would probably love to hear from a potential student and answer all the questions you have. I changed majors a few times and wish I talked to more advisers/faculty, even after I settled on my major. \n\nI  attended Chico and it really ended up working out for me. The campus is really nice and there\u2019s plenty of room to find a social niche. There\u2019s also a wonderful, huge park to adventure in about a 10 minute drive from campus. Hiking/running/mountain biking/swimming holes/good for photos/dogs. It gets pretty hot in the summers and can get chilly in the winters (no snow). \n\nI grew up in Sacramento and used to run around the campus during sports practice. It\u2019s a nice campus with a lot of big trees and to me does not feel like it\u2019s in a big city on its own. I\u2019d say in general it\u2019s more of a commuter school than Chico, which some prefer. Most students at Chico live within walking/biking distance.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for Monterrey, sorry, hopefully someone can elaborate a bit on it. \n\nOf course many places socially it can be what you make it so YMMV. \n\nGood question and good luck!",

            "comment": "I lived in Monterey for two years. I will say that Monterey is more expensive than Chico, but it's far more beautiful and a much nicer place to live. The weather is mild year round, albeit foggy. Lots of tourism, but it's easy to stay away from the tourist trap areas. It's definitely a small town, much smaller than Chico, but all of the \"stuff\" (Target, chain restaurants, Home Depot) are there. You will need a car if you don't have one. The scenery is jaw dropping and the town is sleepy and very safe.\n\n\nI came to Chico for a variety of reasons, but if I were 21 again and the had the choice, I'd definitely go to Monterey. Just go to Google maps, drop the little orange dude down by Lover's Point, and take a little \"walk\" by the bay. You could do that every single day. Chico is a nice place all things considered but I am constantly looking for a way to get back to Monterey.",

Chico is primarily a college town - everywhere you go you can assume a good portion of the people you see will also be students your age and open to meeting new people.   The average people you see in Monteray (families/tourists) or Sacramento (all age ranges but mainly locals from the area) aren't going to have as much in common for you and you won't really get the true college feel.\n\nThe difference between the actual education/how people view a degree is not going to really matter at all compared to things like jobs, volunteering, projects, etc. you've done.\n\nI loved Chico because it's sort of in the middle of nowhere but then you drive into town and it's filled with bars, restaurants, parks, etc. and the whole town was people my age out having a good time.  Meet a cute girl at the bar?  She probably lives within a 15 minute walk of you and you'll see her around on campus.",

I have a lot of friends who went to Sac State for a bit, and from what I heard, it's really hard to meet people in that area of you don't start there as a freshman. As a Sacramento local, there is a lot to do in Sacramento. \n\nI think you should contact the heads of each college to ask about stuff. Most should videochat you to talk about the programs and the extra opportunities offered.",

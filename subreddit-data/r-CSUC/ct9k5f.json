I advise making the drive down here a couple days before so you know where you're going.\n\nROUTE:\n\nStarts at Irvine Finch River Access Road  (Hwy 32 W @ Sacramento River)\n\nEnds at Scotty's Landing Bar &amp; Grill  12609 River Rd, Chico, CA 95973\n\nRULES:\n\n\\- buddy system.  Every year there are multiple assaults.  Given the crowd its a small % but remember there is virtually no police presence on the ground.  They patrol in boats but the small river beaches make it feel like you're at a sold out concert.  There're lots of out of towners who don't appreciate the local scene and with hormones and booze it's easy for things to go wrong.\n\n\\- no obvious alcohol containers or glass\n\n\\- get two cars, drop off &amp; pick up or plan a DD to meet you at the exit\n\n\\- BRING A VALVE STEM REMOVER for your tube so you can quickly deflate it.\n\n\\- DON'T LITTER.  DONT LITTER!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: protect your feet, wear strap on sandals or river shoes.  You'll have a shitty end of the day if you're walking around Scotty's barefoot - or get so wasted you try walking back to town barefoot like my exgf did.",

It\u2019s not okay to slack off, because the student next to you isn\u2019t, and you\u2019re increasing their chances of getting in, versus you. You\u2019re the defining factor of your own future. Put in the work, try to learn another language if you don\u2019t know one already, try to get maybe a CNA license or EMT if you\u2019re old enough. Don\u2019t forget to take a chill pill every now and then, because you\u2019ll hate yourself and your life if you don\u2019t. Pre-nursing is easily more stressful and competitive than nursing itself.",

If anything, keep your GPA at least at a 3.75! I\u2019m currently at a 3.73 and one class could have gotten me that extra point. Remember EVERYTHING counts and one little point is the difference between you and the next person getting in.",

Admissions into the nursing program is extremely difficult and is no joke. Make sure you take your academics seriously and don\u2019t fall into the pit of procrastination for those classes. Good luck!",

I ask because I don't want to put in my application and pay the housing fees and be expected to uproot myself and move 300 miles with all the things I need. The housing dept has not emailed me back when I asked them this question last week.",

I don't know how many people have been kicked out so far this year, but traditionally they don't have much room for new residents in the middle of a semester. At the semester mark, many first year students drop out when they realize they have straight F's and so then there are openings.  \n\nIf your payment is for the Spring 2022 semester, then you can't live there prior to January 2022.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm hoping to transfer next fall and realized that transfer students can only go to UV, or at least that's the case according to the person I talked to in the housing department. Does anyone have any insight on how UV is compared to just getting my own apartment? Since it seems like a not-so-great combination of dorm and apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother question for anyone else who transferred, what was your GPA going in since obviously they say they require a 2.0 or higher but was wondering what GPA I would need to kinda ensure admission. Currently at a 3.0, thanks a bunch.",

So if you failed class's a while back that will make it harder, but not impossible. Since you have a 3.0 you should be rock solid. As for once your in, they mainly focus on GPA earned in classes there. Obviously you should be fine so long as you show up and actually try, that has been my experience for the general Ed classes at least.",

            "comment": "lots of apartment options are fine, the one downside is most apartments if your roommate is a flake, doesn't pay bills whatever- that ends up being your problem.  I had several experiences with roommates who just decided they were not gonna keep going to school and just dropped out and bailed, sticking me with paying the full rent unless I dragged their asses to court, which isn't really viable.  \n\nThe one advantage of dorms is your roommate situations are more managed.",

If you want to get your own studio I recommend Westpark Plaza, last time I was there it was $750/mo for your own studio, and the staff was super friendly. They're a 20 min walk to campus.",

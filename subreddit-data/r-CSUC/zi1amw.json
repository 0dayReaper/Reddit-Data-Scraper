I recently transferred here as a computer science major -- most people in the department are really nice and easy to get along with.  \n\nThe program is excellent, and likely a bit tougher than community college; so if you have any free time, I recommend that you proactively study up on topics you will be learning in the upcoming semester, for example, computer networking and data structures &amp; algos.  \n\nI will send you a PM with an invite to the CSCI/CINS discord where you can talk with alumni and faculty and receive news about events for clubs and career fairs, etc.",

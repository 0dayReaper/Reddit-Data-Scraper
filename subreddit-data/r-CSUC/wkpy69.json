    "postText": "As the new school year starts we have already heard several incoming students being pulled over for driving the wrong way down the many one way streets here in town. Please pay attention if you are new to the area, there was almost a head on collision today because someone was going the wrong way, not a good way to start the new school year.",

Since moving to Chico a year ago (I\u2019m from the bay)  I\u2019ve been almost hit more times than I can remember by other stupid college kids (I\u2019m a college kid myself) because they go 40+ down residential areas, do \u201cCalifornia stops\u201d , don\u2019t use turn signals, and ride peoples tails. This is a small town with a LARGE student population and growing population in general. You\u2019re in a small town, drive like it.",

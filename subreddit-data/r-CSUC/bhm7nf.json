    "postText": "Hello all! Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone knew anything about the anthropology masters program at Chico? How competitive it is? The size? How intense it is? I\u2019m mainly interested in going into forensics and I know Chico has a human identification lab.\n\nI\u2019m finishing up my undergrad at University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a double major in anthropology and psychology and Chico is on my list of potential grad schools, I just wanted to see if anyone knew anything about it or maybe this is just an undergrad subreddit lol sorry\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hey I just graduated as an undergrad in Anthro, but I know a lot of grad students! The masters program for forensic anthropology is VERY competitive because there is extremely limited space in the ID lab and the actual Anthro department is underfunded to some degree. The human ID lab takes on 150-200 cases per year, but it is lacking a lot of newer equipment because the lab's budget is very small. If you don't have prior lab experience at your previous college, you most likely won't be accepted because that's a crucial piece of experience the professors who run the ID lab are looking for. I'd recommend applying to larger Forensic Anthro programs at other universitities that are better funded &amp; have larger labs",

Are there any music program horror stories that I should be aware of? (I\u2019m currently a music education major at a small liberal arts college in central Massachusetts, for reference.)",

As of now, we are looking for a new band director for the fall of 2020, and the music program can always use more students!\nChico is a great place for a music education degree with very successful results with students getting jobs after college. Most of the band programs in the area have teachers who went through Chico.",

With just a BA in music, would you meet the qualifications to teach (in which state?) or do you also need a teaching credential?\n\nWhat is your fallback plan if you find out teaching isn't right for you?\n\nI have a friend from high school who got his BA in music right out of high school then came back 10 years later for a BS in computer science due to lack of jobs.\n\nNone of these questions are specific to Chico's program, but they're things you should think hard about before pursuing your \"passion\" as a career.",

I\u2019m going to be taking 2/3 of the Massachusetts licensing tests this summer, which I\u2019ve been told by my advisors are good in a lot of states. More likely than not, I\u2019m going to go for a masters in the music education field as well. If schools cut music programs, which I pray they don\u2019t, I hope to teach to elementary aged kids. (Maybe in community centers, or even individual lessons.) If teaching doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll more likely than not continue with music, but more so in the performing or composing area.",

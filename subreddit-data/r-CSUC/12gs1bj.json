    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on enrolling this fall 2023 to CSUC and I\u2019ve been looking through various apartment complexes preferably student oriented but doesn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve got one roommate and will have 2 cats with me. Are there any pet friendly recommendations that are around ~1400$/monthly or anywhere from 700-750/person? I\u2019ve seen so many mixed reviews on places like Timber Creek, Village at the Timbers, and could really use some recommendations.",

They have a limit of 2 pets for $600 deposit for both, but they don't charge pet rent like other places. The place is a mix of students/families. Most of the packages go to the office, so they are safe. No washer/dryer on the unit, but they have a laundry room. The only issue is that they get full super quick, and I don't know if they might have spaces rn for fall 2023. If you have more questions, let me know.",

I was considering timber creek until I learned it was referred to as the zoo. I want somewhere affordable but not dirt cheap either, which I feel is reasonable for my budget. If I were to disregard the pets in the mix, What\u2019re some no pet apartments you\u2019d recommend? I forgot to mention that I\u2019d prefer furnished too.",

It is a relaxing quite environment for 2bedroom apartment at $690 per person per month. All of the apartments are renovated and have off street parking which you pay a little extra for.",

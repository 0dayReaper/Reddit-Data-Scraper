I saw that some people from other schools would do their dorm shopping online and send it to their dorm so it could be there by the time they move in and make things easier. Does anyone that has lived in UV before know if I could get away with doing this or will all my packages be sent back because there\u2019s too many/ too big???",

If you don\u2019t have another option I would call the housing office to see if they could hold it for you because that\u2019s where they\u2019re supposed to go in the summer since the mailroom is mainly staffed my students. For the problem of things being too big the usual thing is if it\u2019s too big to be carried we\u2019d lend you a cart, but the policy guide doesn\u2019t allow furniture so packages usually aren\u2019t that big.",

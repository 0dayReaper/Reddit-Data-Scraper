            "comment": "Living on campus is nice for a year but skippable if you're concerned about financials.  I think you just have to ask yourself how much responsibility you're ready to take on.  If you live off campus, you'll have to manage your utilities, grocery shopping, transportation, not wrecking the place, potentially have greater issues with roommates, and more vulnerability to petty crime.  You might also have to account for lease takeovers if you don't live in Chico year-round.  None of its particularly difficult, you'll just have to take on a little more responsibility.\n\nPersonally I found the \"meeting people' pro of living in the dorms to be non-existent.  I lost contact with all my friends from the dorms by the start of my third year at Chico State, and gained a completely new, better set of friends as I started taking more major-related courses.\n\nIn hindsight I could go either way on it.  Dorms were fun, but I could have lived just as easily somewhere else as a freshman.  If your family can't afford it financially, don't be too scared of living off campus.\n\nA house is always a good option if you can find one on Craigslist.  I lived at Pine Tree Apartments my 4th year.  It was safe, cheap, and close to campus.  Anything on Nord was a little wild when I was at Chico, I'd stay away from there.  The avenues close to Esplanade or south of downtown like 12th street and south have some quality college apartments.",

    "postText": "I got accepted into chico and was planning on attending there in the fall, given that school is even open, and I was wondering how the whole roommate process works. I have had a few friends and family members tell horror stories of their terrible roommates and was wondering how to help that not happen.",

There might be some exceptions but the faculty is being vaccinated right now and - if it's available - CSU might make a COVID vaccine a requirement to register for in person classes. \n\nFreshman roommate horror stories are part of the experience.  Don't worry, everyone's afraid it'll happen to them and leave a lifelong phobia of some kind.  Thankfully, the school has a process for resolving student resident conflicts - including moving someone into a new room.  \n\nI've never heard of someone having such a bad experience that they actually escalated the issue to a formally request a new residence.  Most of the time you just end up avoiding the other person .... the silver lining is it motivates you to get outside of your comfort zone, get outside and socialize - you might find someone amazing who lets you sleep at their place.   \n\nUniversity Village was where I spent my freshman year.  I loved it.  It wasn't the dorms.... it's like apartment living.  Having a shared community space allows people to have a little more bedroom privacy.  In the dorms - especially with roommates - people always end up sitting on beds because there's no room for chairs.  I always hated strangers in my bedroom.",

For finding an apartment, check out the Facebook group Chico State housing. The fall 2021 semester will be in person but who knows. They might change their mind.",

Try to setup boundaries and communicate with them if issues arise. I recommend meeting people at the dorms/in classes and then try and get an apartment with the ones you think you could live with.",

Every single person I know that lives on their own and not in the dorms their first year ended up not having a good time in Chico, mostly due to a lack of friends. It\u2019s extremely hard to find a good group of friends without living in the dorms. These are the people you\u2019ll be closest to the rest of your life. Even if your roommate is crap, you\u2019ll still have other neighbors you\u2019re around and you\u2019ll gravitate to the right folks for you.",

When I was in school, generally if someone looking for or to be a roommate could write a couple articulate paragraphs about themselves and what they value in a home, he or she would most likely be a decent person.  If you get emails like \"room still open?\", they probably don't put much effort or thoughtfulness into things.",

Asking because I want to get out of my comfort zone and join a frat.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "I transferred from souther California a couple years ago\n\n1) Chico is known to be hot for most of the year. A tshirt/tank top with shorts and sandals are best. Winters are a little cold, but preparing for it depends where you\u2019re from. As someone from southern CA, I\u2019m freezing in the winter. But I knew a girl from Minnesota who was fine in the cold\n\n2) join clubs to make friends. You will also make friends in class, but I\u2019ve had the most luck with clubs. \n\n3) from what I\u2019ve heard the frats are not that bad but it depends which one you join. I was never interested in Greek life so I couldn\u2019t tell you which ones are the \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d ones. If you hear anyone hint it\u2019s bad frat then don\u2019t join. \n\n4) there\u2019s not a lot of parking on campus so most people bike or walk to campus. You can get most places with a bike and you can Uber when you can\u2019t bike. I personally prefer a car but you can live here without one. Just know the drivers here are not great imo. \n\n5) can\u2019t answer the meal plan question but there are a lot of coffee shops on campus with good snacks to help wake you up before class. \n\n6) haven\u2019t been in a frat, but I am in a couple clubs. As long as you know how to manage yourself then you won\u2019t have a problem juggling clubs and school.",

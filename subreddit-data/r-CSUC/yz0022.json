    "postText": "Hello,\n\nFinishing college and moving away at the end of December. Looking for someone to take over my part of the lease from 1/1/2023-5/31/2023. Rent is $690 a month (+ PG&amp;E/Wifi) for a recently renovated unit at Pinetree Apartments. I've tried Facebook CSUC Housing Marketplace with no success.  The room is 11 \u00bd ft x 10 ft plus a closet. The bathroom is shared with the sole roommate but has separate sinks. A 15-minute walk to Chico State. Has a bike rack and parking ($50 per semester). In-unit washer and dryer. Onsite gym, pool, and BBQ. My current roommate (M, early 20s) is a Civil Engineering major. He prefers quiet and chill Individuals. 420 and alcohol friendly. The property is cat and dog-friendly (pet application required). Open to all genders. Perfect for someone trying to finish their final semester in a peaceful environment or transfer students.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jd3ukjw17t0a1.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86e7b4ba81dcb4600f22609ab2bb00a60c1d284f",

You might actually get a days notice and be there to help them when they show up. All of these things happened to my friends freshman year.",

I ended up having my own room for a little over a month. I pushed the beds together had my own bathroom/kitchen it was pretty sweet. I figured they would have someone moving in soon so I had someone across the hall I got along with well request to transfer to my room so I could avoid having a square roomate again.",

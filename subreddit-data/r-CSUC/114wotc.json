Like anywhere bad things can happen but in my opinion just make sure you\u2019re paying attention to your surroundings and try not to be by yourself in unlit places. But being a black male student I can only speak on my experience. Hope that helps.",

But you see a few ghetto people who there to get violent. You\u2019ll be ok if you stay away from them and don\u2019t get pulled into anything.",

Just be aware of your surroundings and watch your backpack, laptop, etc. Those are all things you have to do anywhere. Chico is a great fun place. You won\u2019t be a target if you don\u2019t make yourself a target. And that\u2019s true anywhere.",

I\u2019ve walked the entirety of town completely alone in the  middle of the night multiple times and been fine. Campus safety is top notch, lighting everywhere, blue boxes (emergency alarms) everywhere, and and sometimes CPD stationed in the main areas. Just use common sense.",

            "comment": "The most dangerous people in Chico are Chico State students themselves. Statistically they make up the majority of most violent crime in the city of Chico as well as sexual assaults. I have lived in Chico for 19 years and the majority of criminal activity I have experienced is derived from students from the Bay Area, Los Angeles County, Orange County and San Diego. I have witnessed this phenomenon where students refuse to assimilate into the Chico community and society which leads to overall criminality. As you are well aware, Chico is a college town in a rural northern California community with certain norms and traditions that are completely obliterated from people outside of the area. I have also noticed that a lot of the drug activity, particularly overdoses are from students peddling drugs at Chico State or with friends visiting students at Chico State. There is a small percentage of the local community who will pry on college students as a means to commit low-level property crimes but it would not be rampant in retrospect to other communities of its size in California.",

I\u2019m a Native American man, so I\u2019m not as easily targeted perhaps, as a man. I am sure things happen, as anywhere, but my experience has been that people are more kind and accepting, than threatening or concerning.",

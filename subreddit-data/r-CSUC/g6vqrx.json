    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone. So I have a question regarding the dorms. Recently in the Mini Orientation webinar yesterday, I had seen some people saying that they had already received emails stating that a bed has been reserved for them, essentially confirming that they got a spot in the dorms.   \nCan anyone confirm the validity of that, and help clarify how and when dorm confirmations are given out? I had contacted Housing but they misinterpreted my question as being about confirming that I completed a Housing application. I know that in May we get to choose our roommates and so I had started getting worried when I saw that others had already gotten spots. However, if spots are being slowly rolled out these last two weeks of April, then that is a small weight lifted off my shoulders.  \nThanks!",

            "comment": "Living off campus you have more privacy and freedom. I came in as a transfer. I pay $1180 (for a 2 bedroom 2 bath with my fianc\u00e9 (that\u2019s $590 a month) . You can find great studio apartments for about $900 a month and 1 bedrooms cost usually around $1000-1100 a month and 2 beds cost around $1200-1300 a month. If you get a 2 bedroom you can get a roommate and keep costs low. Off campus allows you to have whatever you want in your own place (you\u2019re not bound by the weird dorm rooms like no hot plate or candles for example) , you can cook whatever you want, have people over, decorate how you want, etc. you would just have to make an effort to be on campus a lot and join groups or clubs if making friends is very important for you. In my experience seeing friends live on campus through dorms or off campus dorms they pay a lot more for less. You can\u2019t really cook, can\u2019t drink, can\u2019t smoke, and you can\u2019t have pets , most of my friends had to pay extra for meal swipes etc. just remember if you live off campus you have to pay for your own internet, electricity, groceries . But being a college student you\u2019re income likely renders you on the lower income side meaning you qualify for discounts on your bills because you\u2019re a student and you could possibly qualify for cal fresh once you start paying your own bills and make less than a certain amount per month and the state will give you $250 a month for groceries. Pge offers the CARE credit which takes off like half your bill sometimes, Xfinity also offers the same type of program but it takes off about $30 a month on your internet bill (so you\u2019d pay at most like $50-80/month for internet. ) \n\nOut of everyone I\u2019ve ever met here at school they have said the only good thing about living in dorms is that you get to meet people. Other than that you actually have limited freedoms.And always remember the dorm system they pair you with a random roommate and you could honestly end up hating them or you guys could possibly not get along. Getting a roommate off campus you can find your own people and vet them and see if you like them before moving in with them.",

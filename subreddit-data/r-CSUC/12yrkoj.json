    "postText": "Hey guys! I am an incoming freshman and when I originally applied to CSUC, I intended to go into marketing, however i\u2019m really considering switching to a MIS major. Personally I think my personality is more suitable for Marketing, but I think it might be too broad of a degree. I think my success rate would be higher with a MIS degree, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d enjoy it. If anyone can give me advice that would be great!",

I originally used to be part of the business info systems pathway and MIS is good if you want to work in IT or cyber security or things along that line and you generally like working alone.\n\nMarketing may seem like a broad degree but you could say that about any degree. Make sure to get internships as much as you can. That\u2019s what matters . Do what you like and make connections, get internships and network, showcase your skills. Most companies just care that you have a piece of paper with your name on it but now look to see if you can do the job and have experience or are willing to learn.",

I\u2019m also not graduating for another year so it\u2019s a bit early for me to be applying for post grad jobs. And truthfully I probably won\u2019t be going in to working in marketing unless I get lucky as it is competitive and I don\u2019t have marketing experience. I\u2019m probably going to go back in to being a buyer or working in administrative positions which I have experience in",

With the MIS degree you have options of going into IT, Data Analyst/ Business Intelligence Analyst, Business Intelligence Engineer, or database management. In these positions you will still be collaborating with different stake holders. In my current job I collaborate with different stakeholders every day. Also, the MIS program is great at Chico State since we have companies like Chevron, EY, Deloitte, and few others that come to present at the BIS Society club, and we have few past students that now work for these big companies after graduation.",

I know there are marketing analyst for companies, so you could put both majors to use in the future after graduation.  Definitely join the BIS Society once you start in Chico State.

    "postText": "I'm looking for people who might be interested in forming a CSU Chico competitive Lol team. I'm not sure if something like this already exists, but if it doesn't, well other schools have it so why not us???? I don't think rank particularly matters as long as the person is down to study the game a bit and get better at it as a team, as well as individually. If there's a ton of interest we could also have a few teams based on rank, and also scrim against each other. I also haven't looked much into what the collegiate competitions are like, but it would be cool to enter actual tournaments at some point. Anyways if you're interested you can leave your summ name in the comments or dm me!",

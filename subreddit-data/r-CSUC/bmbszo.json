The house is a four bedroom where you would be living with 3 other girls. It is on Chestnut street and is super close to campus and downtown ! Someone who is a student is preferred . The lease starts in July. You can message me on here or email me @Kass.Todd99@yahoo.com for more info if you are interested(:. Thanks!",

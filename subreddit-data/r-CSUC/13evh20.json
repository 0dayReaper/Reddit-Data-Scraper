I want to try to avoid checking the portal every 2 seconds like I'm doing now lol\n\nI called admissions yesterday for a different question and they told me they haven't even looked at my file yet.",

I transferred in fall 2021 and I applied in fall 2020 right before the deadline in November 2020 and I didn\u2019t hear from them until about March of 2021. \n\nChico state currently has super low enrollment (it\u2019s about 13k students for the current spring semester) and they\u2019re looking to get more people in. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear back soon enough just take a deep breath and it\u2019ll come when it comes. \n\nI was the same way, Chico was the last school to let me know if I got in or not, I got my acceptance from csu San Marcos like 3 weeks prior to Chico and Chico was my number one school because of cost and the program I applied to, so it was so annoying to wait so I get it.",

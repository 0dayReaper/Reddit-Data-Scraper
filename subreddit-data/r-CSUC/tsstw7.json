My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

More pros: pretty easy to get classes, professors are accessible, easy to walk around town, super pretty campus, and cost of living after you move out of the dorms is relatively affordable. Cons kind of depend on your perspective: some people love the small town, some feel kind kind of stuck in a rural area; you'll get tired of people saying \"party school!\" every time you tell them where you go; the homeless population has increased the past few years, but I'm from the Bay Area so am unfortunately used to it . . . that's about all I can think of. :)",

What\u2019s your schedule and work/school/life balance like? Do you have to do it?  Im pretty much in a position where I will need to work and go to school full time but maybe not if housing is affordable like I\u2019ve been hearing. Will some of you share your thoughts/experiences? \ud83d\ude0a Thank you.",

Granted it\u2019s been\u2026a hot minute since I was in school, but I worked 32-35 hours a week and took four classes a semester. \n\nNow\u2026my degree is in English lit. I purposefully ended up taking a major I knew I\u2019d pretty much coast through. I don\u2019t see it having been as doable if I were like, doing nursing or comp sci, or even a business degree (where a ton of outside the classroom group work is required). I\u2019m a very fast reader so was able to just slam through reading assignments; I took classes from the same professors, ones I knew didn\u2019t require a ton of work; took classes that double-counted (towards my major and the upper division theme they required at the time), etc. \n\nMy schedules ended up being very long days on campus - stacking as many classes as possible into Tuesday/Thursday - or being there four days a week with classes from roughly 8-11:30am, then rushing to work after. It definitely requires an understanding employer, which yes can be difficult to find. I\u2019d worked at my job for over a year before I broached the subject of starting classes. \n\nAs far as affordability, I can\u2019t really speak to that I don\u2019t think. I was making 10-13 bucks an hour while in school, so less than current minimum, was either sharing an apartment or paying like 650 for my own one bedroom place, and got the GI bill to help as well.",

My gpa suffered. A lot of businesses here both corporate and family owned DO NOT care that you are a college student . You may or may not get lucky to find a place that will respect your school schedule. Also academic advisors advise you not to work if you are taking 12+ units. 12 units is the equivalent to about 30 hours of work per week. (This is what was said to me when building my class schedule every semester) Especially if you are a stem major it will be difficult if you have labs which are at random times and long. (My future brother in  law wasn\u2019t able to work while he was at chico because he was a cellular bio major who had classes + labs 5 days a week) Or like myself being a business major doing upper division course load, I have a lot of math based courses along with a large amount of group projects that take time outside the classroom. Try and find an on campus job that works with your schedule. However that\u2019s hard as well as they prefer work study students. Trust me don\u2019t try to work more than 15-20 hours a week. I worked 30+ hours a week in community college and I was fine but as soon as I got to Chico state and tried the same thing it was a bad idea. Higher coursework load , wonky class schedules , and a lot of employers don\u2019t care that you\u2019re a student. \n\nI will also put a note that it will also affect your ability to socialize , your sleep schedule, and ability to have time to yourself to do what you want (which we all need) . Def would recommend if you can get by with budgeting and working part time I\u2019d recommend that. Don\u2019t overload yourself or you run the risk of burnout. \n\nAlso whoever keeps downvoting me, chill. This is personal experience I\u2019m not telling OP what go do",

If I could work 3 days a week as opposed to 4 I would feel much better about my load and life. I don\u2019t have time for anything and in my spare time I sleep as much as a I can. I feel like I\u2019m always rushing. I\u2019m always stressed. And I\u2019m gaining weight. Definitely don\u2019t want to do this once at chico so I will be scaling back after this semester is finished. \n\nIt\u2019s doable forsure but for me I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice my health and sanity after this experience.",

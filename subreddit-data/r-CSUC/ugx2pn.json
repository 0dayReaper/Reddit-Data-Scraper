    "postText": "I\u2019m planning to transfer to Chico this fall from my local community college and was wondering what the best fitting dorm would be for me. \nI\u2019ve looked at all of them online and so far Konkow looks interesting mainly cause of its LGBT themed housing with the Lavender Living program. (I\u2019m gay) \nDoes anyone have any experience with the dorm or the program? I wanna be able to meet and get to know more LGBT people when I live on campus this fall. \n\nAlso sidenote: what\u2019s the latest time you can successfully apply for housing?",

I don\u2019t know much about konkow so I unfortunately don\u2019t think I can give you too much advice. All I know is I didn\u2019t enjoy UV for the most part because it is so much farther from campus. Still walking/biking distance but Konkow would be waaaaay more convenient for walking to class.",

You\u2019d have to park your car in one of the nearby neighborhoods I think. Which some neighborhoods require a permit to park in (I got a parking ticket this semester for making this mistake). I wish I could be more helpful.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nDecided I\u2019m going to transfer to Chico this fall for CS. I\u2019m excited to be on campus and look forward to the experience! I\u2019d like to ask all the Chico veterans if they have any suggestions/general advice going into my first real year of college. I\u2019m a transfer student, but a year older than most people in my grade. I'd like to grow socially and become a little more outgoing.\n\nI was thinking about living in the dorms for at least the first year that I\u2019m attending. What are the dorms like? What\u2019s the food like? What\u2019s the social scene like? I\u2019d like to be part of a dorm that is social and can party it up when it\u2019s appropriate. I don\u2019t want ruckus every night of the week. Which dorms would y\u2019all suggest I look into? If I don't find a roommate on my own, how good is the roommate pairing system? I'm not the most picky person and seem to get along with different types of people.\n\nI'd like to rush a fraternity. What\u2019s rushing like? Is hazing a big problem? Which fraternities seem to be the most grounded but also fun?\n\nAlso if you are a transfer or older student looking for a roommate feel free to reach out!",

            "comment": "From my personal experience as a transfer i find myself only being able to socialize with people who are also a transfer. I would recommend doing some of the workout classes at the wrec that\u2019s how I\u2019ve made a lot of my friends. \n\nWhen it comes to frats definitely listen to what the other guy commented.\n\nAlso to add on to his comment about food. It really does suck out here.  \n\nLive off campus or find a private landlord. I\u2019ve heard that a lot of the apartments here are owned by the same companies and the management is horrible",

            "comment": "Dorms: As a transfer, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be able to live in the freshman dorms, you\u2019d probably get placed at UV, in which case, I\u2019d recommend some of the nicer and cheaper off-campus alternatives like the Social or the Urban, they\u2019re off-campus dorm-like apartments. Or if you just want an apartment, places like the Post and Redwood Cove will pair you in single-bedroom apartments with a four-person shared living space.\n\nFrats: Delta Chi and Phi Delta are currently under investigation for hazing, as well as one sorority. If you want a more small and personal feeling where everyone is going to know you and you know you won\u2019t be hazed or drugged at a party, reach out to the TKE kids, they\u2019re a group of only like 10-ish brothers and they\u2019re located away from the main frat row area, it\u2019s a super chill and laid back environment, much more enjoyable than typical frat parties.\n\nFood: Chico food sucks ass. Learn to cook, you\u2019ll need it. The food from the dinning hall is okay for the first week, then it\u2019s the same stuff over and over again. As for the restaurant scene, it\u2019s mostly just chains with a few over priced and mediocre ma and pa stores sprinkled in.",

            "comment": "I went into dorms this past fall, and let me say that the rules for COVID was extremely strict. If you lived in one dorm hall you couldn\u2019t go to other halls, you couldn\u2019t have more than 2 people per room. You couldn\u2019t be within 6 ft of anyone, even if your wearing a mask. There were appointment times for showering, and if they caught you breaking the rules 3 times, you can be put on suspension, where they can revoke your housing privileges. Honestly, if I could do it again, I would\u2019ve gone into an apartment. While it was nice seeing people and making friends, it was extremely difficult to find, keep, or interact with your friends. And I know that they aren\u2019t doing it on purpose, and it\u2019s all for the safety of the students, but living in the dorms felt like I was trapped there. If you want to talk more about it feel free to DM",

    "postText": "Hi! I was admitted to Chico State for animal science and I was wondering how good the program is. I want to go into the prevet route but from what I've heard this program is geared towards farm animal production and management. Also, I want kind of a low key outdoorsy life style and not much of the partying scene (heard chico parties a lotttt). Do you guys think it would be smarter to go to a cc for 2 years then transfer to a school with a better prevet track?",

If you want a good outdoors scene then Chico is definitely the place, especially if you have a snow-geared car and a small group of friends- and some disposable cash of course. Though I would recommend transferring from a CC, it\u2019s cheaper, freshman housing here sucks, and in all honesty most of the freshman class is unbearably annoying, transfers and exchange students tend to be the best people here to hangout with for some reason- imo",

    "postText": "I\u2019m (28f) going to start school this fall and am looking for other older students to befriend. I haven\u2019t even started school and I\u2019m already anxious about feeling out of place because of my age.  Partying with freshly out of high school people doesn\u2019t sound appealing to me since I\u2019m in a different phase in my life. I\u2019m not huge into the party scene, but do enjoy the occasional drink here and there. I\u2019m looking for other low key people. I love coffee, movies, cooking, and would love to start hiking.",

            "comment": "I'm an online student and don't live anywhere close to Chico so my interactions on campus have been limited. I'm about a decade older than you though, and when I have attended in-person classes I didn't feel out of place. Of the 5-6 students in my last in-person class visit, I'd guess only 1-2 felt \"young\" to me. YMMV though.\n\nI took classes at a community college prior to transferring to Chico and found that experience to be a little different, but not much. There were definitely students in class who were half my age (literally) but they became some of my closest connections in that class. We didn't go out partying, but we found mutual interests and enjoyed them together (playing disc golf and eating ice cream).\n\nChico is a big enough \"small town\" that you'll likely find it easy to connect with non-students in the community, too.",

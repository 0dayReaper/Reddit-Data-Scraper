The first day I moved in (after coming all the way from WA state) my car got broken into from my neighbors, who left beer bottles all over the roof of my car that trailed back to their front door. We called the cops on them so many times because they had huge parties with fighting. Summers suck because the pool is overthrown by random non-residents because you can get inside the pool by reaching over the fence.\n\nTo be honest anything on Nord Ave is trash... Best of luck!",

    "postText": "im transferring to chico from community college in la county to escape living w my family, i was able to drive by the chico campus &amp; some of the neighborhoods around the school &amp; i liked the campus &amp; small town feel but most importantly it\u2019s 6 hours away from my parents. the housing off campus seems limited right now im not sure if it\u2019s since kids were kicked out but im wondering if next semester there will be more options? also is spring 2021 going to be 100% online or will there be some in person classes? ive considered finding roommates but i have a cat that i cant live without so i\u2019d have to find a place &amp; people that allow my cat &amp; does anybody know how the roommate matching works at some off campus housing? im a lesbian woman if someone could tell me what the lgbtq+ life is like at chico? thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi hello there! I grew up in Pasadena so I I know a little bit about what you're thinking about when you're thinking about moving to Chico.\n\nAs far as LGBTQ, there's going to be clubs and other organizations on campus, and the campus community in general is very supportive.\nChico is a little liberal bastion in a fairly conservative part of California, primarily because of the college. In your interactions with college students and faculty I think you're going to have a very positive experience, and generally the town folk are the same. Be aware there is more open conservativism in the area simply because we are in Northern California.\n\nI have a post up looking for roomates on the Chico Student Housing 2020-2020, but depending on what you're looking for in a roommate go ahead and use discretion. I know the pine tree apartments, the place I live at, allows cats fairly easily, and most of The people living at the apartment complex are college students\n\nClasses are going to be 100% online next semester, no telling next fall\n\nIf you have any questions, please DM me!",

Head over the Chico Student Housing Facebook page. Write a housing post and your inbox will be flooded with message. Not sure if classes will be 100% online but looking the class schedule  [https://cmsweb.csuchico.edu/psp/CCHIPRD/EMPLOYEE/SA/s/WEBLIB\\_HCX\\_CM.H\\_CLASS\\_SEARCH.FieldFormula.IScript\\_Main](https://cmsweb.csuchico.edu/psp/CCHIPRD/EMPLOYEE/SA/s/WEBLIB_HCX_CM.H_CLASS_SEARCH.FieldFormula.IScript_Main)  seems like it.",

There seems to be a lot of open apartments, rooms for rent, and lease take overs right now.\n\nFrom what I've heard, spring 2021 is most likely going to be online. But even if you move here, you'll be able to be apart of the community and experience chico, and all of the nature here. Its also a decent time to look for jobs. I had a similar situation when I first moved here (I grew up in LA and wanted far away from socal without paying out of state tuition. Fell free to DM if you need anymore advice.)",

For housing, you definitely want to be off campus to save money, and finding a place that allows cats is pretty easy, if anything you might have to pay a small pet deposit but I always had no problems with kitties. As for the climate of the town, tends to be very conservative, but the campus itself has an awesome LGBTQ community, with groups, clubs, events, professors all in allyship together. I highly recommend checking out GSEC and the MCGS department!  \n\nAlso just a plug but if you are looking to find a new group of awesome women and try something new, the CS women\u2019s rugby team is pretty much all LGBTQ and welcomes all people who identity as women, with zero rugby experience :)",

As other people have mentioned we have GSEC and stuff but the better club is the Pride Club (imo). \n\nIf you have the liberty of choosing where to live I highly recommend living somewhere east of campus. There's a house near my place with a trans flag outside and it is a very nice neighborhood over here. The places around Nord Ave kinda sketch me out.",

Nord is mostly where the students choose to live so there will be plenty of other students there.\n\nIf you asked me I'd just say to hover around esplanade or east of it because I think those areas are really nice, but honestly choose whatever is cheaper.",

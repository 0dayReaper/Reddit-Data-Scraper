The negativity is mainly regarding strict rules, bad management, dirty units, bad food, and a few other things that were recurring elements among reviews I found on Yelp and other review sites. I'm just here to see if anyone has first or even second-hand knowledge/experience with this place.",

As for the crime, most of it is in the downtown area which happens to be where a lot of the student residences and fraternities are. I think that the student presence improves that area by a huge amount. But the criminal/violent element is still there. Keep in mind that, even in a dangerous area, most people are still decent people. It only takes a few bad apples to create a bad reputation. Thank you for your patience and understanding brothers and sisters.",

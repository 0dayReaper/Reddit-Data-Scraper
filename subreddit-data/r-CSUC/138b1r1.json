I'm going there so I can register for classes and stuff. It seems like the easiest way. Plus, I can explore the campus more, and possibly get to know some other students/professors in my major. Hope this helps :)",

It was mandatory too. \n\nIt was eight hours of, \"this is our school, this is what we offer, and this is why drugs and heavy alcohol use is bad.\" It was so painful. We also broke off to smaller groups to play ice-breaker games, but you never saw those people again and then we went to meet the major department head where they talked about their programs.............................\n\nI'm going to do the online one for Chico so I can enroll in classes.",

Gives me a new drive and incentive to do better in my classes this semester! Anything I should know about so I can come in prepared? I am enrolled in the Computer Animation and Game Development BS.",

The biggest difference you\u2019ll see from HS to college is a shift in freedom. When it comes down to it, you\u2019ll get all the education and experience that you want if you put in the work. You\u2019ve gotta structure your schedule and your coursework around your own needs, there\u2019s nobody around to tell you what you need to do; which is scary at first but ultimately one of the best things about university. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019ve got any questions about the courses, campus, culture, or anything really. Nice work man.",

I'm just glad I have all of my general ed done. Now I just gotta focus on getting my first major this semester and then getting my second major during the summer (I'm double majoring). The one thing to ruin my acceptance high is of course my dad asking how am I going to pay for it, him having no interest in helping me whatsoever and thinking I'm just gonna ask him to pay for everything. I was thinking on maxing out my government loans and getting the max financial aid to cruise off of to pay for books and classes but I know that's pretty dangerous to get myself into debt like that. Any advice on that would be a great help. Just wish the BOG extended to CSU's as well.",

Imo the best way to get by in Chico without racking up too much debt is by using CalGrant, CalFresh, and work study if you have the time. Chico has a partnership with CalFresh so you can apply through the college pretty easy. Also, every Friday all the unsold food from the campus stores goes to the on-campus food pantry. You can literally live off of that if you get there early enough lol. Also, idk if you knew this bit, but the earlier you apply for grants through fafsa, the more money you\u2019re likely to get. You\u2019ll still come out of uni with debt, but nothing compared to a UC or private college.",

After they found out I was attending college, they gave me some unfair stipulations such as having to work 20 hours a week if in college, in order to get CalFresh, which by their income calculations, would mean I would get less than $100 a month for foods. If Chico has a program then maybe I can override that stipulation or maybe they were just lying to me, I don't know. \n\nI did already fill out a fafsa for 20-21 for Chico. However, I never applied for a grant before so I'm not sure how much of that works yet. I want to go with my family to Welcome Week on the 4th but I'm not sure if they care enough to give up a Friday night to drive up there, spend the night, then spend the next day touring the place then drive back (5 hour drive). Luckily there is a train that goes from Corcoran to Chico. Like $40 though one way.",

This is because while our lower division classes are common, our upper division classes are split up and those dont work for both. It is ok those because the instructors will help make a plan that fits your plans best. \n\nI am on the game dev side also and have enjoyed it so far, let me know if you have any questions about a particular class!",

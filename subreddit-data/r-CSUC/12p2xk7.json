From an ex-honors program freshman: the honors program is like a liberal arts minor with a GPA requirement and some good perks like guaranteed housing and priority registration. In the short term those alone make it pretty worth it. I did the lower division requirements and then got dropped as an upperclassman (GPA + taking major courses with no honors courses for too many semesters) and turned out just fine. \nUnless you want the wild crazy Whitney Hall dorm experience, the honors dorms + study spaces are a pretty good perk as you settle into college life. \nEnjoy your time at Chico! It will go by quicker than you think!",

I think I counted 80+ fire alarms over the course of my freshman year from Whitney hall alone. By contrast, Sutter Hall (which had the dining hall set off the fire alarm a lot) had to evacuate 40 or so times? But Whitney has the reputation of being the party dorm",

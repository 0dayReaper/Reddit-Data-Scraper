    "postText": "Hi! My daughter is starting Chico in the fall (freshman) and is considering the dorms at Whitney. They are taking about 1,200 students in single dorm rooms. She is a biology major, doing the honors program. She was able to get one in-person class.\n\nI am wondering if there will still be a \"college experience\" in the fall with COVID 19 going on.  Is it worth it for her to dorm and have one in-person class? What would she do all day, sit at a lap top doing zoom classes/Netflix? She could do that at home for free. :) Maybe she will make friends in the honors dorms or great experiences?\n\nAs parents, we feel like she worked really hard in highschool, did sports and had a great HS experience until COVID ended her senior year. She's fine but we thought she could just try to get a modified college experience or at least begin it.  Any thoughts or is that insane with one in-person class? Thanks!!",

It seems like she should be on campus forming relationships with faculty, seeking research opportunities and maybe even getting an on campus job which will help open doors for her after graduation. With fewer students on campus she will probably have more opportunities.",

Studying with people and making friends? Yes, that will happen because there's always people on campus. Some resources might be cut back or unavailable like the WREC (gym) or in person appointments with teachers or the career center.\nMore stereotypically, the college experience of drinking and going to parties will probably still happen like it always does, but maybe on a lesser scale. \n\nA big concern of yours should be that, with the spike in covid cases recently and a possibilty it may make a comeback when the weather gets colder, the university may decide to change their mind and cancel their campus housing altogether.",

Back in April or beginning may they sent out a housing update and they said that they were overwhelmed with request and how 2,000 people applied and they are still sorting through it. That was shortly after the housing application opened and now they have to cut that number in half meaning that Literally half of the applications will actually get a spot. However if you did apply and your just wondering if she should go, I say she does I\u2019m going :) think about it she will have a less stressful year. She can wake up do school from her dorm and still enjoy her social life. Plus everything is opening back up so it\u2019s better she gets a head start on life then go in the spring and people are already in social cliques. Good luck!",

So she will be taking several classes to occupy her time, correct?  Even if not, freshman year still has a lot of free time - and that's a good thing.  As long as she can stay on top of her work, she should explore Chico as its a wonderful community. \n\nIt's difficult for me to imagine exactly how social interactions will take place.  When I went to CSUC, my friends were my fellow dorm inhabitants, but after that first year, my friends quickly became those in my major, as I spent the majority of my time studying with them.  I see how that dynamic will be changed as well.  However, risk is lowered when outdoors, and Chico is revered for its outdoor activities.  To me, the Chico college experience revolves around that. \n\nReading your comment, \"She's fine but we thought she could just try to get a modified college experience or at least begin it\", I guess I don't understand what that means.  What are you envisioning a modified experience to be?  In the end, it seems like however the year will play out is how it will play out.  And it seems most young people will take it seriously but still find a way to satisfy their social desires.",

She is taking 14 units, with only one science lab that will be an in-person taught class while all the rest are online classes, which makes me wonder if she should even go to Chico. We live in Southern California.\n\nI know no one knows for sure what it will be like with all the covid protocols in place, so I think it will be a modified college experience while she will not have a roommate, has one class a week that she actually goes to and will not play a club sport.\n\nI agree the year will play out as it should and I'm sure things will be good either way. Thanks again. :)",

There are facilities like the ecological preserve where she can volunteer or get an internship that will help with her major. A lot of Biology majors are involved with the preserve in some capacity. Most Biology majors I know end up teaching so she might want to check out that pathway and see if there is some coursework she can do. They might have a 4 year credential program. \n\nIt would be cheaper to stay home and attend your local CSU, but I believe there are ways to maximize a Biology Major even if campus is mostly online",

We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen as far as number of classes in-person for the fall or spring but we figured that simply being in town he will still have opportunities to interact with other students and (hopefully) get a job. Son stayed in Shasta hall last year and I think he would have really liked having a room to himself so think incoming students will still have plenty of chances to have a quality first year experience. I\u2019m biased as an alum as well but Chico is a beautiful campus and some genuinely nice faculty/staff to provide support. Definitely cheaper to stay home but I think it\u2019s either go straight out of HS or transfer after AA degree from community college, both are good options but we really wanted our son to get out of Orange County and start his own adventure.

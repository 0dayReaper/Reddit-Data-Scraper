I wanna try and move in sometime mid/early January. I\u2019ve been looking at timber creek apartments because I have a few friends who live in an apartment there already and I heard it\u2019s a pretty social apartment complex.",

You'll have to find someone who's leaving chico in the end of the fall semester or try and find a place that will lease a place to you. I recommend posting on the chico house Facebook group and see if you could take someone's lease over in January.",

Strongly recommend to read Yelp/Google reviews before signing a lease with anyone. Also recommend thoroughly reading through your lease before signing. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "I got into both chico and san diego for the civil engineering major, and I'm asking those at the northern college here what they think. I don't care about climate or parties or anything like that I just care about the quality of the education. Would I be better off in a bigger city like SD because of more internships and job opportunities or is Chico the way to go? I have until June 30 to decide, thank you",

You can get really close with professors, first name basis with some. Class sizes are good too! Hope this helps. Partying is not required, and most people don't care about it anyway.\n\nPM me if you have any questions",

I know several Civil Engineering majors that took advantage of that and got paid summer internships and jobs after graduation. That recruiting is still happening even with C-19.\n\nGo to whatever college will be cheapest and allow you to graduate with the least amount of debt.",

If I got into both and didn\u2019t care about the social environment I\u2019d go to SD, but taking it into account I\u2019d go to Chico. \n\nEven without the parties or anything I prefer Chico people and the city\u2019s amenities. It\u2019s to the point where I get annoyed with people when visiting family back in SD.\n\nSan Diego is more prestigious but Chico also has a good engineering program.",

I know a lot of friends who are studying civil at SDSU and a lot of people studying at Chico too ( I'm currently in the engineering program). Outside of education they both have a pretty good party scene, it's just the difference between big city vs small town",

I visited SDSU and went around San Diego with a friend that went there and Chico\u2019s small, college town vibe just can\u2019t be beat in the CSU system. Except maybe by SLO but Chico is so much more affordable. \n\nA lot of my friends were CM or civil engineering and they had no problem finding jobs and internships all over norcal and the bay area.",

    "postText": "Does anyone know of anyone or have experience living at the Franciscan Apartments on Sacramento Ave? I was about to fill in my application with my roomate, and the property manager from Pomona west apartments called me and talked major shit about the complex, saying it's not safe and that I'll regret living there. When I tried to ask him why he insisted he couldn't go anymore in depth. This has me rethinking everything. Was he just jealous I won't sign his lease and decided to be a condescending unprofessional ass, or is he saving me from a bad first semester at Chico and a year-long lease? Please share your experience. I've been frantically looking for reviews of The Franciscan Apartments online, but all the reviews are from over 10 years ago. Please help!",

Only lived there for a year and had a different property manager by the end of they year.\n\nDidn\u2019t have much issue with noise either and neighbors were friendly.\n\nHope this is kind of helpful.",

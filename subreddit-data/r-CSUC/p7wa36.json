    "postText": "was wondering if anyone had thoughts on the difficulty of the history before/ the history after the civil war classes, ive been told theyre a grad requirement at either cal states or chico specifically. a lot of the reviews at my CC all say it felt like a part time job with how much work it was, so wondering if it was easier at chico or if i should just do it now. for context i am a CS major but will be transferring and plan on being at chico for 3 years, so my work load will be relatively lighter",

If anything, just use rate my professor to choose the section with the lightest work load if you're worried about that. Compared to any CS class, though, it will be close to no effort regardless if taken at cc or a csu as long as the professor isn\u2019t there to make your life miserable. Just do the assignments and you\u2019ll be fine.",

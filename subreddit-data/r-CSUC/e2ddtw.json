Or for the instructions that we were given if you are taking a lower division course with the one time exception to take with your higher division courses? I\u2019m having trouble with this priority registration myself. I got an email telling me to \u201ccheck my student center to see the specific time I have access to online registration\u201d but it doesn\u2019t specify where I can find these details exactly.",

If your registration window is open, it will allow you to register, otherwise it will tell you your registration window.  I recall it was pretty intuitive.\n\nedit:  Go to the Portal &gt; Student Center.  On the right side of the Student Center (with the Oracle logo in the top left), there is a section \"Enrollment Dates\" and a link to \"Open Enrollment Dates\".  That's your registration window.",

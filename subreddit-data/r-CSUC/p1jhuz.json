Creekside is decent if you're a sophomore but after that definitely don't want to live at places like Village at The Timbers, Pine Tree, Timber Creek, Pomona, a lot of those massive ones on Nord. They're usually all far and lacking any real student life. The best is just the no name ones downtown. Or maybe Loveboat (Garden Terrace). I lived at the apartments on 4th and I for like 2 years and it was so convenient.  \n\n[These ones. I'd highly recommend](https://www.apartments.com/630-w-4th-st-chico-ca-unit-01/z6n0f2y/)",

It's almost exclusively sophomores and mostly Greek life. So more than anything If you're a bit older it's just kind of awkward. Timber Creek apartments (The Zoo) are pretty similar, But I'd say can skew a little older. A lot of fifth years stay at the Chestnut Arms and still pretty sociable. What type of place are you looking for.\n\n Also I'm not sure why it's called Love Boat some of these names were given in like the '80s. Nicknames that just took. I think it's because there's one pool in the middle and all the apartments kind of circle around it. I live that 4th and ivy they called it little TJ's. No one knows why either because of Tijuana where I heard there used to be a guy there that was called TJ or his brother was TJ.",

The general rule of thumb is don't go past the train tracks or past the two one ways that take you to HWY 99, So Basically the Chico Streets (**Chestnut, Hazel, Ivy**, Cherry Orange) preferably those first three. However 7th St Manor or Bidwell Oaks isn't too far.\n\n[Ideally this area\n](https://i.imgur.com/kDEoESa.png), train tracks start after orange and those two long orange streets are the highway one way entrance\n\nIf I had to rank those, with top 3 being a tier above the bottom 2. \n\n1. Loveboat/Garden Terrace - Loudest but most social, still manageable\n2. Chestnut Arms - Good balance of social and quiet, little out of the way from the loudest street Ivy\n4. 4th and I - Good balance social but small so won't get too loud and best location (across from Riley's)\n5. 7th St Manor - Kinda far but fine\n6. Bidwell Oaks - Kinda far but fine\n\nI was kinda a big partier so I loved being on 4th and Ivy however I was also Computer Science and my roomate was Mechanical Engineering so definitely not so crazy you can't study. But if you are a little on the quieter side can't go wrong with the Arms. But if you want to for sure have the opportunity to meet people and don't mind being on the rowdier side that's definitely going to be Loveboat, closest you'll get to something like Creekside but for upperclassmen.\n\n*Edit also yes I know wayy too much about Chico but hey what can I say best 5 years of my life \ud83d\ude02",

They were actually pretty cool about it and let me keep him at the property without any extra fees or deposit until I got him homed a few months later. They also let me sign a six month lease extension and I got most of my deposit back. Compared to my awful experience with Chico Sierra, Campos was solid.",

    "postText": "Hi, so I stupidly thought I had two holds on my account for not adding a class yet, when it was around late November. Then a few more holds appeared on my account when it was all said and done I had to do the alcohol and the sexual assault video/test to get the holds off my account but I found out the first two holds were actually holds because I needed proof of my vaccinations. I had to wait to get a doctor appointment which took a month. I finally have the lab results  back about my vaccinations but I see now that when trying to add any classes that I need or want they are all too full. \nI could show up and try to add and hope and pray that I can add but There are a couple classes I can\u2019t add in. I\u2019m on financial aid to help me pay for classes. I do not want to waste any of the money that goes to my tuition for a semester where I\u2019m taking classes I don\u2019t need to graduate or classes that don\u2019t go to my degree. \nIs there any way to take a semester off from spring and continue in the fall? With out having to re apply to the CSU and pay another 200$ enrollment fee?",

I did it for this semester for different reasons and they don't seem to probe that much into your reasoning. The form is also right in front of the Office of the Registrar when you walk into the Student Services building.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a transfer student and a computer science major. I\u2019m currently in my third semester at Chico State. Overall I\u2019m quite happy with my decision to study CS at CSUC. All of the classes that I have taken have been fun and engaging. \n\nOne of the main benefits of Chico State are the classes sizes. Most of my classes have been 25-40 people. I\u2019ve had most of the CS professors at this point and they all have been very helpful,clearly want you to succeed, and there because they have a passion for teaching. Again one of the benefits of smaller classes is that during a professor\u2019s office hours you\u2019ll most likely be able to get one-on-one help if you are struggling with an assignment. \n\nMost of the classes are a mix of theory and hands on practice. All the classes have been pretty rigorous but that\u2019s expected because I don\u2019t know if an \u201ceasy\u201d computer science class exists.\n\nThis was my 2 cents. I hope it helps!",

So hopefully those comeback next semester.\n\nIn terms of the claim that Chico is a party town. My answer is that every college town is a party town and if that\u2019s the reason someone gave as to why they didn\u2019t succeed then that\u2019s is just an excuse and there was probably more going on. \n\nQuick side note, I wouldn\u2019t recommend living in the dorms unless you are actively looking to party. I would just live in off campus, it\u2019s way cheaper anyway.\n\nThen for your last question. The CS department is completely diverse with people coming from all walks of life. If you were hoping to find people with similar backgrounds as you I\u2019m sure you will find them.",

The professors remember who you are and generally go above and beyond to help see their students succeed.\n\nI think my favorite part about it is that IMO Chico\u2019s CS program has more of an emphasis on lower-level design, so you\u2019ll learn how integrated-circuits work, you\u2019ll learn how a breadboard works, you\u2019ll learn how to configure physical network switches and routers (we have a million dollar networking lab which was a blast to use), maybe the basics of how a microcontroller works. And our primary coding language is C++ while many other colleges use Java or even python. I think it gives you a more natural grasp of how a computer \u2018thinks.\u2019 So I like that there\u2019s a bit more to it then just being a glorified software engineer (but there\u2019s definitely a lot of that too).\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rigorous, but show me a CS program that isn\u2019t. My take is that you don\u2019t need intelligence to pass any of these classes or be particularly good at computing, you just have to put in the work and you\u2019ll make it.\n\nI think classes are more hands on then theory, but it depends on the class. Intro to databases and especially AI for instance were very theory heavy, but in most classes you\u2019re gonna be building something functional.\n\nWas it worth it? For me, yes. I almost went to SJ state and I\u2019ve heard from other CS students there that it\u2019s a nightmare to get into classes, and once you do get into classes they\u2019re not very good. Here you have relatively small class sizes, expenses are very light (for living in California), and I think I\u2019m getting a quality education here.\n\nInternships are on and off, I got extraordinary lucky with them, but I know a few people that have been having harder times. We have pretty decent connections I think, especially with a few select large companies, but not to the level of cal poly or SJ State.\n\nI would reach out to one of the professors here, they\u2019re usually pretty happy to discuss the program with you. I\u2019d recommend Todd Gibson or the department head, Tyson Henry, because those are who I talked to when I first toured the campus and they\u2019re very welcoming and informative.\n\nBy the way we have a very active student-run Chico CS discord here. The people there are very friendly and they would probably be happy to answer any specific questions you have about the program. Feel free OP or anyone else to message me for a link (you don\u2019t have to be a CS student to join)",

It took a whole lot of work at times as I'm not the strongest programmer, but was super interesting, engaging, and overall very well taught. \n\nMy absolute favorite classes were any by Tyson Henry, and by far my least favorite was assembly, by Judy Challinger. She took what could've been a really interesting and enlightening subject and made it miserable.\n\nTyson, though, made the whole discipline worth it to me. His enthusiasm and willingness to work really hard with you over long hours or late into the night to understand something really dragged me over the hump and got me completely hooked.\n\nNear the end of the degree, I applied at build.com for a developer job as practice, and woops, got offered the job.",

When I visited Chico, I found the lack of diversity to be disturbing. Growing up in a very diverse place made me very uncomfortable to be in a place where there\u2019s a huge majority of a single race.\n\nHonestly, if the diversity was better there, I would be going to Chico a year from now. Nonetheless, I\u2019m sure the education here is still great as other people stated in this discussion",

So there might be more diversity when school is in session. my only target school is UOP (University of The Pacific). It\u2019s a private school in Stockton, California. I have a great transfer plan that allows me to get my lower division major requirements and GE done. When I transfer, I\u2019ll have exactly 70 units done and it\u2019ll take me only two years at UOP to get my degree",

I do not think I could afford private school, but I will certainly be going to CSU Chico if I cannot get into UC Davis. Quite frankly, I just want to be done with school and do not care about the demographics as long as I can get things done.",

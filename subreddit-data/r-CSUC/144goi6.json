I used to be an OSCM major then a project management major then I landed on marketing only because it\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t plan on pursuing marketing as a career. An advisor once told me regardless of the concentration and regardless if you choose to pursue a career in your concentrations field, it\u2019s still a business degree you are hire able everywhere",

With HR it\u2019s a bit tricky you can be in HR or recruiting without an HR concentrated degree. Marketing you can do anything, general management concentration well it\u2019s in the name you can do management or anything related to management. OSCM you can do supply chain or logistics etc. what also matters is job experience. I got my AS before coming to Chico state and I worked full time as an admin assistant and junior buyer , I also got an internship with Sierra Nevada as a technical writer (never done it before but they hired me bc I was familiar with manufacturing) so just remember no matter what concentration you get it\u2019s still a business degree just make sure to have relevant job experience and internships. Try a bit of everything. I certainly didn\u2019t know what I wanted when I first started. In CC I was literally a nursing major and then a psych major and then I finally landed in business and then after I came to Chico state I changed a few times back to psych then nutrition management and then back to business and changed my concentration multiple times before finally taking certain upper division core classes to find what I really liked learning about",

You could become a marketing advisor but I would highly suggest trying to find on-campus jobs or internships that allow you to practice marketing principles. Because my sister-in-law graduated from chico State last year and she\u2019s a marketing advisor for a real estate company . She graduated with a small business management degree but she worked as a student marketing assistant on campus for 2 years and had a portfolio with experience . You could work for any company and really you could do PR or advising/consulting, market analysis , market research, there\u2019s a lot , There\u2019s so many things you could do you could also learn to do UX design or data analysis on the side like get Coursera certificates like I\u2019m currently pursuing a UX design certificate.I don\u2019t know what big companies hire because I\u2019m going back in to office/administrative/ PM roles  but I would assume the corporate companies like Google or real estate companies or social media companies/ tech companies would be a good bet, you could also join a marketing firm. But make sure to gain experience while in school.",

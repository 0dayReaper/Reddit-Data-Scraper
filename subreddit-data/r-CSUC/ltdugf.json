    "postText": "Hello. I'm a high school senior, and I'm thinking of going to Chico as a Freshman. But I have a concern. I've taken 3 cc courses(History, Math, English) in my high school's early college program. Would Chico accept these classes as transferable units if I go there as a freshman? I heard that some colleges make you redo a class even if you've done it at a cc.\n\nMajor: CS\n\nCC Courses GE Satisfaction:\n\nEnglish: A2 English Communication\n\nMath: A4 Mathical Concepts\n\nHistory: D Humanities",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am considering transferring to Chico in the fall. I was wondering if anyone lived in the dorms as a transfer student and how their experience was? I am turning 21 this summer and don't know if there will be a huge age gap. I am a little nervous meeting people too and was thinking that the dorms would probably be easier to meet people that way.",

I knew people that liked UV though, just really depends on who you live with. You can have the option to switch roommates if someone else wants to switch too.",

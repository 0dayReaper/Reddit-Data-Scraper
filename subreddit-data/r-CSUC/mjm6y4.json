When I take a Religious Studies class, no precautions are taken because \"a god is not dangerous.\" As King, the oldest world religion, I will empirically refute that notion. e.g. This is former local reporter Christina Vitale.",

Human eyeballs are used by humans to look at women, but what the mortal eyeball sees and what a woman actually is varies a huge amount.  Humans do not actually see reality well at all.  And what they see well they can only see in very small portions at a time.  For example, you can go to class or you can stay home and watch TV.  Your eyeball cannot see both the class and the TV at the same time unless you stream a lecture or take a TV into class - and then it is difficult to see both things at the same time.\n\nA mortal may have differing opinions on any particular issue, but opinions are limited to mortals while reality remains \"all mortals must eat food.\"  The creator of humans is obviously superior to human opinion because it precedes human opinion.  All \"indigenous\" cultures are theocracies - Ancient Rome, China, Japan, Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Native American cultures, etc. - you are accountable to the law \"King\" with as little leniency as you are accountable to the law \"murder.\"  This is why virtually all indigenous cultures are single-party autocracies.",

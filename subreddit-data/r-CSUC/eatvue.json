    "postText": "Just in case...\n\nI apparently have misplaced or lost a brand new sweater that I've had less than two weeks. I'm really sad about it. I've check with lost and found on campus as well as the Dean's office and the anthropology office in Butte. \n\nI may have left it in one of the computer labs on the second floor. Has anyone seen it? There's a link below to see what it looks like. I got it in orange. \n\nPlease let me know if you've seen it! I'm super bummed because it took a lot to feel OK spending that much money on myself, I usually shop at thrift stores. I can't believe it's gone...\n\nAnyway thank you\n\nhttps://wearpact.com/women/apparel/sweaters/sweater%20cardigan/wa1-wsc-whh",

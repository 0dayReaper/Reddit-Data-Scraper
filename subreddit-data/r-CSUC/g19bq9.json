Hours of sitting in the sun listening to speeches and waiting your turn, then 10 mins of being shuffled backstage, walking out, getting placeholder diploma, shaking hands, taking picture, then walking back to your seat to sit in the sun for a few more hours. Then it's over.",

But the decision about commencement was made (with input from a lot of students, too, by the way) that safety was the primary issue.\n\nMaybe you should throw a graduation party, when groups are allowed to meet again--even wear a cap and gown, so you can take pictures--and invite all your family and friends .  Honestly, that could be as meaningful (and a lot more fun) than sitting around for 3 hours in the hot sun listening to dumb speeches and hearing the names of over 1000 students be mispronounced, waiting for your 10 seconds to walk on the stage...\n\nFinally, you need to learn to find appreciation for your accomplishments from within, and not rely on the approval of others.  You will be much more fulfilled in life that way.\n\nIf it is worth anything, I am proud that you made the huge effort and commitment to go to college, especially as a first gen student.  I hope you will look back and feel it was worth it.  (What did you major in, by the way?  Have you found a job yet?)  Good luck as you go out there and face the world!",

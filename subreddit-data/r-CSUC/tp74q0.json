    "postText": "Hello, I posted here recently before I visited Chico. I was really excited before and I had even planned to commit there; however, it doesn\u2019t seem as exciting or entertaining as I expected outside of the dorms. Maybe my visit was a bad representation of student life there, but it made me reconsider to be completely honest. I also got admitted into Sacramento state. I don\u2019t know as about Sac State as I do about Chico, but even the little I know made it seem more fun. I just feel like there is not a whole lot to do except hike, swim, workout, study, or join a frat/sorority. I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t regret picking Chico. The students seem really proud of their school (which I love), people actually on campus seem pretty nice, and the campus is absolutely gorgeous (don\u2019t even get me started with how incredible the gym is). Although, my trip actually made the college seem less appealing to me because the town doesn\u2019t seem as excited as I expected.\n\nIn short, here are some questions I have for current students/alumni:\n\n- What do students typically do during the day besides their classwork? \n\n- Are frats/sorority members the only people who go to parties (besides rare occasions)?\n\n- How do students meet new people outside of dorms and parties?\n\n- Are the sporting events a big deal at Chico? (No one really talked about it besides the basketball team)\n\n- (for students who brought their cars their first year) would you recommend I bring my car?\n\n- Is there much crime in the town? (Students seem nice, but outside of campus not as much)\n\n- Outside of the college, the town doesn\u2019t seem very diverse. Is racism an issue, and (this may come off as a controversial question) for better or worse, did you feel like you were treated any differently due to your race?\n\nAnd of course my most important questions:\n\n- What made you choose Chico over any other college? And why are you still happy you went there?\n\n\nI apologize for the long post, but I figured it would be better than making a bunch separate posts. If no one responds to this then I shall do that instead.",

There was a focus on preservation and the development of exhibits. I would look at the Valene Smith museum information (if I remember the name correctly). Dr. Fox (now retired) had a historic archaeology field school as well, I would reach out to the department to see if they still offer it. Otherwise I would check out Sonoma State,  the ASC there has some great folks and they do some historic archaeology. If your junior ends up going to grad school they could do an undergrad degree at one and their graduate degree at the other. Sac State is another good option for undergrad but their graduate program is notorious for taking 6-10 years while other schools like Sonoma State and Chico get grad students out in 3-4 years (or even faster). Feel free to message me with more details if you would like, I'm a working professional in anthropology.",

The real difference is Sac state is in a city, Chico is fairly rural. The city of Chico runs on Chico state. If you go to Sac state, you will pretty much need your car, at Chico you really won't.\n\nNow, on to your questions....\n\n&gt; What do students typically do during the day besides their classwork?\n\nTypical college kid stuff. Join a club, hang out with friends, go out to eat, explore the town, lots of beer pong.\n\n&gt; Are frats/sorority members the only people who go to parties (besides rare occasions)?\n\nThat's a hard no.\n\n&gt; How do students meet new people outside of dorms and parties?\n\nStudent clubs, meal times, roommates, classmates, neighbors, etc.\n\n&gt; Are the sporting events a big deal at Chico? (No one really talked about it besides the basketball team)\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; (for students who brought their cars their first year) would you recommend I bring my car?\n\nIf you are living in the dorm? You don't really need it. I brought mine and I would use it once or twice a week, usually to go to the Tea bar or a shopping center on the far side of town I liked.\n\n&gt; Is there much crime in the town? (Students seem nice, but outside of campus not as much)\n\nNot really? I was a transfer student and the two years I spent at Chico I went to the northern side of town (where the families and people who actually live/work in Chico live) once, and it seemed nice enough. There is probably more crime where the students live.\n\n&gt; Outside of the college, the town doesn\u2019t seem very diverse. Is racism an issue, and (this may come off as a controversial question) for better or worse, did you feel like you were treated any differently due to your race?\n\nHard for me to answer the question. I'm a white male, so no, I didn't really experience any racism. Our student body president was African-American, so among the students it's not really an issue. If you go outside of town, you're probably going to find some Trump-lovin' country folk.\n\n&gt; What made you choose Chico over any other college? And why are you still happy you went there?\n\nI grew up and up until that point, spent my entire life in a large city. I wanted a small, college town. Chico was perfect. I loved my time at Chico. I partied, but not non-stop. I graduated on time with a 3.0 and had fun while doing it. You can go overboard (if you want), some of my friends would go out partying pretty much every single night. I didn't. I restricted myself really to weekends and the occasional weeknight.",

Employers prefer BS students over MS mostly.The program is good you will get decent knowledge in subjects.The faculty is good and knowledgeable.However existing students are finding it very difficult to get jobs.",

This is mainly due to the fact that for the past few months, companies have been laying off thousands of people. These people all have experience as engineers in companies, and recruiters have the upper hand to hire them for the price of a junior engineer (since there is so much supply). As a result, no recruiters want to hire entry level software engineers who just graduated from college with no experience.\n\nThis will most likely change in the next year or two, but right now is just a really shitty time to get in this industry.",

I'm tempted to take both of them since I won't have a job and I can focus solely on those classes. But I also value my sanity, so will two winter classes make me hate life?",

Not to mention you need special permission to sign up for two winter classes (not the case with summer classes) you need above a 3.0 for the last 2 semesters and some other requirements I believe. I\u2019d reach out to the Center for Regional and Continuing Learning they\u2019re the ones who have those forms IIRC. They usually strongly recommend against taking 2 winter classes concurrently.",

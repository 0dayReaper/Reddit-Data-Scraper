    "postText": "I just have a week or so to figure out if I want to officially apply and enroll here. Last year, I got in and so, its just about perfectly fixing upon enrolling here!! I'm an international student whose been fully betting on Mechatronics engineering choice for a full year now. I seem to have very less options to pursue it. What do you think of this program here and the duration taken to complete it, which is just not 4 years at all? Already a year over and gotta opt out of a college enrolled in, temporary enough. Fully rushing. Otherwise, shall I go for some Electrical and computer engineering if its any close to BS Mechatronics engineering? It feels like no way to talk to somebody studying or graduated from BS Mechatronics engineering at CSUC. I've asked enough but no response. So I'm up for reddit here as the last resort.",

It is very doable to complete the program in 4 years but as someone else said, the average length is 5 years.",

Also, can I take that maximum of 6 credits for every summer to help accelerate the pace of studying the program? How is mechatronics there? Do you prefer electrical and computer engineering instead? I may take that up in University of arizona online btw. I'm clearly craving to happily study a program thats good wherever it is and fix on stuff by now.",

One of the major things that all of the engineering programs tend to emphasize is practical learning rather than theoretical learning. For example you will have to take a machine shop course where you have to read technical drawings and go through the process of milling, turning, and drilling material to match the drawing (this class is a highlight for most people in the program).\n\nFor summer courses you probably mostly find the GE classes being offered, so accelerating the program is not very likely unless you can find some of the early math or physics courses. \n\nMy backup plan was to go for electrical if I couldn't do mechatronics (mecha shares more classes with electrical than computer.)",

With an average starting salary of around 70k , they also state that within 5 years you will have a 6 figure salary. The BSIS program is also SAP certified! It\u2019s not as math or science intensive in my opinion compared to other degrees like engineering or biology. However there is a lot of math involved since you need to take accounting, economics and finances courses, and if you go in to operations and supply chain management a majority of upper division work uses math in almost everything for things like planning, forecasting, inventory, etc. Lower division coursework is the exact same as business administration except bsis adds in Mins 235 with is a database design class focusing on SQL. The upper division is almost the exact same as well except BSIS has a few courses switched out for more technical courses. I don\u2019t think there is any overlap with engineering. But the BSIS degree technically qualifies as a STEM degree because it\u2019s a bachelors of science degree. Here are some of the following courses I\u2019ve taken ;\nMarketing , management, finance , business law, macro and micro economics, financial and managerial accounting, statistics, finite math for business, corporate technology integration, operations and supply chain management, Purchasing, &amp; Project management. \n\nYou can pick from three degree options within the BSIS degree: \n- Operations and supply chain management (my degree)  focuses on ERP and logistics, most graduates go in to logistics, production management, procurement,  etc.\n- Management information systems (learning software development , web development, programming, cybersecurity etc. \n- Business Analytics (algorithms, cloud computing, SQL) \n\nI\u2019d say the BSIS degree is well worth it, it teachers lots of very useful skills and compared to my engineering friends I have a lot more time to join clubs, do extra curricular activities, work, and enjoy my time and not be overwhelmed. Hell also probably have a higher GPA being a BSIS major than he would being an engineering major. And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s because the coursework is easy. It\u2019s has its hard classes and it has its easy classes, what I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s manageable and a well worth it degree that can take him in to any career as BSIS is a very sought out degree , especially supply chain management and management information systems. \n\nI truly do enjoy the degree and the college of business is very good with helping people get internships, resume building, career fairs, it\u2019s great! \n\nI enjoy that this degree is actually preparing me for a career I want to pursue (procurement &amp; sourcing management ) well worth it! \n\nI also know people who have BSIS and BADM degrees from Chico state who become engineers at their place of work after a few years! \n\nI hope this helps!",

I say go for it, you\u2019re going to be hard pressed to find someone who graduates from any engineering degree in 4 years. Usually it\u2019s 4 1/2 to 5. If you take summer classes you can absolutely do it in 4, but you can only really take your GE classes over summer. Once you get to like 200 level engineering courses, they don\u2019t offer them online, mainly because you need to take the lab section.",

Any textbooks or resources you can share regarding the college coursework you've done? Maybe, I'd put up e-mail in message if you're fine with basically dumping the actual subject of this program? Interestingly, I'd be the only one who knows myself in the whole of California if I'd be there. It's difficult with a physical health constraint btw",

It wasn't until my 4th year that I actually started getting into MECA specific classes, like controls systems. I highly recommend the program, especially since the workforce is in need of more Mechatronics students than there are. In terms of what classes you take, its essentially a ton of math (up to differential equations), a decent amount of electrical classes like Linear Circuits and Non-linear circuits, and most of the important Mechanical classes like statics, dynamics, strengths, and CAD. You take a few programming classes mainly to learn C/C++ and then some embedded systems classes (which were my favorite) where you program microcontrollers and then build the circuitry that interacts with them. Besides that you take one manufacturing class and then a couple GEs. As far as the quality of the education, its just as good as any other. If your interested in what you actually learn in these classes, just look it up because almost all engineers are essentially taking the same classes. Chico state has an accredited engineering program so you're going to be essentially learning the same things as other accredited schools",

Long story short, there aren't a lot of places to take that up here in my homeland and even if so, all I'm getting is terrible infections as a free gift and clear-cut ineptness in what will be honestly offered already. A great number of people are feeling Mechatronics is not really what it was vouched to be and so, are shifting elsewhere in the critical time periods. Not even close to Mechatronics and BOOM. I'd need to rapidly wrap up my (possibly temporary) journey here and fix elsewhere, which is becoming a lonesome journey tbh because I'm the only taking it up good enough. After a year of betting on this program no matter what, the matter feels diluted and reasonably so. Anyway, I'd hope for the legit best and thank you for your largely clear response.",

Looking back, it definitely would have been highly demanding but possible if you are a regimented and ambitious person. 5 years is acceptable. Try not to go longer than that.  In my 6th year I really felt like it was time for me to get on with my life.",

Maybe you're the type of person who can handle such a high workload, but in my experience most people can't actually learn that much material with only 24 hours a day. I'm most of the way done with mechanical engineering, and I usually stick to 12-15 units per semester.",

It's hard work and requires a tremendous amount of study/homework time. There are lab classes which take up considerably more effort than is reflected in their 0 or 1 units, as well as the fact that nearly every class you take will have at least 2 major projects during the course of a semester. Time management is essential.",

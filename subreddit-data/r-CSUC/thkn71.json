I knew people who were written up for noise complaints, alcohol, etc like 10 times before anything serious actually happened. Also there were several occasions where people were caught smoking in the dorms and nothing ever really happened",

Other universities do charge fines to students.\n\nA single violation does not **usually** mean you get kicked out, though I remember a guy on my move in day show up with a big jar of 2 ounces of weed and was sent home on day 1. He didn't even unpack his stuff. His parents were still there and they sent him away. \n\nI have seen people be assigned homework when it's a health or safety concern. Like 500 words on \"why pulling the fire alarm as a prank is wrong\" or \"why smoking is bad for you\" or something like that.  They do have the ability to freeze your class registration if you don't do the homework. So you wouldn't be able to sign up for classes until you complete it.",

Also would be very helpful to get familiar with Linux (setting up a virtual machine or dual boot, or going bare-metal) -- assuming you aren't already.\n\nSo far I've only seen JavaScript used lightly in the Web Development class, and possibly in Software Engineering, depending on what project you take on.",

            "comment": "Started as CS major, graduating as CINS this semester.  Most of the core curriculum is taught in C++ with Python taking up second place.  Depending on the classes you take, you may see other languages like C, JS, or DBMS languages like MySql or Oracle.  Familiarize yourself with the Linux command line, as most professors will use it with assignment programs or tools.  While not required, it's highly recommended to use a form of version control like Git, especially in later classes.\n\nHaving any knowledge of programming is already a boon, as you will simply be learning how to portray concepts like looping or recursion in the new language than learning the concept from nothing.  I came into Chico State with only JS as my previous teachings, and while it was a little hard to step straight into 311, it was entirely doable.  If you are struggling, ask professors for help.  There's only one professor (whom I will not name) that I've had a negative experience with.",

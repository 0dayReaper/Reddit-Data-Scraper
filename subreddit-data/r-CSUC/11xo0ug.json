    "postText": "Hey Guys! I got into all the UCs I applied to but the small town aspect of chico really attracts me because it reminds me of home. I was curious if CS is impacted? Or the mech engineering major. I got in for Game Dev and Animation. Do you guys have a gaming club etc? I was curious how much there is to do there. I don't drink or party. I'm more of an introvert. Do you guys have available housing ? Please let me know anything about the school! Ty\ud83e\udef6\n\nEdit: How is the semester system compared to the quarter system?",

            "comment": "I went to Chico and while I loved the experience, if you got into a top tier UC (like other than Riverside or Merced), I would highly recommend going that route. Also, are you planning to live in the Bay Area after graduation? I\u2019m from So Cal and the bulk of my network that I met through Chico live in the Bay Area for the most part, so it wasn\u2019t much help with finding new jobs in So Cal.\n\nI loved Chico and would not change my experience; however, if I had the grades to get into a top tier UC at the time, I would have stayed out of the CSU system entirely. Recruiters and hiring managers really do care where you got your degree from (no matter what anyone says) so think about that since your first job or two out of school will also want to know about your academic background. The longer you work, the less and less it matters, but no one can take away your degree. I do feel that the cache or stigma of a degree from UCB or UCLA vs Chico (depending on who is evaluating it) will follow you throughout your career.",

In my experience talking with peers at UC schools, we got a more hands on experience and direct access to our professors in the mechanical/Mechatronics department. Additionally, everyone I know from my class got jobs right out of college, lots of us at big name highly regarded companies. I\u2019ve also heard anecdotally (many times) from recruiters or people who have talked to recruiters that they really like Chico grads, we\u2019re more personable, very open to learning, and have as good of fundamentals and internship experience as anyone.",

CSU\u2019s are typically more practical/hands on versus UC\u2019s being more theoretical in nature. Chico is a great school and I wouldn\u2019t change my decision to go there.

Fellow MECA grad now at big name company and I totally agree. \n\nAlso to add something else of value to OP\u2019s thread, the semester system is definitely slower paced than quarters but from talking to my friends who were on quarters I think I prefer it. It gives a little bit more breathing room with regards to long projects and recovering from a rocky start to the class. If you start off on the wrong foot, you can still work with your professor to make sure you get/do what you need to succeed",

            "comment": "The learning styles at UCs vs CSUs are totally different. You should consider what learning style works best for you and factor that into your decision. Many UC classes are large lectures, followed by a discussion with a teaching assistant. You don't really build a personal relationship with your professors until the really high level classes. \nCSUs have a much better professor to student ratio, and most classes only have 20-40 people in them. The professors at CSUs tend to focus more on teaching where the ones at UCs are more research oriented. You need to be very self sufficient and learn a lot on your own at UCs. \n\nThat being said, Chico is a great school and a cool town. Even if you don't party, there is plenty to do there with plenty of like-minded people to do it with. If you like the outdoors, there is so much to see and do. If you don't like the outdoors, there are a ton of clubs and organizations for different hobbies/interests. \n\nWith the exception of UC Berkeley (and maybe LA), the rest of the UCs don't really have a \"prestigious\" name, and it won't make a difference on your resume if you went to Chico or a UC. Additionally, not sure if this is a consideration for you or not but CSUs are much cheaper. \n\nIn my opinion, go to school that caters to your learning style and where you think you'll have the most fun, the education will be good no matter what you choose.",

Chico rent is cheap- think $400-700 for your own room with several roommates. Santa Cruz expensive, at least double Chico prices, usually sharing a room. Transportation home from Chico can be difficult if you don\u2019t have a car. The school just started a shuttle bus to Sacramento airport, but I don\u2019t know how easy it is to reserve a spot. The train goes through Chico, but leaves/arrives in the middle of the night. Some take the bus to Sac and then the train.",

If you\u2019re not a party person and are introverted there\u2019s not much to do and It can get pretty lonely especially if you don\u2019t go out to meet people. There\u2019s not much to do except eat downtown or go to the movies or go to the dead mall on the other side of town. You can try and join clubs on campus to meet people that won\u2019t be a problem then. But I will say I\u2019ve struggled making friends but I think that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t come in as a freshman so all the people I meet in my now senior level classes aren\u2019t interested in making friends since we\u2019re about to graduate and they probably have an already established friend group. Outside of that it\u2019s a good school",

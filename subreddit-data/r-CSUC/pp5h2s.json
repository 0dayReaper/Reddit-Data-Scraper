    "postText": "Im a senior, dont wanna play all the dumb games with hazing and superiority complexes and what not. I would be looking for a frat that would actually participates in school events, networks, and still make some good friends. A frat that is professional but can still have lots of fun and by professional i dont just mean putting a suit on and calling it a day, a frat that actually stands for something. Honestly dont even know of its worth it since i only have 2 semesters left but still curious to know some options.",

You can ask for as much advice from other people but the only one who can make the choice of whether or not rushing is worth it is you. There\u2019s 14 fraternities at chico state, and if you\u2019re committed one of them will fit your interests.  Rush is in 2 weeks, just come out and meet some guys!",

            "comment": "Sounds like a professional business fraternity is more of what you're looking for, you can actually gain some valuable skills and connections to get a job after graduation as opposed to getting hazed and shit faced with underclassmen in your pledge class (unless your into that). The business fraternities aren't just all work and no play, they know how to have a good time too.",

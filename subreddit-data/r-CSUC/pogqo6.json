Here\u2019s how he roughly explained it:\n\nIf a student doesn\u2019t wear a mask, offer one of the disposable ones. If after offering, they still don\u2019t wear a mask, it can eventually escalate to everyone having to leave the class room, campus police are called, and student could be arrested.\n\nAlthough i haven\u2019t seen anyone not wear a mask in any of my classes\u2026",

If you live in on campus housing, you would have a meeting with the conduct person and could be removed from housing entirely after a couple of times. \n\nIf it's in a classroom then what u/looter809 posted is correct, that's the process that was provided to faculty. I've only had one student not wear a mask in class, and it was a legitimate \"oops!\" and I handed him the box and he put it on. \n\nI've never had an angry student say masks are useless and refuse to wear one. but I also have all hybrid classes, so it's pretty easy to just tell a student who hates masks to join us from Zoom.",

I wish there was more of a culture of wearing your mask if you were on campus, not just in the classroom because you're required to. Even in the classroom, there are people wearing them below their noses, you'd think people would have figured out how to wear it correctly by now. It's maddening seeing more than half of students not wearing masks walking around on campus. There was a business organization giving out free coffee on campus and none of them were wearing masks and the one girl who was pulled it down the whole time to talk. I just don't get it.",

The school should have a window open on one side of the room and the classroom door open on the opposite side. Sitting in a stuffy room with no ventilation wearing masks isn't gong to help. When you see people outside not wearing a mask don't worry about it because they are likely not transmitting anything but smiles and friendly hellos.",

I do not know about you guys but during the first wave of covid, I did not know anyone who had covid. Now I know multiple people who got it or are currently infected. So if you advocating for going maskless, I believe you would worsen the issue to the point where Chico State would shut down if we take off the mask and just \"open the door.\"",

Im just wondering if its worth it to look around for a career that would save me having to go to grad school for decent pay\n\nEventually i want to be some type of counselor. I would love to be an academic advisor (did some of this at chico workstudy). The only path i can think of with a grad degree is an MFT position (im not into clinical psych).. would a general counseling masters get me into both?",

They would know a lot more about this process. I've heard that they have networks/connections that could potentially help you find employment.",

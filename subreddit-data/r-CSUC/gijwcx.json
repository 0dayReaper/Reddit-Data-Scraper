I'm glad to see they're making exceptions, however stringent, for practical lab based classes/internships. \n\nI'm really interested to see, though, what this does both for the local economy (now that students, frankly, don't need to stay on campus or even in town unless they need a lab) and for enrollment, especially following the slide post-Camp Fire. There either needs to be a considerable drop in tuition, or a roughly equivalent change elsewhere to avoid a dearth of students just throwing their hands up and going \"Fuck this, [an online focused program] is cheaper/more prepared.\"",

For example, I believe they will try to empower the 6ft physical distancing rule by limiting students in a single section and/or moving into larger rooms.\n\nI'm not sure what CAGD's plans are. For what it is worth, I teach Computer Science and Software Engineering in particular, which usually requires face-to-face team meetings but I did *not* argue that it was essential to teach my classes in person.\n\nMy hunch is that most classes that require specific equipment (including software) that can't be distributed will still meet in person. However, if you're trying to make decisions about renting locally or staying at home, I'd suggest reaching out to your department chair and asking them.",

I know because I use all of the software we use for our major on my personal computer.\n\nThe school has also been providing hardware to students who don't have any in order to complete courses. It's possible what they are providing can better handle the software than your personal stuff.\n\nAnd another option is grants and scholarships being offered through the school and outside of the school. All you would need is maybe ~600 dollars give or take to build a desktop PC that could run those programs decently fast.\n\nI feel ya, CAGD stuff has been really hard on me too, being online, but all the professors are working really hard as we speak to prepare for the fall to make it as painless as possible. If you have even more concerns or want more specific help, absolutely reach out to Jennifer, more likely than not, she's your advisor anyway, and is more than happy to provide you with any help or information she can.

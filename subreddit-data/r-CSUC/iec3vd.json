Of course I have no information on Blackboard that could inform me of how to attend class online so that I may possibly attempt to add.\n\nNever been waitlisted for an online class before so basically I don't know how this is supposed to go down.\n\nI emailed the professor and all he responded with was \"everything is controlled through the wait-list system, it's out of my hands.\"",

Emailed the professor and was told they had already over enrolled the class by 20 people so the waitlist was effectively pointless. I\u2019d keep that in mind and have a back up class so you meet your unit requirement.",

If you have already messaged the professor he obviously knows your situation and should understand that you couldn\u2019t be there for the first class. \n\n\nCalling the registrar office on Monday morning may be the best option, they would know how this information has changed during these COVID times.",

Come the second week of classes, the waitlists turn off and any open seats are fair game. If you aren't in the class by next week, you probably won't get in for the semester.",

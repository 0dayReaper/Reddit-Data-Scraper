Sort of off campus, but tbh it\u2019s nice the kitchen is big. You share the space with like 14 other people so not too bad. most konkow people I know are close to their suitemates.",

            "comment": "I lived in konkow my first year. compared to Sutter, it is definitely cheaper. Konkow is in north campus and like a 5-10 minute walk. In konkow, you share a kitchen, living, and dining room with 12+ people. you do have chores but they are shared with everyone. overall, I really liked being able to cook meals if I didn\u2019t want to go to the dining hall (you get bored of dining hall food). I got along well with all my housemates and it was definitely more quiet and peaceful than other dorms on main campus. I would recommend living in konkow.",

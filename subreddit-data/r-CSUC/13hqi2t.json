I\u2019m trying to find the easiest online class I can take that transfers since I already have a full time job and couldn\u2019t care less about the class. It\u2019s to satisfy my unit requirement, not any class, so its open to anything",

            "comment": "This is highly subjective. First, are you certain they can be classes taken at a cc and don't need to be taken at Chico?\n\nIf yes, then this should be asked of students at your local cc. I can tell you what classes and profs I found easy at my cc, but it's probably not the same at your school.\n\nEnroll at your local cc and start looking at classes. Electives are probably going to be your best bet. If you regularly go to the gym, find a weight training class that fits your schedule. My cc offers a 1 unit weight training class. Other classes, like art, typically require a lot of outside time and I'm not artistic so I stay away from those. You need to find what works for you. Utilize ratemyprof and try talking to a school counselor about what they recommend.\n\nGood luck!",

Find something that is approved for transfer (your counselor will be able to help you with that). And again, check rmp for prof reviews. No one here can tell you what to take. I took general psych and every answer was A in the quizzes. Easiest class I've ever had, but it depends on the prof. Your school will be different (probably) than mine, and every prof is different. I'd suggest enrolling in 6-9 units and drop whatever looks hardest.\n\nMy cc is in finals week (like Chico) this week. It will be more difficult to contact people after this week and summer classes will start filling up faster. Get in contact with an advisor this week if you can.",

Apply and get in to Theater 14A , B or C (depending what types of movies you like) (but over summer they have only 14B online asynchronously and it\u2019s about musicals and westerns (wasn\u2019t a bad class) and all you do is watch one movie a week and write a discussion post response and take a quiz and thats it. Easiest A of my life and it counted as a lower division GR course for CSU transfer. But it is a 3 unit class. To get that extra 1 unit do golf or yoga or any of the kinesiology classes that are like a sport",

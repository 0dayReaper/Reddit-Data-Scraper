    "postText": "Hi, I'm a male freshman CSCI student looking to move into apartments next year, and have been considering a 2Be/1Ba remodeled apartment at Pine Tree. I don't drink or smoke personally, and not big into the party scene. It would be a joint lease, about a 20 minute walk to campus. Message me if interested!",

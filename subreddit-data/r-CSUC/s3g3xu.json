I don't think they'd make the effort to fight for tuition reimbursement though since student union fees are part of what students pay when they attend Chico State.",

Most lab costs are covered by donations and fed/state grants for those labs\n3. During online only we had several dozen budings sitting unused and locked up, should have been a dream for grounds keeping\n\nLong and short is while there are costs associated with running a campus of that size, if you do not do everything on the campus you shouldn't be expected to pay full cost for access to it. That's like paying full on ticket price for watching a movie at home, just plain silly.",

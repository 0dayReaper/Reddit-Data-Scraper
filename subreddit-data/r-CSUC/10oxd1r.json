    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a 1st year student at CSUC, and I was supposed to do the ALEKS placement exam for math. However, I completed it during last weekend, and I am eligible to take the Calculus course. Is it recommended to add a notably difficult course such as Calc after the first week? Will I be far behind? How much work will I have to do to catch up? I ask this not only because the course would definitely be hard, but I think the class meets around 3 times a week, so they probably went over much stuff.",

This would probably be the best way to go about figuring it out",

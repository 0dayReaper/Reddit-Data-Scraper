People from both sides of the Senate were recently found to have bought loads of Pfizer and BioNTech stock just before the vaccines rolled out.  Pfizer profited some $36 billion last quarter. If the vaccines don\u2019t work, they\u2019re not going to tell you. They\u2019re making a literal fuckton of money right now. They switch up every few weeks on what the new science is because they literally do not know. Science takes years to develop. Fauci is an educated guesser at best, but him, Trump, Biden, and a whole lotta Congressmen are lining their pockets right now. You should still get vaccinated, but at least see through the deception and see exactly why they are mandating this.",

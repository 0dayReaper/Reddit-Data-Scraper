Are there problems with classes filling up too fast and people not being able to get credit, having to delay their graduation due to lack of credit?(this situation seems to occur at Sacramento campus)\n4.How is dorm life and living for students\n5. Part time jobs on campus\n6. Campus placements and internships opportunities",

                    "comment": "Agree!^\n\nI've never had issues with enrolling either, although I was in a different major.\n\nThe atmosphere in Chico is very community oriented. There's definitely a lot of parties and always things to do outside, if you like hiking or going to the river. There's a lot of clubs on campus and I definitely recommend going to \"Choose Chico Day.\" Social life is very active, as long as you can step outside your comfort zone and find your group. Summers and Winters are more quiet (students usually go home), which I enjoy. We're an hour away from Sacramento and about 3 hours away from San Francisco, if you want to explore bigger cities.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have anymore questions!",

The fairs I've attended have had around 50 different companies showing up.  It's not uncommon for CS students here to get jobs with Google and Amazon.  HP also hires a good deal of Chico alumni.  Lots of great opportunities.  Have you reached out to the [department chair](https://www.csuchico.edu/csci/people/faculty/henry-tyson.shtml) yet?  He's really cool.",

Classes hardly ever fill up if you keep up with your enrollment dates. \n\nCan\u2019t comment on dorm life as I went straight to off campus housing. But I have heard from friends that it\u2019s a great experience. Lots of parties and stuff around campus if your into that. \n\nI work part time for the college dining. 20 hrs a week, 17 sum thing an hour. Balance it pretty well with my classes",

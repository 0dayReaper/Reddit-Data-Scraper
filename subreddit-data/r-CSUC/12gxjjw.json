    "postText": "Hi! Im an incoming freshman returning from a gap year and I\u2019m currently narrowing down my options for housing and would need two roommates for one of the places I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019m moving with my twin brother and we have our eyes on a 4 bed 2 bath with offered individual leases. I\u2019m asking through here because I\u2019m not certain if Pomona has roommate matching services. But anyways, I\u2019m looking for people around my age (19) who\u2019d be willing to vibe with us. I\u2019d like to say we\u2019re both pretty social people and we get along with mostly everyone. We both are definitely big into cannabis and are looking for new experiences to be had. If you\u2019re interested shoot me a dm and I\u2019ll run more stuff down with y\u2019all.",

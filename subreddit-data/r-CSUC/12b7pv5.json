    "postText": "Hi! My son will be an incoming freshman this fall. He originally was leaning towards University of Oregon or University of Arizona. After receiving the financial award letters, and realizing it would cost between 40k and 60k out of pocket, he reconsidered his CSU options. \n\nHe is now debating between Chico and Fullerton. We toured Fullerton today. The campus is very nice, but a majority of the students commute. I think that may take away from his college experience. \n\nWe have not toured Chico yet. We live in So Cal, so it\u2019s not an easy campus to get to. \n\nAny recommendations about which school he should choose? \n\nDo you think it is necessary to visit Chico in order for him to decide, or do the virtual tours do it justice?\n\nI know he needs to commit prior to May 1st, but he also needs housing on campus. I\u2019m nervous that the longer he waits, the less chance he will have of securing a spot in a dorm. \n\nAny insight you may have would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Coincidentally, I also decided between Chico and Fullerton when I graduated high school. Obviously I ended up going with Chico state and never regretted that decision at all. \n\nAs others have said, I\u2019ve only heard of Fullerton as being more of a commuter college with less of a traditional college experience whereas Chico is on the other end of that spectrum. So it\u2019s something to consider if that\u2019s a factor in his decision. Chico itself is relatively small, but is basically built around the college with downtown Chico being right on the edge of campus. Campus is beautiful; lots of trees and a creek running through the middle. It feels a lot bigger than it really is.\n\nI not sure how the virtual tour is, but I\u2019ve been to plenty of other campuses (SDSU, San Jose, Sac state, Berkeley, San Francisco, to name a few) and still firmly believe Chico is the best overall in terms of nature, walkability, and just overall vibe. Albeit, that\u2019s just my biased opinion. Oh, and it also gets stupid hot in the summers, like \u2018well over 100 degrees on a consistent basis\u2019 type of hot. So also something to consider lol\n\nBut at the end of the day, college is what you make it and I think you can\u2019t really make any wrong decisions. I don\u2019t know if any of this helps but I hope it at least gives some insight! Good luck!",

I'm not convinced about the town itself (it is winter, after all) but the school is impressive with a classic East Coast college feel, nice old buildings, good dorms and modern amenities throughout. Looks like it would be a great, traditional, non-commuter experience. I've toured a lot of other California and out-of-state schools and Chico State ranks right up there. I'd say the campus and town are reminiscent of Oregon State in Corvallis. Kind of amazed it is still relatively easy to get accepted.",

Chico is a great town that will offer a fantastic college experience, much better than Fullerton although it is there on a much smaller scale.  I lived on campus basically and there are things that can appeal to you as a student.  At Fullerton you have everything that SoCal has to offer.\n\nIt really should come down to the major.  Chico has some advantages over Fullerton academically and Vice versa.\n\nOne warning about Chico, it is much more difficult to get a job there.  You\u2019ll see tons of job openings, but almost every employer avoids hiring students if at all possible.\n\nI personally loved going to CSUF but it made sense based on my major.  I lived in Chico after CSUF and I would move back there in a heartbeat if I could.",

I think you still get the full college experience regardless of whether it\u2019s a commuter school or not. Chico is a cute little town and I am from the SLO area and can second that in some ways it does mimic that area which for me was a big plus. Some thing to consider is which program being offers t is better.  Whether you want a smaller college town vibe or a big city college vibe. Because the two are so different I\u2019d have to say you should definitely visit chico. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and has a charm that sets it apart from most CSU campuses.",

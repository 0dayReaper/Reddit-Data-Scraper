    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming transfer.\n\nDoes CSU Chico have any resources or online communities (besides this subreddit) that can be used to find potential roommates? I'm under the assumption that we can request roommates before the official matching process begins.\n\nOr, if you're reading this and are okay with a 21 y/o male roommate, let me know. I'm a CIS major and don't do anything except study and work. I have no interest in drinking, smoking (weed), partying, having fun, or socializing (not going to be bringing friends over or staying out late). I work full-time remotely so I'm usually at a cafe or library for ten to twelve hours a day every single day. That's pretty much it.\n\nThank you.",

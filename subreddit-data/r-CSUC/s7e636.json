    "postText": "Hi, I have recently been accepted to Chico State and San Francisco State as an International Relations (IR) Major. I\u2019m very indecisive about which university to accept, considering I love the area of San Francisco and I am worried that Chico will be a boring small town. Also a big problem for me is that CSUSF has a reputation of being a commuter school and I really want to have a fun college experience, which I know Chico will guarantee.\n\nAnother big concern for me is how well the International Relations programs at each school will prepare me for my career, in terms of internship opportunities, etc. \n\nAny input would be appreciated.\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I think you pretty much hit on the major differences.  Twelve years ago I was in your exact shoes.  SF or Chico.  I went with Chico.  The City probably would have made me grow up a little faster, had more opportunity, more unique experiences.  But I have this feeling I would have felt alone.  I get this from both my own perception of living in the Bay area but also my girlfriend.  She went to SF City College then San Jose State.  There is of course much personal choice involved, but her stories of spending hours on BART to get to and from school all alone at 18 I found heart breaking.  This is all just pure anecdote and if you feel in your gut you'd do better in a city, by all means you should pick SF.  Regardless, I feel confident in saying I was much happier in Chico.  I studied with my best friends every day and we rode our bikes 5 minutes to eachother's houses after for drinks.  Peace and nature was never more than a few minutes away from my front door.",

Chico state has a college town that definitely has contributed to the great experience I\u2019ve had here. When I was applying to school, I never heard one person say that they didn\u2019t like their time here. And it applies for myself too.",

I was in the same spot as you a few months ago and when I compared the two academically Chico was a lot better than SF plus it\u2019s cheaper and has a better social atmosphere. SF is only worth the money if you know people out there already and have a car (since it\u2019s mostly a commuter school) but getting a car up there is tricky. If you look at the campuses too SF is a really sad looking school whereas chico is more welcoming and i\u2019ve heard people in Chico are generally a lot nicer than most.",

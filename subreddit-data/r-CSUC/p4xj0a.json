Is this grant free money that is given to the student like a pell grant, or is this money that goes straight to tuition costs, that the student will never see? \n\nMy tuition is already being covered by the GI bill, so I would love it if I could get this grant personally.",

The disbursement is in a few days and it's not a big deal as either way my tuition will be covered, just the statement threw me - it seemed it would be odd that it showed up in my package to accept if I weren't getting both.  I guess I'll find out in a few days!",

Whew - it's my last year and my grants last year (at SDSU) were not nearly as good (in fact I think I only had federal loans and the middle class scholarship) so I was pretty happy when I had so many grants this year.  It would've been all right, but still a bit of a bummer if I was only getting one!",

It is called a disbursement. I believe that it is happening this Thursday, so make sure you have your direct deposit information already inputted in your Chico state student portal.\n\nEdit: actually I\u2019m not sure about that specific grant, so it could be different. But that\u2019s how it works for most other grants like federal grants",

There are plenty ty of places with easy work (especially compared to military shit) that will hire you if you have that work study budget. Dm me if you have more questions!",

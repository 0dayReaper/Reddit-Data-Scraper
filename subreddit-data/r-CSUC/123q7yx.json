I like the look of the campus as well as the lower expenses, but what is their History Dept. like? I am also looking to acquire my teaching credential at the same time so any information or suggestion would be helpful.",

I believe two professors had retired but maybe their spots have filled up. The history club is pretty awesome! My only problem was finding classes I ACTUALLY was interested in and wanted to take.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a business major but I was thinking of getting in to the history major because history is a side passion of mine. I\u2019ve met with a few professors who are nice and the director of the program is a really nice guy. I think you would like it. \n\nHowever I will say, I transferred in fall 2021. I\u2019ll be graduating fall 2023. With the increase in students coming back to the area , yes the cost of living is lower however you will have a hard time finding work to give you reliable and reasonable hours. I\u2019ve had to leave multiple jobs because they won\u2019t give me more than 8-12 hours per week. And on a $15/ wage you need to be working at least 15-20 hours a week to make rent and pay bills here. (Assuming you also get financial aid) Which isn\u2019t terrible if you have roommates or live with a partner. A lot of businesses here like to hire multiple college kids and give them minimal hours. \n\nThat\u2019s also not the case for only college kids. My fianc\u00e9 has been trying to find full time work since he\u2019s about to lose his current full time job due to his work shutting down and there\u2019s nothing much out here. \n\nThe school overall is great, I\u2019ve met great professors, nice people, lots of on campus resources, and it\u2019s nice to get everywhere you need to go to in town within 10-15 min. But if you\u2019re looking also at cost of living, I\u2019d suggest maybe trying to stay home with family and go to a local university. The job market is tough. Unless of course you have parents willing to help pay for things.",

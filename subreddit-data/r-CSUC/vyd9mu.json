    "postText": "Good day to you all, \n\nI am a student currently doing summer research at Chico State. My project consists of hooking up and controlling a Skywatcher NEQ6 PRO telescope mount in order to view a solar eclipse that is going to happen in a couple of months out in the pacific ocean. \n\nOur current issue is that we ordered and received the incorrect RJ12-to-USB cable for connecting to the SynScan remote to our computer in order to be controlled through EQAscom.  We now believe that it would be better if we connect our PC directly to the mount using a 9pin serial-to-USB cable instead. This type of cable is specially made for connecting to telescope mounts.\n\n file:///C:/Users/beguerra/Lynx%20Astro%20FTDI%20EQDIR%20USB%20Adapter%20for%20Sky-Watcher%20EQ6%20or%20NEQ6%20Syntrek%20&amp;%20PRO%20Mounts%20\\_%20First%20Light%20Optics\\_files/lynxastro\\_eqdir\\_sw\\_dsub\\_new.jpg \n\nUnfortunately most suppliers of this cable are overseas and ordering from them would mean we would have to wait about a month to receive it. Time we do not have due to the fact the telescope must be ready and shipped out by mid-August. \n\nIf anyone has this type of cable we would be willing to compensate you if you were willing to lend or sell it to us. Additionally, if you know anyone that might have what we are looking for we'd really appreciate it if you let us know. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read through this.",

Probably best to upload it somewhere like [https://imgur.com/](https://imgur.com/) and post the link from that.",

You don't need to buy a special \"astro\" cable.\n\nIf you look for \"USB to RS-232 DB9 FTDI\" on amazon, there are plenty of those available with 2day shipping.\n\nIf you have some experience with electronics and a DB9 connector laying around, you could also use the cable you have with the RJ12 plug and replace that with a DB9.  \nhttps://stratusengineering.com/rs232-9-pin-pinout/",

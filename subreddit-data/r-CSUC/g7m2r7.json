    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was recently accepted into Chico State after transferring from a community college in the Bay Area. I would need to find an apartment for the year, and I don\u2019t want to sign a lease and pay rent if classes will be held online. I was also accepted into San Jose State, but I would prefer to move out of my house. I don\u2019t want to commit to Chico state without knowing if I will be able to attend classes in person once the COVID pandemic is over. It doesn\u2019t make financial sense to lease an apartment and move my life to Chico, just to attend online classes. Does anyone know when in-person classes will resume? Does anyone know if the university is planning on reaching out to new and returning students regarding the upcoming fall quarter? I\u2019m certain I am not the only person that is concerned about finding living accommodations during this stressful time. Thank you guys, any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar corrections",

However, they are preparing to go online once more if needed. Take this with a grain of salt, as no one really knows what is going to happen. All we can do is wait and see what happens. Sorry that doesn't really answer your question, but the most legitimate answer from what I have heard is \"maybe.\"",

With the paradise fire apartments are hard to come by, so it might be a good opportunity.\n\nAlso, to my knowledge most apartments require a year lease, so that could be a problem.",

Here is what was posted on their website a few days ago: \n\n\nClarification on fall semester from Provost Pamella Oliver:\n\nIt is the complete hope of Cal State Fullerton to have traditional instruction in the fall. But like every university in America, we are working through the many unknowns of the current pandemic.\n\nThere were reports I said that Fullerton is cancelling classes and going fully virtual for the fall. Let me be clear, that is false. What I said is -that we need to prepare for all variables. Our goal is face to face, on campus instruction, however, we are asking faculty to be prepared to start the semester teaching virtually. This is the correct and prudent choice.\n\n\nhttp://coronavirus.fullerton.edu",

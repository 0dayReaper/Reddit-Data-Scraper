    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m currently in the process of looking at other colleges to transfer from UW and noticed Chico which seems much more of my type of vibe. I\u2019ve seen a couple of posts talking about how the css program is pretty good. But I was wondering, for anyone in the css major, is it competitive and difficult to get into? Specifically, what would you say is the average gpa to get in? Thanks in advance!!",

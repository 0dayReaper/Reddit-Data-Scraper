I was planning on getting my adn in , and I heard that there is a bridge program from Butte college to Chico state. I just went through four years of UCLA and I'm not sure how much financial aid I would receive while doing the BSN in Chico.  Does anybody have any experience with this?",

While going through Butte, you may get an extra point, but your ability to get into the program here is entirely based on objective measures delineated on the nursing homepage for our university. You can see the [point breakdown](https://www.csuchico.edu/nurs/_assets/documents/bsn-points.pdf) there",

    "postText": "I graduated from my university last May and suddenly just a week or so ago I received a letter from a law firm representing an LLC to collect a debt I wasn't aware I owed to my university bookstore from early 2021. It's from over 2 and 1/2 years ago and I've never been contacted about this???\n\nNeither the book store or my campus never made me aware of any late books I believed I had returned everything and there was no issues renting ans returning books or my cap and gown every other semester after the one it claimed I had late books for. I called my book store thinking I could have them back me up to contest the probable scam and they said I did have those books missing on file. They told me I wasn't made aware because the unvisersity book store is a separate entity whixh is why it never showed up on my student portal or affected me renting more books or graduating.\n\nI'll admit my mistakes and pay the fee since end of the day it's my fault weather I was aware or not. But they're wanting me to pay somthing like 1100$ with the fees added.  I'm in my early 20s with no idea how to proceed or what to say on the phone and don't have any cool slick lawyer dudes to ask for advice. \n\nDo I just tell them I want to pay it?\nDo I dispute the fees attached and ask to only pay the cost of the books listed in this letter? \nHow do I keep it from affecting my credit score?\nCould it still be a scam?\nWhy was I not informed up untill now if the book store had my debt on file?\n\nThe letter has a validation notice with itemization for each of the 4 books so I assume I can't request a verification of debt.\n\nI just don't wanna do somthing really stupid with this \n:(",

If you pay any bit of it the law assumes you owe all of it. It\u2019s silly but it\u2019s how it works. \n\nTell them you need to see their paper trail since yours is packed away and it would cause too much of a hardship to access just to correct their error. They\u2019ll probably just go away. It seems like they\u2019re just casting a wide net and seeing who pays up based on shoddy paperwork. If they had their shit together you would\u2019ve heard years ago.\n\nIt could also just be a scam.",

You want them to think you\u2019re not going to bother going to look for it until they provide more evidence. For instance, the receipt is in a box in a storage unit which I\u2019m not digging through right now. Prove I owe you this money or pound sand.",

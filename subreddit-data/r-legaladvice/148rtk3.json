    "postText": "Hello, and thanks for reading. If something here needs modifying to be posted, please let me know. I've posted here in the past about something else, and it was removed but I couldn't find any reason based on the rule cited. I'm desperate for help. I'll try to make this clear and succinct.\n\nMy mom is 68 and has worked so hard all her life. She worked as a waitress at a local place the last ten years. This year they announced they were closing 3/18. On 3/12, my mom stumbled and her femur broke severely at the hip. She had emergency surgery, having most of the bone replaced with a metal rod. She was in rehab for a few weeks, overall away from home 3 or 4 weeks.\n\nOn April 22, I helped her file unemployment. This was 41 days (a day short of six weeks exactly) since her fall. \n\nThey denied it because she didn't file for six weeks. We appealed, saying that she waited so long to apply because the medical stuff.\n\nThey denied again, saying that she willingly left because she couldn't work. We appealed that, providing a letter from the owner of the restaurant saying that she was laid off due to the closing, and her last date was  3/18. \n\nWe had a phone hearing with mom and the restaurant owner, who verified that again.\n\nAn hour later they denied it again.\n\nMy parents are 68 and 71, in declining health, and can barely make ends meet. My father mows lawns in 90 degree weather and has very arthritic knees. We're all beside ourselves with worry, and unemployment would really help them. She worked on her feet at that place for 10 years. Had it not been closing, she'd have been there working again as soon as she healed. It's so unfair, and makes no sense.\n\nI'm just hoping someone may have some advice to get them this help. Thanks for reading.",

            "comment": "If she had a short term disability policy she should have filed for disability. At this point it's unlikely she's going to get unemployment because she wasn't able or willing to work when her employer closed (because of her injury). She also missed the filing deadline and you can't use \"medical\" stuff as the excuse because her injury prevented her from working again again her unemployment would have been denied if she had applied back in March.",

    "postText": "Almost 2 years ago I got my house (Montgomery County PA). It was built in 1983 at which time our neighbor already had a garage whose foundation is 1ft from the property line. At some point the neighbor added a small wooden retaining wall and concrete drainage trough attached to the garage, and these go over the property line. Here's a pic with pink string showing the line: https://imgur.com/a/NcQNHrM  \n\n\nThe 10 feet on our side of the line has been a forest and the neighbor claims to have helped maintain it over the years though it shows no sign of recent maintenance.   \n\n\nI would like to put up a fence to retain my dog. I told them I plan to put it on the property line but they are saying that it should bend so as give some clearance around the garage. \n\n  \nIn addition to \"hire a real estate lawyer\" do you have any advice on fence placement or if I should be considering some sort of adverse possession (although it was never hostile to my knowledge) rights?",

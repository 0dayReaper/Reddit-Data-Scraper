    "postText": "Legal document review. Kia had 13k vehicles damaged in West Point GA with hail damage. They are discounting the cars by 2k and giving 2y of free service. They use PDR on the vehicles to remove the dents and replacing any panels that were not able to be repaired. They are making customers sign a release document. \n\nThe question I have is does the normal paint warranty apply or are they releasing themselves from any and all liability of any future issues with the vehicles repairs?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\r  \nCUSTOMER REPRESENTATION AND RELEASE\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nVEHICLE MODEL:\r  \n\r  \nVIN:\r  \n(The vehicle bearing this VIN number is referred to below as the \u201cVehicle\u201d)\r  \n\r  \nThe   undersigned   (\u201cCustomer\u201d)   has   agreed   to   purchase   or   lease   the   Vehicle   from\r  \n(\u201cDealer\u201d) and to use the Vehicle.

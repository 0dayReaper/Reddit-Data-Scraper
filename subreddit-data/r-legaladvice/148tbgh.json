    "postText": "Tell me does this sound like it could be a wrongful termination case? So my husband was working as management at a restaurant and he called in sick one day brought in a sick note by a doctor which they can't argue. Then after that he continuously asked what his schedule was which they refused to provide, he showed up with documentation of his hip fracture and even showed up with documentation of his Ortho telling him he can only work 6 hours at a time and they decided to fire him. They said they are firing him because he did not show up on his schedule. Which he has in text proof that he asked multiple times for. Considering he has a torn ligament and broken hip could there be any statutes to support this? We are in Virginia which I know is a fire at will state. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

The six hours was him trying to get reasonable accommodations, they forced him to go to the Dr. and he provided the note stating 6 hours would be his reasonable accommodation, which they never offered any accommodations after finding out he has a broken hip. He also just found out he has a blood borne pathogen (hepatitis) that needs to be treated and he warned them multiple times it needs to be treated before handing others food. They ghosted him and refused to respond to the questions he asked about coming into work, as well as withholding his schedule.",

Without any attempts at accommodation which he acquired his accommodation requirements like they asked. Then lied and said he received his schedule when he had not. He has lengthy documents of proof asking repeatedly for his schedule and whether or not they'd be willing to accommodate. They had agreed to speak with him, and never showed up. Then hid his schedule from him, to say they fired him for \"missing work\" which he tried for days to receive.",

I had proof of the obituary but was still fired as soon as I got home. I asked a similar question (not on Reddit, but on a workers law Facebook group) and was told I had no legal case, as I\u2019m in an at-will state. That could be totally incorrect information, and I hope for your husband\u2019s sake it is, but unfortunately that\u2019s what I was told",

He was completely eukking to work, and they were withholding his schedule, as well as not providing accommodations cleared by his orthopedics. He called so many times to try and get a schedule as well as messaged both his bosses asking to speak to them, so that they also knew he was working with a blood borne disease that was just diagnosed. They planned to meet and his bosses didn't show. Unfortunately, he hasn't been there for over a year yet, so fmla won't apply.",

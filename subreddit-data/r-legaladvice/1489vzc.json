    "postText": "Hello everybody,\n\nI don\u2019t know where to go, because i don\u2019t understand shit at:\n1. Cars \n2. French law \nThe thing is, i bought a car a month ago at a garage that has used cars and such.\nIt had minor problems when i tried it (scratches, one tail light was ductaped, missing the part to straighten the driver seat, dashboard was changed bc of a problem so the car has 140.000km but it only show 95.000 on it\u2026)\nWell, I saw it as \u00ab\u00a0minor details\u00a0\u00bb at the time.\nSo I bought the car: Kia Cee\u2019d diesel from 2011 140.000km for 4990\u20ac, it has a warranty for the engine of 3 months and a another warranty for the rest of the car (idk what that entails) for a whole year, he said that the car is fine and made sure she was squeaky clean and with new tires.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal, first of all when my dad picked the car up it didn\u2019t have gas like, only enough to go to a gas station (i find that like\u2026poor customer attention?) but i was like oh well whatever. But then realised so was the windshield wiper liquid, the A/C doesn\u2019t work probably because it\u2019s empty also.\nI already called for the parts he said he would change he gave me an appointement and never showed up on said apt. \nStill i was like well whatever fuck you I guess but as long as it drives?\n\nBoyyyyyy was i wrong because now, my battery doesn\u2019t work i cannot start my car on my own I need another car to help me jumpstart it or i need the 100\u20ac booster that I bought?! I already called 2x he doesn\u2019t respond and doesn\u2019t call back it\u2019s been a week.. I even called the garage who did the technical control because my car didn\u2019t pass the first one and they made a second one not in the same shop? Isn\u2019t that weird??\n\nNothing makes sense and i don\u2019t know what to do? I don\u2019t have another 1.000\u20ac to fix everything nor to buy a new car\u2026\nI\u2019m sorry english isn\u2019t my first language but what can I do? Cry?\n\nThank you !",

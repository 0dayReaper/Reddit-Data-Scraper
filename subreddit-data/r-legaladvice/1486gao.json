    "postText": "I'm in NJ.\n\nI used a rebate website for at least 1.5 years and never had an issue. They sent the rebates back monthly if I had a balance. They have now skipped the last few and the 1 they did send bounced and my bank charged me a hefty fee (I will see if i can get it removed). I have close to a $1000 balance they owe me.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get them to pay (and would not cost more than the 1k balance)? They appear to still be operating. Their customer service does not respond and I noticed started deleting tickets I have opened. Would submitting a BBB complaint do anything? Is there anything else that can be done?",

Or don't want you as a customer any more. Many possibilities. But you need to explain what this is any why you are owed these \"rebated\" (if you are).",

    "postText": "I recently got mailed that I owe not a huge amount for a medical virtual visit I did last year. It was in August and they made me put my card information. So I guess I thought I paid it because it told me the amount owed and me putting in my card. I called and they told me oh yeah so we were working on a new billing system and we just now got to start billing everyone. We just had your card on file to have your card on file for the appointment. Doesnt make sense to me, I dont have access to the website anymore I think it was optum. So I dont know the langauge used I guess, but I dont remember seeing it said I wouldnt be charge right there and then. Wondering If I should just pay it or any way to contest it. Its not a crazy amount but im wondering if they are suppose to bill me as soon as possible, cause its almost been a year",

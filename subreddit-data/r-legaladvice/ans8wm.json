    "postText": "Right now my brother is threatening to \"sue\" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my \"little shit\" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said \"not good enough\" and hung up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",

Sometimes the law is a learning experience. \n\nUnrelated but a quick google search doesn't show any in box boba fett going for more than $500 or so, so your brother may be overvaluing his toy. \n\nEDIT: I stand corrected, there is a [Boba Fett figure worth $2000](https://gunaxin.com/valuable-star-wars-toy-collectibles) to someone. \n\n2nd EDIT: Please stop sending me personal messages if you absolutely must talk about this you can do so in the [bestoflegaladvice thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/ant669/so_my_teenage_son_stole_a_valuable_collectible/?st=JRTPN5OQ&amp;sh=bd1ee376)",

Your son did the wrong thing and should work hard to make it right.  Returning what is now worthless is not the same.    \n\n\nWould your brother and son be open to signing a payment agreement over a couple of years for the full value?  My kid would be out getting a job to pay for this, but with working hour restrictions it can take time to earn that much cash. ",

While finances may be tough your son damaged his property and he can get back the value from that. Your best bet is to work out a payment system with him. Additionally you can always try to find a replacement at a cheaper price. Also if money is tight, I suggest you get your son to work and start paying this off.\n\nedit: Thank you kind strangers for the silver and gold, i'm quite appreciative. \n\nedit2: more silver? wow thank you folks!",

    "postText": "FINAL UPDATE\n\nSo I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \n\n&lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      \n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\nHey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!\n\nMy location is Washington DC\n",

My concern is that if the Subaru dealer has an in-house body shop or works very closely with one, they may try to repair the car that might be a total loss. Particularly since the dealer is claiming the damage to be \"extensive\".  So yes, get a lawyer because in no way shape or form should YOU be responsible for ANY damages done to your car since it was an employee who wrecked it. Do not negotiate a \"deal\". Call your insurance company &amp; hire a lawyer. Good luck OP. ",

Depending on your policy, your insurance might be able to get you a rental and front the cost of getting the car repaired or replaced. You shouldn't be liable to pay for anything, but your insurance will battle it out with their insurance. Also, when the police arrive, I would see if they're willing to arrest the manager for driving your car without permission. He stole your car from my prospective, but the police might not see it that way, but it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nI would also contact Subaru's main office and let them know what their dealership did.",

There is implied or even expressed (in the terms and conditions OP signed when dropping off the car) that employees of the dealership will drive the car.\n\nIt is a legal grey area at best because a reasonable person would expect the garage to need to move the vehicle around the lot or even drive around the block but not do personal errands or break the law in their vehicle. Did the manager drive it home, to the grocery store, or to the movies? Did the manager wreck going above the speed limit or driving drunk or high? If he was negligent, then sue him and/or the dealership in civil court for all they are worth. But chances are this won't be settled in the legal system unless another crime was committed.",

Either option is 100% their liability, not yours. \n\nFirst of all, you said in another post they're telling you to pay for this replacement car which is 100% bullshit. If they're trying to make you do that, it's telling me you're going to need to get a lawyer involved for anything to happen. \n\nThis is going to be a shitty and rough ride I'm guessing, since they're in total CYA mode.\n\nEDIT: Another poster ( /u/thesheba ) recommended getting in touch with your insurance, and I'm adding that to this because I agree 100%, this is entirely what you pay them for and they have way angry lawyers who are used to dealing with automobile related tomfoolery.",

I'm glad he is okay but like you said they were using that as a lie to cover up the fact that they totaled the car.  I'm still looking into legal action that I should take.  From what I have seen I'm thinking I will get a new car and some money out of it.  As for him from the cops technically he did not steal it but right now he has been taken for driving recklessly and public property damage.  Further charges will be dependent on my lawyer.  My insurance is being really helpful.  The GM is denying all responsibility but it was his sales manager so I find it hard to believe he didn't know they were doing this stuff.  If mine was taken out like that I can only imagine how many more cars have been used for personal use.  More info to come once I go over with my insurance and laywer.  I'll be sure to post a final update of what came of it.  All the suggestions and comments are much appreciated Its really helpful to be able to read through all of them.    ",

You could be legally on the hook for anything that happens with it. You need a paper trail that documents officially what is happening as much as possible. Call the Police and let them know your car has been taken from the dealership without your permission, and ask the Police to meet you there. They will take some statements and the dealer will have a hard time weaseling out of telling them what's going on.\n\nBeyond that...\n\n1) They are indebted to you for damages arising from this. They will need to give your money back for the loaner car, or you can sue them for it back. In reality, you could just go pay to rent a car somewhere and then bill the dealership for it, and you will prevail in suing them if they do not pay it.\n\n2) Are they a standalone service center or also a dealership? If the latter, you can file a complaint with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, which regulates dealerships in the DC area. In fact, I would suggest calling them after the cops and asking if you can speak with an investigator. This is a pretty unusual-sounding and time-sensitive situation, so they may take an interest in helping to resolve.\n\n3) Once this is done, you'll need to take your car to another shop -- preferably a reputable one -- and have them look the car over in detail. The dealer will be responsible to you for any damage.\n\nDo not sit around and wait for them to do whatever it is they are doing.",

Not that they would compound the error by giving you theirs, but it ought to be there on their lot.\n\nGet a lawyer. You will want to get the truth out of them.\n\nWith or without lawyer, tell them you consider it stolen, and you are going to the police. See what they say.\n\nMy thoughts: 1) it actually was stolen\n\n2) they've wrecked it. They're surreptitiously trying to get it fixed.\n\nIf it does reappear, take it to another shop, a body shop, or, ideally, your insurance adjuster (and you may want to contact your insurer anyway, and see what they say. They may recommend the police) and have it examined for recent repairs.\n\nYou want the vehicle back in the same, or better condition. A repaired (body) vehicle is never the same.\n\nEdit: WRX?\n\nFavourite of car thieves, and, particularly, bank robbers. ",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were \"getting my car ready for pickup\" to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

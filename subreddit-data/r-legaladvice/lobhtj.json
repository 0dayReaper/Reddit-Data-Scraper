    "postText": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/?sort=top)\n\nSo to make a long story short, i called our local Audubon society. They didn't think feeding the crows was bad and suggested that the neighbors also start feeding them so they essentially became better socialized.\n\nThe plan worked and the crows are now a beloved part of the community. There have been no recent dive bombings.\n\nMost amazingly, the crows may have legitimately saved my neighbor. Our city had a pretty big ice and snow event recently. Like i said in my last post, most of my neighbors are older. One of my neighbors was walking down his steep driveway, slipped, and couldnt get back up.\n\nThe crows started going *ballistic* and were making more noise than we have ever heard. A different neighbor went outside to see what was up and found the gentleman in his driveway. Neighbor is mostly ok! Just some serious bruises. \n\nNeedless to say the crows have been getting some high value food since then.\n\nThanks for all the help on my original post. It blew up way more than i was expecting and i thought you guys would enjoy an update.",

    "postText": "My mom died late last year in Michigan. Her will named me as personal representative. Our attorney said I can get a fee for fulfilling the duties. My two sisters agree that I should take a few (the three of us are splitting the estate proceeds equally, as per the will). How do I calculate what to take as a fee?\n\nThings have been going remarkably smoothly. The estate totals less than $250k. The three of us have calmly and respectfully discussed what few issues have come up. We each took a few items and sold the rest. Mom\u2019s retirement account was already prepped so we just gave them the death certificate and they gave us each our share. I worked with the realtor (who went to school with family and knew mom well) to get the house sold: it got offers the first week on the market and closed in about 1 month. We set up an estate account with our attorney, the few small bills have been paid out of that. A few phone calls and emails with the paralegal are the extent of my interaction with the attorney. A family friend local to mom has been a huge help, and we agreed on a gift to her, paid out of the estate account.\n\nThe biggest thing I did: I made two trips from Colorado to Michigan, mostly because the house was full o\u2019 crap (not a hoarder situation, but on its way). I separately submitted expenses for reimbursement for those trips. I spent about 10 days total working to clean/empty the house.",

            "comment": "You might take a reasonable hourly fee relative to: \n\n1. The services you\u2019re providing to the estate (if you\u2019re doing clean up at mom\u2019s house you can\u2019t charge $100 per hour because you could contract the service at 1/2 - 1/3 that). \n\n2. What you might make otherwise in your efforts (if you\u2019re a barista your hours are capped in the teens or twenties of dollars per hour while if you\u2019re a lawyer they might be in the seventies or eighties or higher).",

If all the beneficiaries agree, it really doesn't matter how you calculated it.\n\nYour lawyer could probably put together a simple letter agreement that you all sign, stipulating that the number is reasonable, and waiving any complaint about you paying yourself that amount.  That avoid any disputes in the future.",

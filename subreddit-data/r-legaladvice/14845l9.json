    "postText": "Hello, I am in the middle of apartment hunting in New York and I had the opportunity to tour a certain place, which really peaked my interest. Great features and amenities.   \n\n\nUnfortunately like a dumbass I jumped the gun without reading the lease in its entirety and started filling this online lease out it. For reference the lease is broken down into sections like so; Housing Contract, \"Exhibit A, B, C\", Rules and Regulations,... etc. To proceed onto the next section you need to sign the previous one. While reading a certain policy in the Use of Property section. I was left very confused by the policy (I will be asking them to clarify). It is not a \"bad\" policy but instead a nuisance to deal with as it mentions having to register overnight. I am a bit worried though as I have already signed previous sections of the lease and while there are still other sections to sign, I am worried about being legally bound to this lease. Having a paper lease I could read it and at the end of the day say no I don't want this despite signing all of the lease, however I am not sure with an online lease. I understand that both parties have to agree and sign at the end of the day, however I do not want to be put in a difficult situation, assuming that they do proceed and sign the lease. I have only signed the Housing Contract portion of the lease which indicates the unit I would be receiving, the length of the lease and the number of rooms, contract amount, utilities, etc. If any knows, assuming they sign the lease, would I be bound to this lease agreement despite not signing all of the portions of the lease? Would I have to sign all the sections in the lease to then be considered bound?\r  \n\r  \nThank you for all your help! It is greatly appreciated.",

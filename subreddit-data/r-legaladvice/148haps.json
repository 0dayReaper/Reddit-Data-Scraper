    "postText": "Hello.   \n\nI have a plea offer on two cases and want a general opinion of it's a good plea or not.   I understand people are not lawyers and I'm just looking for a general opinion of the plea \n\nThe plea involves dropping one case of five charges ( this is a weaker case as I have evidence of no wrong doing ).   \nThe other case would have a criminal threatening charged dropped and one theft by deception charge dropped pending a deferred deposition and restitution.  I have spoken to council and I inadvertently sold equipment that was identical to my own property.  I got them confused but can admit I made a mistake.    \n\nWould pleaing to one theft by deception charge screw my chances of employment in the future?  My state doesn't have sealing or expunging.  The only option would be a governor pardon. \n\nThe charge would be a class E misdemeanor",

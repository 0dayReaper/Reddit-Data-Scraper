    "postText": "I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. \n\nI went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.\n\nI did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it\u2019s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I\u2019m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she\u2019s going to take me to court.\n\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we\u2019ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I\u2019d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\n\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for you guys I would\u2019ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. \n\nI feel good for following all the advice here.\n\n",

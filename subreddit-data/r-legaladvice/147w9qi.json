    "postText": "I have a degree in architectural drafting and I was wondering, what is the law regarding copying architectural drawings (floor plans, section views, what many would think of as \u201cblueprints\u201d)? Could you copy a structure identically without any legal issues? Could you copy it and draw a very similar structure and just say you took inspiration from the existing structure or plans? Are government buildings protected differently than residential homes? What about historic buildings or buildings that are no longer in use?\n\nMany times a set of plans come with a title block giving you information of the project such as who drew the plans or the group they work for, but a lot of times those plans are then shared online without any of that information presented. At that point would the plans be free to use? \n\nHas anyone ever faced legal consequences from copying a house design of another or using plans of others without permission?",

    "postText": "Hello, apologies in advance for the long post. \nI purchased my first home in April of 2021. The online listing advertised the home as a single family home on one acre. However the legal description on the listing described a 2acre parcel. So we put in an offer and also asked the seller to clarify. The sellers realtor told my realtor that the home was originally on a two acre parcel but the seller had split the lot before listing the home. I then proceeded to receive a VA appraisal which came back for more than we had offered and then we proceeded to move on with the sale. I never received any disclosures from the seller stating that he was in the process of splitting the land and the land had actually not been split when I purchased. I have a copy of an affidavit from our closing documents that the seller signed stating that the property description at closing was correct and he had no knowledge of any splits happening to the land. I thought everything was fine with the sale, until January 2022 when I was contacted by the titling company. The titling company stated that they pulled the wrong title during the sale and they needed me to quit claim the other acre back to the seller.  A few problems though, the appraisal that was done on the house included the second acre, I had been paying taxes on the second acre for almost a year, and my mortgage encompassed the second acre. I told the titling agency that I would absolutely not sign any paperwork without the authorization of my mortgage company. My mortgage paperwork clearly stated that if I quit claimed any property over without their approval, they could take my home. My mortgage company performed their own title search and decided to not allow a partial land transfer. At the time, the property was not actually split. The seller and his realtor went to the county post the sale and got two new tax IDs on the property that I had purchased. The sellers realtor then came to me and told me that I would need to manually \u201ctake the acre off my mortgage.\u201d I wasn\u2019t actually sure what that meant, so I got my own lawyer involved (family friend). My lawyer basically referenced the purchasing agreement which had the 2 acre description listed, plus all the other paperwork where I received no disclosure of a split. He also pulled another title report in September of 2022 which came back as no split had actually occurred. Because my mortgage company refused to do a land transfer, my lawyer friend told the sellers realtor that they would need to sue me and my bank for the one acre. That was last September of 2022. I have not heard from the seller or his realtor since, I\u2019m not sure if the seller was able to get compensation from the title agency insurance or his realtors insurance or not. I have a copy of the land split application from the seller. It was approved ten days before closing. There is a disclaimer on the form stating that if the county does not record the split within 6 months the application is null and void. Fast forward to now, I am trying to sell the home so I can move into a larger one (growing family). My realtor used a company to perform another title search which came back that the parcel I purchased (the one on my deed) no longer exists. There are now two new parcels. The split would have happened without my knowledge over a year and a half after I purchased the property. I\u2019m not sure if the seller or the county had the split completed. The county\u2019s BS&amp;A website lists the seller as owning the parcel and it lists me as the tax payer \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019m not well versed in real estate law and tbh this has been a first home buying nightmare. Should I file a quiet title suit? Or does anyone have a better suggestion on how to proceed from here?",

            "comment": "I've dealt with something similar. \n\nFirst off, ignore what the county BS&amp;A website says, as well as your realtor's title report says and head down the county's Hall of Records/County Clerk/County Recorder (whichever they call it in MI) and do two things:\n\n1. Pull the Tact Index book for your subdivision and locate and obtain a copy the recorded deed and mortgage where you acquired the property, as well as all subsequently recorded documents. This will show if there was a split, and what documents they provided to prove so. \n\n2. Run both your name and the previous owner's name through the General Index/Grantor Grantee index and do the same for the deeds &amp; recorded documents. This will capture anything that did not make it in the tract index. \n\nSecond, go to the county abstract office and obtain a property tax card for your property covering the last 10 years. If there is a split (as you suspect there is), get a copy of the same.\n\nThird, call a real estate attorney, not your family friend attorney, and tell them your findings from the county. They will take it from there. \n\nFourth (optional), call your mortgage servicing company (if your attorney suggests) and let them know what happened. They have a vested interest in all 2 acres, and will want to know if they lose half their acres they wrote a note on.",

Either the seller loses his claim, the title insurance pays out, or there's bona-fide fraud going on. But you'll need that attorney to make sure you get the full extent of any of those scenarios.",

I would approach whatever dept handles assessing in your municipality to get THEIR record straight (which is totally separate from the Registry of Deeds). It sounds like your seller began the subdivision process and it was not concluded before selling the entirety to you. That's his problem. And towns/cities can be doing things based on outdated title info. You or your lawyer can do that. Your title company is only going by what's recorded at the Registry. Sounds like they looked again and found no issue because there was none. Then sit back and wait for Mr Seller to sue you. If what you have said here is true, he is going to have one heck of a time getting his supposed land back.",

I really think that the records will indicate that the seller screwed up, not the title company. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t recorded, it is not possible for the title company to find. Oftentimes, the title company runs a search a month or two in advance and another a day or so before you close to make sure nothing new happened.\n\nI would really just contact them and see what they say before spending your own money on a lawyer.",

They are purely for tax assesment purposes. \n\nThe municipality that did the \u201cland split\u201d/subdivision did it because they probably recieved the filed and planning board approved map for the new parcels.  They should not have followed through on the subdivision because there is no deed filed actually transferring either of the parcels. You still own both acres. Even if the parcel you purchased no longer exists (because it was subdivided) the two new parcels should be in your name. \n\nDeeds are what transfer land and hold title to it. You have a deed into your name for 2 acres. Even if that subdivision was processed by your municipal Real Property office, both those tax parcels should still be in your name. You should call your local assessor, or county Real Property tax office or Tax mapping department or Clerks office to get that straightened out. \n\nFYI Real estate agents don\u2019t know shit. They just sell houses. They are not lawyers, land surveyors, title searchers, etc. don\u2019t trust the info they give you. \n\nThe land part of this should be fairly cut and dry. The seller intended to sell you one acre, but used the survey description of the full two acres instead of the new 1 acre subdivision. They can possibly file a correction deed, but it would be a cleaner title if a quit claim deed was filed transferring the other acre from you back to the initial owner. This would use the descriptions from the \u201cland split application\u201d. This document should include a approved and filed subdivision map with parcel A &amp; B on it. You can then sell your house/property using that new description \u201cas being parcel B on filed map x___\u201d. Etc. \n\nYou can also talk to your tax assessor and possibly get an apportionment value for the land you didn\u2019t own but payed taxes on. You probably wouldn\u2019t receive a refund from the county/town and it would be better for the prior owner to settle that difference with you. \n\nAs for the mortgage stuff, your lawyer should be able to figure that out for you. \n\nDefinitely get a good real estate attorney.",

You're now 10 Feet deep in an 8 foot hole. When you do get a lawyer for this, Have him communicate with the mortgage company's lawyers as well. They all have a stake in this. you're lawyers job will be to get YOU out from under all this. It's a good thing you are looking for a new place as this property will likely be tied up for a long while in court. Bad part is, this will likely be tied up for a long time in court. Which means you may likely need to either force a foreclose, or continue to pay on the property. THIS is why you need to have your lawyer work to get you out of this issue while the other two companies battle over the other BS.",

That would be their issue to get it right.  On any advice from the other real estate agent. They do not and never have had a fiduciary duty to you, only to the seller. Stop taking any advice from people that do not work for or have your fiduciary duty in mind!\n\nYou may also want to go to the state(I didn't see your state on the post-)Real estate board and file a complaint with them about the listing and sale. The listing said 2 acres, but the agent (or was aware of)and the seller both had filed to split the lot before the sale. This boarders on fraud and could be determined as such by the real estate board. Which is why real estate agents pay a lot for Errors or omissions insurance on every sale they do. \n\nAfter talking with a lawyer, I would also ask the question of sale with intent to deceive/land Fraud. \n\nEither way this \"Clouds the title\" and makes the property very hard to sell without full disclosure on the legal proceedings! Do not do a sale without disclosing this to the buyer.",

    "postText": "I was part of a company-wide reduction in force at the beginning of the year.  I was employed all of 2022 and made over $315 in average weekly wages, so when I filed for unemployment benefits for four weeks while I job searched, I expected there to be no issues.  However, my claim was denied and ultimately it came out that my previous employer (a huge multinational corporate) wasn't reporting to the state that I was employed by them.  The direct quote from the unemployment office was, \"The problem is, the employer did not report the necessary information.  All employers pay into unemployment for you claimants.  They are required to report the Ohio wages for all employees on a quarterly basis and it seems as though your employer did not do so.\"  Because of this, I had to request paystubs from my previous employer for all of 2022 and submit them to the unemployment office, which I did.  \n\nI just found out today that I have a hearing at the end of the month and am wondering what to expect.  Thankfully I have no experience with this and hope to never again, but would appreciate some insight into what this hearing might look like, if I need to have anything prepared, etc.\n\nThanks!!",

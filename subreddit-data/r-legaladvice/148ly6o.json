    "postText": "This is New York City and my friend is an at will hourly employee.\nMy friend is a store manager in my company. She had a relationship with her direct manager over the course of the last year. It recently ended poorly and since the manager has been extremely toxic in the way he treats her. \n\nShe requested a leave of absence to be able to get away from him for a short while, which was never approved, but she has ended up being taken off all her future shifts. After this request she brought the issue to HR and they have begun a formal investigation into this. \n\nWhile waiting for the investigation to progress she has tried to pick up regular shifts at different stores not under her original manager but was recently told she cannot work these shifts as she is a store manager and cannot work as a regular employee based on her higher pay, and there are no open store manager shifts in any of the stores. She's been out work for 3 weeks now and unsure of her next steps though is going to be looking for legal council soon.",

She requested a leave of absence but also wants to work?  Your two statements are incongruous.",

As it was not approved she is under the impression she could still take shifts in other stores that are not under control of that manager. This has been normal in the past where she worked other shifts at stores. But now she is told she cannot by HR due to her manager status",

She may even be able to collect unemployment under what appears to potentially be constructive dismissal as of three weeks ago.",

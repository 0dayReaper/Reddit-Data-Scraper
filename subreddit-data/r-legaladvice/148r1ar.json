    "postText": "Idk if I used the right flair, but heres the situation. \n\nI, 19f, live with my mother, 47f. I pay multiple household bills (water, wifi, contribute to rent, as well as buying my own groceries.) \n\nShe regularly invites over her exboyfriend, who I am terrified of, as well as his dog, who has destroyed my clothing before. My exstepdad is a violent drug user who frequently comes over drunk. Hes come over while on mushrooms twice in the past few months. When he still lived with us (when I was 13) he actually got violent and kicked in the car windows ans attacked the neighbors. I, at 13 years old, had to call the police while I was sobbing and terrified in my bedroom. He also punched holes in several walls over the years, and got violent with her several times. At one point he slammed the bathroom door while I was causing out, causing it to smash back into my nose.\n\nI have told her I do not want him here, and whenever he is here I leave the house just so I can feel safe. I have told her MANY times (over 60.) That this is my house too, I pay bills, and I have a say in who can be inside my home. \n\nI would like to add that our landlord does have a contract that states we cannot have any animals on the property besides our own, and by letting him bring his destructive dog over she is risking us getting evicted. I have repeatedly told her this too. \n\nSo what im asking is if there is any legal way to make her stop bringing him over? I do not feel safe and I do not have a way of moving out.\n\nEdit; wow! People seem to hate me over this. I should prob emphasize that the \"guest\" is abusive. My mother is also abusive but less. I am desperately looking for ANY way to survive until the day I can move out",

She is not obligated to provide any support to you.",

The only things that COULD be in my price range are houses for sale, and i can probably just barely afford mortgage payments. I probably wont even qualify for that because I've only had a bank account for a few months. My mother is controlling. Having a job is the first time ive been able to leave the house without her following me.",

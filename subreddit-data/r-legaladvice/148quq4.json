    "postText": "Lifelong friends of mine and I would like to start a trust that we would invest money into monthly. The ultimate goal would be to use the funds to jointly purchase a vacation house that would be held in the trusts name. Succession and ownership of the home would be spelled out in the trust as well as what the protocol is in the event someone wants to sell.\n\nIs this possible? Are we thinking of this correctly in assuming we need a trust before we even start pooling funds? Or would something as simple as a boilerplate business agreement work?\n\nThanks",

What you're thinking is a reasonable way to think about it.  Are you very very confident that you're going forward with this in a way and at a pace that justifies the costs of getting started?  Are you very very confident that 1) everyone involved will fulfill and 2) there won't be some falling out?",

I\u2019m actually the one that raised the hand and said we need to pump the breaks for the sake of protecting everyone.\n\nAs for friendship fallouts that\u2019s what I was hoping a trust could help protect. Clearly outlining the trust, it\u2019s objective, and protocols would help mitigate this in my mind.",

And what and how you might get yours back out when you leave. \n\nIt can\u2019t stop, for the most part, someone saying \u201cI\u2019m not sending any more money.\u201d Which is something that may send your plans into the ditch.",

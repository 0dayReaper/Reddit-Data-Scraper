It\u2019s not a given.\n\nThen if there is a marriage there\u2019s need to be an equitable division of community property.\n\nConcerning the child, there will need to be an determination of conservatorship / aka custody. There\u2019s a standard order. \n\nThere\u2019s no alimony in Texas and spousal support is rare.

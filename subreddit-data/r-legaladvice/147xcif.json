    "postText": "I 35F and my ex 40M have a 5 year old son together. We split a year ago (never married) and created a visitation schedule for him to see our son without the help of court. I let him choose set days he gets our son every week/weekend and for the past year he has gotten our son whenever it works for him due to his extremely inconsistent work schedule. I have not been able to do anything about it and have had no choice but to let him do this so my son can see him and spend time with him. I\u2019m finally putting my foot down and we are doing mediation to create a custody order so he has to abide by set days to see our son. \n\nFor the past year he has seen our son 2 days a week, inconsistent days of the week/weekend. We both agree on joint legal custody but he also wants joint residency in hopes to avoid child support if I ever try and bring him, but he told me that in person so I have no \u201cproof\u201d. I am not agreeing to joint residency as he doesn\u2019t get our son close to half of the time. \n\nHe told me to my face he\u2019s going to lie about having 3 set days in a row off of work to be able to \u201cqualify\u201d to have joint residency. If his plan we\u2019re to succeed, our son will be with a sitter a majority of those 3 days as his father still works a crazy schedule and has no intentions on seeking a new job since the money is so good. \n\nI don\u2019t have proof what can I do about this? I realize if we can\u2019t agree in mediation we will have to go to family court and I can\u2019t afford an attorney and make too much to get a free appointed attorney in court. Should I secretly record our next encounter to get it on video on my phone? We live in NY",

We will most likely end up in family court which sucks because we get along for the most part and I am very flexible about letting him choose the 2 days a week he wants. He\u2019s just getting greedy and wants to push for joint residency when he knows he won\u2019t get it without lying.",

You either agree in mediation or you don't and it goes to court. What you should do is a great question for the lawyer you should be hiring. What is your goal here? It sounds like you want him to have two set days a week but also like you think he should not have set days every week.\n\n&gt;Should I secretly record our next encounter to get it on video on my phone?\n\nNot unless your lawyer advises you to do so.",

My ex chooses to work a job that does not let him spend regular and meaningful time with my son. So he could easily change that by getting a new job that gives him set days off but he chooses not too. He only gets 2 days off a week so that\u2019s why i am not ok with him getting our son 3 days a week because the third day would always be with the sitter and I would rather my child be with me instead of with a sitter when he should be with his father. Again my ex is lying about having more days off of work than he gets to try and obtain joint residency to avoid child support. And as I stated before, I cannot afford to hire an attorney and make too much money to get a free court appointed attorney.",

    "postText": "Homes are in Maryland. We're in conjoined condos, our bathroom is above the neighbor's office.\n\nOwner and tenant of our house are both deaf, this same neighbor has been hitting us with complaints claiming that the tenant is making noise on purpose to piss her off and get back at her (for no reason given) and making complaints to our HOA. Our HOA manager told us the neighbor did this without acknowledging the owner and tenant are deaf. They do not share our HOA. \n\nThe reason I wanted advice is because given the track record, I want to verify if the bill is supposed to be split or fall solely on one of us before we have a contractor come look, but we need to sort this asap. The HOA also has a plumbing contractor on hand, and I want to see whether it's advisable that we get a second opinion. \n\nThank you ahead of time.",

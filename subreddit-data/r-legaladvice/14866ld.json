    "postText": "Hello, I am currently panicking right now because I just got a Vacate notice for non payment of rent. But when I checked on the apartment website to pay rent, I had paid everything in full. \n\nThe Vacate notice itself says that their property does not offer a process to appeal this notice?\n\nI did message the front office and they haven\u2019t contacted me back yet. \n\nI live in the state of Texas but I moved from a California to be here with family. I don\u2019t know what to do. This is my first apartment alone.",

Save a screenshot of the website saying you paid on full and make sure you have proof from your bank that you\u2019re up to date on rent\u2026.go back 3-4 months.  Print bank statements.  Better to be over prepared.  I would go in person and demand something in writing that the vacate notice is null and void.",

If you've never been late before or had no other lease violation issues, a one-time late payment should not be enough to terminate your lease over.",

She didn\u2019t read it or anything just brought it inside and stayed for the weekend. I didn\u2019t even know it existed until today. The time of the transaction of rent for this month was made in Poland, would that change things? If payment processing takes longer due to being out in the country or something? I looked through my emails and I didn\u2019t receive a warning notification or anything about it. Just a piece of paper with my apartment managers signature on it.",

But talk to them tomorrow.\n\nIt may take some extra time from out of country depending on what payment system was used.  I'd think most of them would be pretty quick even from another country.",

I wanted to comment because it seems you may be a little confused about how eviction works and I wanted to lay it out for you.\n\nThe landlord doesn't have the ability to kick you out on their own, even if they \"don't offer a process to appeal this notice\". It works like this. They give you a notice to vacate and then a few days later if their grievances aren't resolved and you haven't vacated they file for eviction with a court. The court then has a hearing where you can present evidence that you paid, such as screenshots of the website. If the judge determines that it's more likely than not that you haven't paid they issue a \"writ of possession\". They take this to the local constable, sheriff, etc and have them physically remove you from the property.\n\nSo like I mentioned above step one is to try and talk it out with the landlord. Mistakes happen, maybe they mixed the addresses up, maybe their system is being wonky, who knows.\n\nIf for whatever reason the landlord doesn't budge then step two is to gather as much evidence as possible that you paid rent and bring it to the eviction hearing. This can include bank statements, screen caps of their website, ect. Anything the shows that you made payments. For bonus points make 3 copies of each so you can give one to the landlord and one to the judge at trial and the judge will love you for it.",

    "postText": "I have a roommate and we're about to move out in a 2 days. I just found out a day or so ago that she was late to pay our rent (I send her my half the rent and then she pays online), and nows there's a late fee, which I'm not going to pay because it should've never been late. she claims her bank account got messed up. her and the apartment manager agreed that she pay a certain amount on Wednesday (our move out date) and the rest be paid from our security deposit.\n\nI never agreed to have my security deposit be put towards the rent. I already sent her my half of the rent, and if she's taking my half of the security to put towards it, then she owes me my half. she also needs to pay her half of the entergy bill ($62). my half fo the security deposit is $150, so she's going to own me $212. \n\nhow can I go about to make sure she pays me my $212? I was thinking about writing a contract and having her sign it. but if she doesn't pay by time the contract entales, I take her to court, right? is it worth going to court over this?",

            "comment": "That's small claims territory if you want to pursue it. It is also small beer. Filing charges are generally cheap depending on your jurisdiction but you would also need to take time off work to appear before the court, get there somehow and then wait for the ruling. Once you've done all of that chasing, this will probably have cost you more than $212.\n\nBasically it's quite a lot of fuss over a very small amount of money. \n\nNone of which stops you from asking for the money and saying you'll take her to small claims if she doesn't pay up. If she says no, then you have the option of giving it up as a waste of time or calling her bluff and filing in small claims.",

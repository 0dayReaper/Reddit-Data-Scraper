    "postText": "He died a couple months ago, her step mom has been in the hospital unable to probate his estate. We talked to their attorney and she said \"he didn't have much, don't worry about it, he didn't leave you anything\". We don't know if there is a will or not, but her dad and her had a very close relationship and a lot of money in stocks and some other things. It seems like her step mom and possibly step sister are trying to take everything.   \nI haven't been able to look too much into it yet, but one lawyer we spoke to charged $400/hr and said it could take 5-8 months.. She will be paying lawyer fees based on return from the estate received and that sounds like it could drain every dollar before she gets it.  \nWe assume his estate is worth between 100k-300k  \nShe has one biological sister, and a living stepmom (who is bed ridden).  \nThey seem to have an attorney who is being purposely vague, but is also not a probate attorney.  \nWhat I'm asking is  \nFlat rate vs hourly rates? How many hours would be put into a case lasting that long?  \nThings we need to ask lawyers?  \nThings we can look up on our own to make the process easier?  \nWe are very overwhelmed right now so any advice would be great.",

            "comment": "&gt;...seems like stepmom is trying to shut her out of inheritance\n\nWhat inheritance are you referring to?\n\nYour gf doesn't know if he had a will and attorney says she wasn't left anything.\n\nProbate is a court supervised process. If dad left anything to your gf as opposed to his bed-ridden wife, your gf is legally required to be notified.\n\nWills are filed with the probate court. She can go get a copy as soon as it's filed with the court.\n\nEven if there isn't a will, your gf can get info from the probate court.\n\n&gt;They seem to have an attorney who is being purposely vague\n\nAs is their right if your gf wasn't left anything in a will. They don't have to tell her anything.\n\nIf there was no will, spouse gets the entire estate.\n\nSometimes there are assets that do not become part of the estate such as life insurance policies and retirement plans with a named beneficiary. Those pass directly to the named beneficiary. Again, if this applies to your gf, she will be informed.\n\nI'm unclear on why your gf thinks she needs representation at this particular point in time. What would she be hiring the lawyer to do?",

It may be locked in one of his safes.  \n\n\nWhy wouldn't they tell her anything though? If she legally has no right to any of his estate, wouldn't being overly vague just bring unnecessary suspition?  \n\n\nAre you sure spouse gets the entire estate if no will? It's his 2nd wife, and the daughters are from the first.   \n\n\nI've been telling her to slow down for the same reason, representation may not be needed.. But it just seems like her family is trying to keep her from coming there for some reason (he died in TN, she's in TX). Then their lawyer she spoke was just saying \"nothing was left to you\" but wouldn't say anything about a will or anything. Again though, this is me going off the assuming the info I looked up is true.. I looked at multiple sources, that if father dies with a new wife, not everything goes to new wife, but also gets divided between his children.",

            "comment": "At this point, your girlfriend does not need to do anything.  There is nothing that an attorney could do for her that would benefit her.\n\nWhat she can do is to check the website of the county courthouse probate court on a weekly basis to do a case search to see if anyone ever opens up an estate proceeding for her father.\n\nOn the one hand, there may be no need to probate if there are no assets to be probated.\n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable to expect that he might have left a will that named your girlfriend as one of the beneficiaries, but if that was true, it's a mystery why the attorney and stepmother are being vague about it.\n\nIf and when a probate case is ever opened, whether with the will or without the will, then the executor or the personal representative is required to send your girlfriend a copy of the will (if she is named as a beneficiary).  Additionally, the executor or PR is legally required to list contact information for all of the family members, including your girlfriend and her biological sister, who are legally considered to be potential heirs.  That's assuming that the executor or PR knows your girlfriend's name, address and phone number.\n\nAll she can do is to wait and see if they decide to ever open up probate.\n\nIn the meantime, look at the website for the county recorder of deeds (also sometimes called the county register of deeds) to look up the address of the property where father lived, to look at the history of documents that might show who actually owns the property (is it in his name only or is his spouse's name also listed as joint co-owner).\n\nShe can ask attorney \"If they are deliberately withholding the will, do I have the option of hiring a probate attorney to get probate open so that my attorney can ask the judge to ask whoever has the will to produce it for the court?\"",

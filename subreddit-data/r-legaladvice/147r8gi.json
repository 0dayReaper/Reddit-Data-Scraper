    "postText": "Preface: So I made a post six months ago about a crazy woman getting a protective order on me all because she didn't want to pay for the custom wedding dress she ordered. Once those papers were served, I made it a habit to just completely erase her from my mind. The only reason why it got granted because I went to a Halloween party invited by the bartenders and it just happened to be the place she worked at. Judge wouldn't let me explain and granted it.   \n\n\nNow: The PO expires next Monday. I have religiously made it a habit to only go to town only for groceries and the ocassional hangout with friends. I made sure to check the places I went to make sure I didn't see her. (I don't want her trying to use the bullshit excuse to try to get it extended)\n\nHow will I know if she tries to get it extended? Can she file a new one after it has expired? If she tried to extend it, is it possible to hire a lawyer to represent me so I don't have to go to the courthouse? I absolutely do not want to see her. (which is like the opposite of what this PO is. She's \"scared for her life\" that I will do something and I literally told the judge I don't want to be around her or even think about her)\n\nI would just like to know my options. These past 6 months have been hell and I just want it to be over.",

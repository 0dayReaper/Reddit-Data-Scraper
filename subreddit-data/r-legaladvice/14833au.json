    "postText": "I see the Fair Housing Act from 1988 says \u201cfamilial status\u201d is protected, generally meaning you can\u2019t discriminate against families with children under 18. does this extend to childless couples? I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re legally married or unmarried, we aren\u2019t wishing to rent to any couples at all\n\nif a family with a child asks to rent, can we deny them not because they have a child, but because we don\u2019t want to rent to any couples? genuinely, not trying to discriminate against children and yes I feel like a complete asshole for asking these questions \n\nI have rented the entire place and am subleasing out bedrooms. look, I don\u2019t want to tell anyone no. and I don\u2019t want to discriminate or do anything illegal. but having a couple move in would mean 4 people are sharing a small bathroom instead of 3. and 5 people total would be living here using a single fridge. we simply haven\u2019t ever considered having more than 4 people in our small home to be a good idea \n\nadvice?",

You can simply turn down couples or families with children.   But you cannot advertise \"childless singles only\".\n\nUtah's fair housing law ([Utah Code section 57-21-3](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title57/Chapter21/57-21-S3.html)) mirrors the FHA exemption, and has an obvious pro-Mormon clause too.",

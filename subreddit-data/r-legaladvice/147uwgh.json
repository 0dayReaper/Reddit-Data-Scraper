    "postText": "My mother (mid 70s) had a covered patio installed that was very poorly done. She hired an attorney who, after a couple meetings, gave her money back and said he wasn\u2019t needed as it was a very simple, clear case and advised she represent herself to save the money. She started the process. \n\nThe patio company\u2019s attorney contacted her and asked if they could send out an inspector that they hired to inspect the structure before the court date. She agreed, then told me. \n\nIs there any reason she should not let their inspector come? How would this best be navigated? \n\nIf it matters: the patio has numerous significant leaks, water pours through the fans when you switch them on, the roof is slanted down towards the roof of her house so it pools there and collects inside the patio roof, etc. \n\nTy very much for any guidance you can offer. I truly appreciate your time.",

In this case I guess mom goes forward with allowing the inspection, and then goes back to her attorney or a different attorney if this company seems ready to fight rather than settle after the inspection.",

She is having them out to do their inspection and will check in with her preferred attorney again to see if he would like to work with her on this matter. His opinion seemed to be that it was a clear case of a company taking advantage of an older individual and it wont be much of a fight. Luckily she has very thorough documentation from day 1. We\u2019ll see how it goes. \n\nThank you again for your time. It succeeded in easing our stress is a very intimidating situation.",

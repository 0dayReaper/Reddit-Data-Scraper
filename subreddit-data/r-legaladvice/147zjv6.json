    "postText": "What legal risks are there in taking FMLA while on a PIP?\n\nI was recently put on a PIP at work due to \u2018behavioral\u2019 factors that really just relate to a misalignment in culture between myself and the organization. I\u2019ve always been successful in previous jobs so this has come as quite a shock. \n\nI have no intention of staying with this organization, and I am actively on the job search. Since being put on the PIP, I have received no negative feedback and have that documented in writing. \n\nThat said, I suffer from an anxiety disorder, and it\u2019s becoming really unmanageable under these circumstances. The stress levels are triggering panic attacks. My workplace is aware that I\u2019m a protected class with a disability. \n\nI consulted informally with an employment lawyer today and they suggested taking one or two months off to recover from all the anxiety (to the degree that\u2019s possible) and secondarily, focus on the job hunt, and maybe to a small degree protect myself coming out of FMLA if I haven\u2019t yet found a job (lay possibility for retaliation claim, if necessary). I need to talk to my doctor to confirm, but I believe I would qualify for paid FMLA in my state based on my mental history illness and increased frequency of treatment. \n\nI expect they will fire me, regardless, at some point during the PIP if I don\u2019t find a job first. And at least under paid FMLA I\u2019ll have health insurance (vs on unemployment) and buy myself some time\u2026 \n\nAnything I should be considering if I go this route? Any legal risks I\u2019m not understanding?",

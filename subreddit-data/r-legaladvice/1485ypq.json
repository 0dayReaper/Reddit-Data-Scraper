I don't like doing it and I don't really see any point in it so I don't usually do it. Just wondering if anyone knows why I should/shouldn't do so. I've been told that I can just use I by my boss, but she this writer now so IDK. Thanks.",

Every industry has its own stylistic quirks.  E.g. A cop testifying in court will say \"the female exited the vehicle at 0900 hours\" rather than \"the woman got out of the car at 9am.\" These mean the same thing and both have the same legal effect,but presumably some people think the former sounds more authoritative and formal.",

It\u2019s academia, science, etc. When you make written statements in the first person, these statements come out as weak, opinionated, informal and unsubstantiated by evidence. Basically, it just looks some joe shmo had an opinion to share. Not a good look. Additionally, there is an element of detachment and neutrality which places you at somewhat of a distance from the statement. You can write that \u201cpatient\u2019s reaction to medication was observed by the staff for the full hour until he appeared to no longer exhibit signs of life\u201d. Or, you can state the same with \u201cI personally sat there watching the patient until he expired\u201d. Care to guess which version will have the patient\u2019s family chasing after you with pitchforks?",

I'm just wondering if there's any legal reasons why they would want us not to use \"I\". I've been told it's because if there's a lawsuit or it needs to get turned over to the county/state then they don't like it or something. IDK I just don't see their point. I'm interested in the law so I know a little bit(not that much but more than some random person) and I don't see any benefits.",

Where using \"this author\" or \"staff\" is objective and leaves no room for interpretation. The court will still try to pick apart everything else  you write, so why make it easier on them?\nSecondly, it helps keep documentation uniform. If every other staff member is documenting this way and you are not what you document will carry less weight and will probably be used by the other side.\nLastly, there is no way to use I/me/my without sounding self-centered and biased.\n Exp: The patient took my pen, I instructed the patient to give it back to me, but he wouldn't\"\nVs: The patient took the pen this author was using. This author instructed patient to return the pen. Patient refused.",

Though the people are committed by the state usually so it's used in like commitment hearings and stuff.\nEdit:\nBasically just have they been having mental health issues or if they try running away or are acting aggressive. Most of the clients are involuntary and under a commitment order and have schizophrenia or something similar.",

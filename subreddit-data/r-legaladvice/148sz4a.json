    "postText": "Little backstory, I live in Arizona and took a job doing OSHA approved medical response for a company that has contracts with businesses in the area. Basically they call us if an employee gets injured and we go to the scene and treat the injury following OSHA guidelines. Now for the problem. When hired, I read the employee handbook very thoroughly and it stated very clearly that if we are required by the company to use our personal vehicles for these reaponses, we would be reimbursed mileage. I confirmed prior to signing the offer letter that we would be required to use our company vehicles for these responses. However, after working there for several weeks I contacted the manager and asked about the reimbursement and was told they don't do that. She then sent me a passage that she claimed was in the handbook stating as such, however the passage is not in the copy of the handbook that I and every other coworker signed,  and directly contradicts what our copy of the handbook states. I understand that a company can update a handbook but I thought they had to inform us of those changes. I feel like they purposefully sent us false information to get us to agree to work there, and are now bleeding us dry as they have us driving 200-500 miles a day. Is there any legal ramifications or are they just allowed to do whatever they want to trick us into agreeing to work there?",

They lost out common policies and procedures and helpful if they need to terminate you or avoid paying out pto. \n\nAz like most states do not require them to pay mileage. You can attempt to sue in small claims for whatever you believed you were supposed to be reimbursed under the impression you would.",

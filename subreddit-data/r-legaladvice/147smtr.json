After some thinking I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want it and I\u2019ve found a name better suited. My oath ceremony is this week, am I able to ask them to change the name I requested to be changed?",

I\u2019m assuming this naturalization ceremony is taking place at a court since otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been able to make any name change.\n\nThe web site visajourney.com might have more insight into this.",

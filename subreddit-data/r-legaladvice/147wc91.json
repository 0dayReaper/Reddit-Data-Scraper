    "postText": "So I switched car insurance carriers through the Jerry App which gets quotes from multiple car insurance companies. Went from AAA to MAPFRE, the problem is the Jerry app was supposed to cancel my previous insurance policy which had a month left on it, but now I got a collections notice from a third party company trying to charge me $211 for not paying the policy off because they\u2019re saying I never cancelled it. What should I do or what can I do? \nThe people at Jerry said they cancelled it in July of 2022 and they can send AAA the notification again which I told them to do, but the past due collections has impacted my credit report and is still on there.",

    "postText": "Last night, after getting gas, I hit the cement curb/divider that surrounds the gas pumps. I hit it hard enough that my car got stuck on it, and the gas station attendant came out and helped me get my car unstuck. The guy made me aware that moving my car was going to \"scratch the hell\" out of the bottom of my passenger side doors, which it did. But I moved the car anyway, and I thanked the guy and drove away.\n\nThis morning, on the way to work, I noticed that my little misadventure had damaged the curb/cement divider at the gas station. It has a little metal plate covering it (perhaps from all of the previous drivers that have run into it) that is now crumpled and dented. I never even considered if I could have damaged the curb when I had this accident last night. (Aren't curbs indestructable?) Should I go back and give the gas station my contact info today so I can pay for the damages? I'm kind of afraid that they might call the cops and report a hit-and-run since I didn't do this already. The gas station attendant didn't say anything to me at the time of the accident, but I might have driven away while he was still evaluating the situation. (Or he was still shaking his head at the dumbass who got his car stuck on a concrete barrier.) \n\nAlso, if they did report a hit-and-run to the police, how would I know? I live in PA but I work in Ohio, where this accident was. Would they just contact PA's DMV and mail something to me at my home address? Would they contact my insurance company? Am I going to get pulled over someday because I have been unknowingly avoiding a court summons? Any insight would be very much appreciated!",

    "postText": "My neighbor ordered a mattress from Mattress Firm, who use a 3rd party company to deliver their beds. Upon delivery, my neighbor witnessed the 3rd party company scratch his truck and my car with a metal dolly while trying to roll the mattress between the two closely parked cars. My neighbor witnessed the scratch as it happened, his wife has a video recording of it happening, and the delivery guy acknowledged the act. I only found out from my neighbor later that night. \n\nHow do I go about moving forward? I am assuming they should be responsible for covering the damages. My car is a 2022, two years in to a three year lease. If my insurance is involved in any way, am I responsible for deductibles? I'm not sure how to move forward. I currently have the video of the incident, pictures of the damage, and the number and address to the Mattress Firm. Im trying to get an understanding of my financial responsibility in this situation, if any, before moving forward so that Im not taken advantage of. ",

If they don't, then you could look at your legal options if the cost of the damages is high enough to warrant it.\n\nMake sure you gather as much evidence as possible and document any and all interactions you have with your insurance company and this delivery company.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to save my PTO for a coming vacation in October, I had a sick day recently, (stomach flu), and just didn\u2019t clock any hours for that day.\nMy manager then texted me outside of work hours to have me change it to PTO and wanted me to use a full day of PTO rather than just taking no pay.\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense to me because our state doesn\u2019t require sick leave, and why would he make me use my PTO.\nI\u2019m wondering if I actually do have to follow this, as I can\u2019t find anything saying that they can or cannot make me use my PTO for sick days in our state (Alaska)",

Employers can require this. \n\nA common stated reason for this is companies often plan production and staffing levels around worked time and PTO, and a lot of unpaid time off in addition to PTO can ruin those plans.",

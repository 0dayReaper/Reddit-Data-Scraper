    "postText": "I'm at a loss and am hoping you clever Redditors might be able to lead me in the right direction. For initial context, I live in CO, USA, and I am a 32 year-old male. I have TMJ (temporomandibular joint) dysfunction (according to this specialist) that has led to jaw clenching, and the jaw clenching is likely the cause of my 2-year long tinnitus. I had been to PT, seen my GP, ENT, and dentist about this, and finally my dentist referred me to a TMJ specialist. The specialist suggested I get a mouth appliance called an \"anterior repositioning splint\". I was initially told that I would need to wear it for 6 months, then wean off of it across 2 months.\n\nDuring the initial consult, I was told the price would be just over $3000, and was not told of any additional costs, so I assumed (I know...) that the pricing structure was like Invisalign and the price was all-inclusive. I found out after the first of many monthly visits that I had to pay between $145 and $335 for every follow-up visit. I argued that none of that was explained to me in the initial consult, but the specialist dismissed my complaint saying, \"If that was all we charged, I wouldn't make any money.\" Since I had already paid the big chunk for the appliance, I figured I was stuck and just paid. In total, I've paid over $3000 for the follow-up visits at this point.\n\nAt month 5, I mentioned to the specialist that I had 0% improvement, and he had initially said that I would be nearing the end by that time. He claimed that he never said that and dismissed the issue saying that \"sometimes it takes longer; it is different for everybody.\"\n\nAt month 12, still with 0% improvement, I told him that I wanted to stop treatment because I had already worn the appliance for twice the time he initially stated and had zero improvement. He proceeded to make me feel guilty for my decision for the rest of the appointment, even telling his receptionist at one point, \"CO\\_Throwaway2023 is very unhappy with our service.\"\n\nI understand that it is ridiculous to consider legal action against a medical professional just because a treatment didn't work, but this whole situation feels like so much more than just \"treatment didn't work\". I'm upset that the treatment didn't work, yes, but based on my complete lack of improvement, I can't help but wonder if it was just a misdiagnosis, whether intentional or not, right from the beginning. In addition, his behavior has been manipulative all the way through; I feel like he's been gaslighting me. I had a friend suggest that the money issue should be dealt with under the No Surprises Act, but I found that they do not deal with dental or dental-related claims.\n\nFor additional context, using this appliance has been no walk in the park. For the first couple of months, it made my clenching much worse, and caused constant head and neck aches. In addition, you are meant to wear it all day, including while eating. It was difficult to learn to eat with it, and I continued to struggle to eat for a couple of months after getting it in. It also affected my speech and made it sound like I had a speech impediment for months after starting use. In general, it was a nightmare. I've had it out now for 2 months, and my bite is still not back to normal. My molars do not touch in the back, and my front teeth touch when I bite down. Also, it's incredibly uncomfortable to try to touch my teeth together; it feels like I am straining when I try to rest my teeth against each other.\n\nSo is there anything I *should* do here? Even if so, is there anything I *can* do? Am I being overly sensitive, or is this situation something I should pursue?",

IME Dr.s will generally give the other Dr the benefit of the doubt, *but* if they think you were grossly misdiagnosed or treated really poorly - that is, outside the standard of care - I think they will tell you. To me it would be worth seeing another specialist if I felt as you do, OP.",

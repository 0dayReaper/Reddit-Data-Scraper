    "postText": "After buying a home in a community with an HOA that is still controlled by the developer, we stood up for ourselves and demanded the developer comply with our contract and rights related to an access easement on our property (there are additional details but this should be enough background to understand the situation). \n\nOver the last year we believe the developer and neighbors acting in concert have been harassing us.  (I know it sounds a little paranoid.)  individually, none of the actions are grossly outrageous but taken together it is very stressful.  Here are my questions:\n\nDoes anyone know what level of coordination I need to prove they're acting together? \n\nCan I hold the developer responsible for creating the situation even if I can't prove he's directing the harassment?\n\nCould the HOA be liable if they know about but do nothing to stop the harassment?\n\nThis is in SW United States.   Sorry to be vague but I dont feel comfortable being more specific. \n\nThanks",

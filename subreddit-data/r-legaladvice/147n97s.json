    "postText": "Hi, I'm in southern VA and I bought a user car from a dealership about a month ago.  Temp tags have expired already.  They said the title would take some time to get to me, since the title was at some other office and they don't keep the titles at the lot.  Am I eligible for a full refund?  What are the steps I need to take?",

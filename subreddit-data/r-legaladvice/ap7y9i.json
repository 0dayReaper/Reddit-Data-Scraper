    "postText": "I've been living in a foster home since January '18. I turn 15 in March. The foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. She blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. I never had sex with her, and I would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. Unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. The foster \"parent\" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.\n\nI can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. I said I would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks I will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. She is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",

If she wants to avoid a rape charge, she will probably drop this paternity nonsense.\n\nGo to the police/the DA if you must. Good luck.",

Tell them about the alcohol abuse in the home, tell them about the yelling, tell them about the manipulation and saying your the father. Be as honest and thorough as possible and disclose all of the issues with the home. If you tell them all of that and stuff still isn\u2019t being done contact your local children\u2019s advocate. They are literally there to advocate on your behalf. \n\nAs everyone else has said, it would be illegal for you to be the father because of your age so if that\u2019s the way your foster parent and her daughter want to go they are just causing trouble for themselves. This 22 year old woman is claiming to have sexually abused you and, true or not, the foster mother is failing to protect you. This should lead to an investigation into the home and (hopefully) that foster home will be shut down. Either way the daughter is claiming to have sexually abused you, you are not going to be required to stay in that home. \n\nAs far as being able to afford a lawyer and DNA testing, that is not your responsibility. You are a minor who is in the care of the state. If it gets to that stage (which I seriously doubt it will once the foster family realizes what a world of misery they are opening on themselves) all costs involved will be the responsibility of the state since they are your legal guardian.\n\nStop discussing the paternity with your foster family. Do not offer DNA testing, do not sign anything, do not engage in any discussion at all. When your foster mother brings it up tell her you are not talking about it and to talk to your caseworker. If she brings you to a doctor or for DNA testing tell the doctor you want your caseworker present. She is digging her own grave. Your caseworker or lawyer may later ask you to do a DNA test to prove it is not your child, but that is something that should be done with them, not with your foster parent. As already said multiple times, there are much larger legal implications in what is going on here and you really need to get CPS involved.",

Tell her to leave you alone. If she wants to claim you are the father she can file for custody and support. You'll go to court and request a paternity test. They will see you are not the father and everyone will move on with their lives. You won't need a lawyer and you shouldn't pay her a single cent. ",

Also I personally would adamantly deny it every single time it\u2019s brought up and tell her if you\u2019re put on the birth certificate that you will be calling the police and reporting a potential statutory rape and assault since apparently she slept with you while you were passed out and unable to consent plus minors can\u2019t consent anyway.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGet out of there any way you can OP. It will only get worse. Even if you have to go to a shelter. ",

    "postText": "I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. \n\n\nMy sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. \n\n\nI phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible. \n\n\nLocation: New Jersey, USA\n \n\nEdit: Thank you for all your assistance. I have contacted a lawyer who has represented my interests in the past and have been advised to not speak further until paperwork can be filed with the necessary courts. Thank you for your time and support in this time. ",

Keep records of very interaction your or your grandson have with the mother. You can order birth certificates online in a lot of counties and they will mail them to you. With the birth certificate and any paperwork from CPS you can then get his social security card locally. Get him in school and counseling ASAP this will look good for the both of you if you want to stay together. Have an open door policy with CPS Incase the mom tried to pull punches. And most importantly give your grandson lots of love hugs and patience! The reddit universe is rooting for you! With love to you and yours......Good Luck!",

So unless OP is a registered sex offender or has previously lost parental rights under dependency or has otherwise done something horrible we don\u2019t know about, it\u2019s almost guaranteed the minor will remain with OP as an actual placement. \n\nIn my state, absent an arrangement between the grandparents and parent that doesn\u2019t have CPS involvement, CPS would probably bring a case for neglect based on a \u201cno provision for support\u201d theory. Kid would be declared a dependent minor and services would either be offered to reunify the kid and parents, or there\u2019d be a negotiated settlement bypassing the court processes and a court-approved legal guardianship. \n\nAs a procedural wrinkle here, given the kids moms residency and the location of the kid, I think nominally the NJ court would hear the petition then kick it to moms home state for hearing, but it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve done UCCJEA stuff",

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

What do I do?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n&gt; I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

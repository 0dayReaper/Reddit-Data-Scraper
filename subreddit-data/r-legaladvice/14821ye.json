    "postText": "Hey so I'm a stay at home mom 33 and my husband is 41 and just recently had to get a second job just to cover our bills. And so I've been trying to earn money any way I can and so I've been using of those online things and they do payout. But this one offers you cash back if you buy let's say 2 things of tide pods then you'll get like $12 added to your account. So my thought was to do literally every single one that is available and scan the receipts, make sure it's all sent in correctly, then just return all the items cuz I don't need them or want to spend the money even. But I'm not sure if that's illegal or not, and if so then how would anyone know that's what I'm actually doing. And you can only do each item twice a month so that's not very often and with a receipt then Walmart doesn't track how many your doing and won't limit you. So yeah, what do you guys think?",

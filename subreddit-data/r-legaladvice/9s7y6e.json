    "postText": "I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. \nFlash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I\u2019m obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there\u2019s any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there\u2019s so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would\u2019ve payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you. \n \nEdit: My location is in San Bernardino County SoCal",

That was a recent SC case, Rodriguez v. United States.  ",

I'm gonna guess that the officer asked for consent a second time (likely to wait for the dog) and OP gave it to him. Or, there are other pieces missing that gave the officer probable cause (maybe OP didn't have the car registered or something like that). Obviously I could be wrong but I imagine any half competent law enforcement officer knows that you can't detain someone without probable cause.",

They are NOT allowed to prolong a stop to wait for a drug dog.  The standard for whether the police are liable hinges on whether or not they were reasonable in the level of damage they did to your property.  If the entire search was obviously illegal, that certainly makes their destruction less reasonable.  \n\nThere's no magic trick here.  Contact whoever they told you to, and/or the police station to get routed to the right person.  Tell them what it will cost to repair.   They will look into it and get back to you with an offer.  You can accept it, or take it to court.  ",

That\u2019s enough time to conduct a records inquiry, reg check, and write a ticket (honestly 10 minutes is more than enough if the radio is clear, maybe 30 if your a day one trainee).\n\nBasically if I don\u2019t get consent, searchable probation/parole, or develop Probable Cause for a search I can only detain you long enough to write my ticket.\n\nIf I suspect your DUI I can detain long enough to wait for backup and do FST\u2019s.\n\nAbsent any of that, it\u2019s what is reasonable...the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t make hard rules they often fall back on what is reasonable because law enforcement is dynamic and there isn\u2019t one best blanket scenario. And the word reasonable is what is reasonable to an officer with similar training and experience not a regular joe. \n\nYa don\u2019t just drive away though. Highly discourage that. And if you think a cop is violating your rights (4th amendment usually though we do occasionally violate the 5th, 6th and 1st) just go along so long as it\u2019s reasonable. You\u2019ll get a nice pay day and that cop will be rightfully disciplined. \n\nFor an easier to digest debrief on the Rodriguez case try this link\n\nhttp://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Rodriguez_F15.pdf",

            "comment": "That search may have been illegal. The principal underlying the usage of drug dogs is that people have no interest in the privacy of contraband. Because drug dogs are trained to only detect contraband, cause to search is derived from the fact that a reliable source has determined that you are in possession of contraband. Because recreational MJ is legal in CA, any drug dogs trained to smell MJ should have their results called into question, because the sniff would cause a false positive for a legal substance. That would violate your right against unreasonable search and seizure. However, it is also possible that this dog was a recently trained drug dog that was not taught to sniff for MJ.I think that contacting the county is a good first step. It's worth consulting with a local lawyer as well.  \n\n\nEdit: I don't know if this case has been decided in CA because legalization is so recent, but CO decided the case last year: [https://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Court\\_of\\_Appeals/Opinion/2017/16CA0050-PD.pdf](https://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Court_of_Appeals/Opinion/2017/16CA0050-PD.pdf)  \n\n\nIn relevant part:  For while possession of marijuana by anyone in any amount remains a crime under federal law, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2012), this is no longer the case under state law. Because Amendment 64 legalized possession for personal use of one ounce or less of marijuana by persons twenty one years of age or older in Colorado, it is no longer accurate to say, at least as a matter of state law, that an alert by a dog which can detect marijuana (but not specific amounts) can reveal only the presence of \u201ccontraband.\u201d3 A dog sniff could result in an alert with respect to something for which, under Colorado law, a person has a legitimate expectation of privacy, i.e., the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use.   Because a dog sniff of a vehicle could infringe upon a legitimate expectation of privacy solely under state law, that dog sniff should now be considered a \u201csearch\u201d for purposes of article II section 7 of the state constitution where the occupants are twenty-one years or older.

I've only heard of their use to assist in executing a search warrant, but I can foresee a case where an electronics dog sniff would be suppressed under that case. \n\nI could also see the Co. Supremes flipping that case on the other side of the amount argument, that dogs can't sniff weight, and thus police can search for the total weight of the marijuana. I doubt they will, but it's not an impossible leap from that opinion. \n\nThanks for contributing. ",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. \n&gt; Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I\u2019m obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there\u2019s any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there\u2019s so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would\u2019ve payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

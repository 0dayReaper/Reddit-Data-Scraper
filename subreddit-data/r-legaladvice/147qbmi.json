    "postText": "My sister's boyfriend took her leased car (that was uninsured), crashed it, and fled the scene. There was someone else in the vehicle (a woman) and as of now no one has confirmed whether or not this woman was my sister. Either way, my sister's car was totaled and she's an idiot for not having car insurance.  \nHer husband (yup) had recently took her vehicle off his insurance but left her name on it so that she was insured if she ever needed to drive his car. They are still legally married but separated.  \nShe never tells her husband about the accident; he finds out. The same month her husband receives a letter from his insurance outlining the details of a claim; the claim alleges that a vehicle NOT listed on his policy caused property damage and bodily injury. That's right, my sister's boyfriend crashed her car into another drive (John Doe) , and fled the scene. When my sister's husband confronts her about it she said that she was in the car; she told our younger sibling that she was not in the car.  \nNaturally, my sister's husband tells his insurance exactly who was driving his wife's car, her boyfriend. They deny John Does claim and now her husband is in the process of removing his wife's name from his insurance. Her husband receives another letter; this time it's from John Doe's insurance, and it's addressed to my sister. He immediately gave her the letter and then called me panicking: three months later.  \nThis all happened three months ago in IL and instead of turning her boyfriend in to the police or addressing her \"no-insurance\" dilemma, she leased a new car only this time with insurance. Meanwhile, John Doe (the driver or policy holder that is in their 80's) has been trying to reach her.  \nThe only reason why I know any of this is because I'm getting married soon and so I called my sister to invite her to be a bridesmaid at my wedding. Inviting her to my wedding was a big deal because after a few fights caused by her constant lying and semi-erratic behavior we decided to stop talking to each other. I \"never got around\" to asking her to be my bridesmaid but she did ask me one hilarious question:  \n\"How much legal trouble are my boyfriend and I in?\"  \nI'd love to answer her, but I don't even know where to begin. I went from wanting my sister to attend my wedding to desperately wanting to attend her offensively stupid boyfriend's inevitable arraignment. This was a lot, thanks for reading.",

The only way to find out is for you and/or your boyfriend to talk to your own attorney.\u201d\n\nYou, yourself, can decide if you are willing to talk to any insurance representatives, process servers, bill collectors or police who hit you up for information.",

I have all of his information and I'm not opposed to trying to get his blood type for them too. He needs to go to jail but it sounds like unless his name gets added directly to that police report (not just with the insurance people) that they will let that go. I'm hoping that's not the case...",

I also left a number they could use to contact me (not my actual number because I don't want my sister or her bfs lawyer to see that). I don't think his lawyer knows about his new hit and run so this will be an ugly surprise at his first hearing for a different incident (same scenario, motor vehicle causing injury).",

            "comment": "Whose name is the lease in?  Sister's?  Husband?  Both?\n\nAssuming it was in the sister's name and that husband had nothing to do with the lease, the sister is liable to the lease company.   The sister and the boyfriend are both liable to the person who they hit.  The boyfriend committed two crimes (hit and run and driving without insurance) and can be criminally charged.  Depending on what your sister did to help the boyfriend, she might be chargeable as an accessory.   More likely, though, is that she gets sued either (a) by the original leasing company, and/or (b) by the victim or his insurance company.  (The victim can also sue the boyfriend.) \n\nIn John Doe's shoes, I'd file a police report.   However, depending on where you are, there's a decent chance that the cops won't do anything about it.",

                    "comment": "The lease was in my sisters name and I don't think she is responding to John Doe's insurance because she's may be aware of how screwed she is considering she didn't have insurance on her car. I've been wondering about whether she's getting herself into more trouble by not turning her boyfriend in (like you said, it sounds like at a certain point she is risking being charged as a possible accessory). In IL it is mandatory to have insurance on all vehicles so I imagine at the VERY least she's looking at getting fined and having her license suspended by the IL SOS. \n\nAs for the boyfriend...I really hope they do something and arrest him because this is apparently not the first time he's done this in another persons' vehicle (remember he has no license). I would imagine that John Doe filed a police report considering that his dumb ass ran from the scene (there are rumors that he may have been drunk as well).  This all happened in IL...is there a way I could call and give an anonymous tip to the police? It really disgusts me that this isn't the first time he's gotten into an accident causing injury (but also makes sense why he ran now)",

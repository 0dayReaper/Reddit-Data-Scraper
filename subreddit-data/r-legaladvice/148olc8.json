    "postText": "My husband was in an accident a while back. A woman pulled out onto incoming traffic and break checked my husband. Once they both got out of their car the woman admitted fault and apologized for breaking and not looking/ signaling where she was going. Once the cop and the womans husband came the woman changed her story saying it was all my husbands fault. After my husband told the cop she admitted the cop asked and she confessed she did say that. \nJust now getting back the report and the cop listed my husband at fault even tho at the scene he said it was both at fault because of her admitting it. Why did the cop change his story?",

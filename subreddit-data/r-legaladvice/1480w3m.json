    "postText": "\nI was recently in an accident ( not at fault) in NJ.\n\nMy car insurance handled my claim, and my PIP paid medical primary and health paid secondary.\n\nI recently received a letter from Health Subro saying if I take a settlement to make sure to account for damages to repay health or my health plan could be compromised.\n\nMy car insurance company has also sent me a \u201c Release of Property Liability\u201d so they can settle within the 3rd parties property liability of $5k. The thing is my health would be owed $10k. I feel like I can\u2019t legally sign this for my car company because it would compromise my health plan.\n\nAny advice?",

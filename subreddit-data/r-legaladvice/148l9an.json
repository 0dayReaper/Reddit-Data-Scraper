    "postText": "Hi everybody I have really fucked up I think. Today I was dropping someone to the train station and I failed to yield at traffic circle. And just my luck it was a cop.  So few streets away I pulled over and he told me I was in violation of not yielding and using my phone for google\nMaps(I am in NJ). He didn\u2019t issue me a ticket/summon right there and I don\u2019t remember if he said if he\u2019d mail(or give me one) one or not, but he gave all my documents back. He also asked about previous incidents and I hesitated told him about an accident I had a week before where I rear ended someone(have not gotten a ticket, only a police report which I did not pay to see). Then he just old me to drive safe. I\u2019m not sure what the next steps are and what to expect. Any help appreciated. Thanks.",

In order to do that they want to use our owned home as the address and say were room mates. Is this legal? Would we get into any issues in time? They are friends we trust wouldn't screw us over so theirs no concerns really.",

But they need to register where they live, where the cars will be kept. Not doing so causes all sorts of issues potentially, including potential insurance fraud and/or not being covered in the event of an accident.",

I have never heard of that being prosecuted as a crime or civil violation.\n\nIn practice, just dealing with their WSDOL-related mail is not a particularly big hassle.\n\n&gt;we trust wouldn't screw us over\n\nUntil they've got nowhere to live and come park their RV on your lawn and claim they are tenants, backed up with their evidence that they register vehicles and drivers licenses at your address.   If you don't think that's a risk, go ahead.",

    "postText": "Ok I really need some advice. I bought a 2007 GMC Sierra last July, with only 80k mileage. I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t do my necessary diligence, but my parents had bought cars from this dealership before, had no issues, and he\u2019s got great reviews. The issue started about a month ago. I noticed a knock in the rear end, and I had a slow leak in one tire, so I took it to local mechanic, fix tire, check out knock, nbd I thought. A few days after dropping it off mechanic calls, tells me truck isn\u2019t roadworthy and I need to see what\u2019s going on. Basically rear half of the frame is just eaten away by rust, and the cab was not bolted to the frame.  He said my only recourse would be having the frame completely replaced. I called dealer not really knowing what else to do. He referred to a mechanic he knows, said 2nd mechanic will fix it up no problem. I had my doubts but slowed drove the truck the 20 miles to him. He had a few days before I went back to talk to him. 2nd mechanic had bolted the cab to the frame, so it\u2019s slightly safer now. He also said he\u2019d taken it to a body shop in town, and both agreed even a new frame was not going to fix the issue. Every bracket, rear axle, basically everything metal on the frame would need to be replaced and it would cost more than the trucks worth. 2nd mechanic also said no way the dealer didn\u2019t know about this huge problem. As I said they know each other and 2nd mech also sells auction vehicles on the side, truck was bought at auction. It had actually been moved through 3 or 4 auctions before dealer bought it. Had spent 07-21 in Tennessee, then auctioned, auctioned, auctioned, and ended up at dealership in South Dakota. 2nd mechanic told me once one of the leaf spring brackets or U bolts goes just to junk it. But I can\u2019t do that. I have a loan on it, and have 4 yrs left. I\u2019ll say this, you\u2019d nr know it has this issue looking at it. Hardly any body rust, low mileage, it looks very sharp. But 2nd mech said to me, \u201cplease don\u2019t sell this truck\u201d. I\u2019ve called dealer a few times since learning this, but he doesn\u2019t answer or return my calls. I know he knew about the problem, told me he had it aligned, it couldn\u2019t have been missed. The frame was also painted black, but idk who did that. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything I can do in this situation, legally. It was a buy as is contract, no warranty. But I really feel like I got hosed, and what the dealer did was wrong/evil. He\u2019s a small independent outfit, so I guess I understand him not wanting to take the hit on this truck. But I literally was driving a death trap for 10 months, because the cab wasn\u2019t bolted, even a small accident could\u2019ve been terrible. And now I\u2019m terrified I could be driving down the highway the rear end gives out and I, or even worse, someone else gets seriously injured. Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the length. And just for clarification, I bought the truck in South Dakota, but I live in Nebraska.",

It also has very low mileage. I don\u2019t really plan on trying to sell it, but I bet with used vehicle prices being so high, I could probably get close. Even if it took awhile to sell it\u2019d be fine, I recently got a company car. So I don\u2019t really even need it anymore.",

My own attorney/uncle said I may have a fraud or misrepresentation case, against the dealer, but it\u2019s hard to prove. He\u2019s also licensed in NE not SD, so isn\u2019t sure if their consumer protection laws. I was hoping someone in this group would have some information.

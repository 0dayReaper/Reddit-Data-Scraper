    "postText": "Just had a call from husband who said he was stationary in traffic when he was hit from behind. The shunt was so much that his face smashed into the steering wheel and he busted his lip. He said he saw her split second coming up fast behind him looking down on her phone distracted and there was nothing he could do before she hit. \nToddler seems okay but husbands head is ringing and obviously lip is busted. Worried a little about them both as if he is in pain then wondering if toddler will feel it later.\nThe car damage was minimal but bumper will need replacing. Just greatful it wasn\u2019t worse.\n\n Can he have her charged for something? Not sure what next steps are here",

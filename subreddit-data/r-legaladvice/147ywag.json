    "postText": "Our tax preparer filed our taxes, state and IRS confirmed receipt and the right money went into/out of our accounts. \n\nBut then she ghosted us. Never charged an invoice, never picks up our calls, has ignored our emails asking her to invoice us. \n\nIt feels fishy but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. She has our SSNs and one bank account, so far nothing is amiss but there\u2019s always another year. \n\nAny ideas what I should do and if I should do anything?",

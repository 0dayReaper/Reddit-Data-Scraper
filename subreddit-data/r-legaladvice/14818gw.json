    "postText": "sorry if this is in the wrong sub! I am working with getting a 1 month sublettor for the summer (which is becoming less and less worth it to me because I\u2019m getting a fraction of the rent from him and it\u2019s turning into a big hastle). He\u2019s from India and has had a lot of trouble looking for affordable housing (most leases start August and he\u2019s looking for one that starts in July), and I have a small room that I\u2019m subletting for very cheap. \n\nHowever, I requested a security deposit (because I\u2019ve read/heard that\u2019s what you should do for a sublet), and he wants to pay it when he gets to the house in cash instead of ahead of time to avoid the international wire fees. I told him I\u2019d really prefer if he paid it ahead of time, but now he said this:\n\nI won't be able to make any international payment for this quarter ( Q2 2023 ) i have exceeded the limit. Or else I have to declare the source of income and file for taxes. Since I am not a working professional there are plenty of complications involved.\n\nIs it unreasonable to ask for a security deposit? He\u2019s also brought up how I could not sign the lease until he gets to the US and pays the deposit, and that I could sue him if he tries to move in, but the fact he\u2019s brought up those measures is kind of worrying me. I\u2019m new to subletting and don\u2019t want to get into a stressful situation or get scammed, and I just feel really bad about all this. \n\nBy the way, I met him from a subletting Facebook group for my university, so I don\u2019t personally know him.",

Lots of red flags, who knows what might happen even he get there,I'd do my due dilgance on squatters rights etc. This could easily go to the next level, find a competent lawyer and do a consult for a sublet contract. It might cost a couple hundred dollars,but I bet it will save you 10x that in headaches...",

So I think I need to stop talking to this guy because it\u2019s so not worth it. I want to help him because being an international student sounds really tough, but I have spent so much time and energy on this for like nothing",

Why not just say thanks but no thanks?",

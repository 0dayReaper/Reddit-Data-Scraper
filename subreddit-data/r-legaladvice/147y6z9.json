    "postText": "I am positive the answer is no; however, I am posting to give my husband other opinions than mine. \n\nIn September 2021, we bought (financed) a 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman at a ridiculously high interest rate due to crappy credit. About a week after we took the car home, it was leaking oil so we brought it back to CarMax. The oil pan was leaking so they replaced it. About 7-8 months after that, the car really began showing signs of decreased driving performance so we took it to a Mini dealership, where they replaced spark plugs and some other things for $1,400. Still after that, it didn\u2019t feel \u201cnormal\u201d. My husband has basically been complaining about the car being \u201cbad\u201d since this time, but we haven\u2019t been able to pinpoint any other issues until now. Even then, Mini did a complete check over and we fixed what they said we should.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, his co-worker told him he saw blue smoke coming out of the tailpipe and that generally meant a bad head gasket. He opened up the hood and showed us oil bubbling into the coolant overflow tank. He said the car could last 10K more miles, or we could drive down the street and it\u2019d entirely die. We\u2019re still driving it today because we really have no choice, as my car is at Kia getting a new engine under warranty (this Thursday marks 1 month at the dealership!) I took the Mini to a small foreign repair shop the other day and the mechanic confirmed the failing head gasket, and also said the turbo was going in the engine. We can feel it struggling, but we\u2019ve done an oil change and are just hoping for the best until my car is fixed. But even then, we still need a second car. We still have A LOT left on the loan and A LOT of negative equity if we could somehow trade it in. I\u2019m not sure that we can afford to fix it, but we can\u2019t get an estimate until I get my car back and we can drop the Mini off at the dealership. \n\nI know there is really no way to get CarMax to rectify this as it\u2019s now been almost 2 years and we didn\u2019t purchase MaxCare because we really couldn\u2019t afford an even more expensive monthly payment. The Mini manufacturer warranty ran out at 50K miles (we bought it with 41K as a previous fleet car) and we have no other warranties. My husband is insisting we complain to someone about this and \u201cget them to do something\u201d but I honestly have no desire to waste my energy or time on such a process when it\u2019ll go nowhere. Do you think it\u2019s worth it to launch a formal complaint? If so, would we contact CarMax first? We really don\u2019t have a lot of \u201cproof\u201d, aside from records from that first oil pan repair and the receipt for spark plugs, or an old mechanic with a grudge against Mini\u2019s word that these Mini engines are bad and CarMax sold us a car that had been \u201cbeat to hell\u201d. I\u2019ve told my husband a thousand times now, this happens all the time with used cars, but he is very angry and we almost got into an argument today because I told him he could make the complaint himself. Ultimately, he wants CarMax to give him a replacement car. How likely is that to happen?",

You got a 7 year old car of suspect reliability.  And now you have a 9 year old car with some substantive engine problems which is sort of the nature of 9 year old cars. \n\n&gt;Ultimately, he wants CarMax to give him a replacement car. How likely is that to happen?\n\nThere is no apparent chance of that happening.  And no appearance that CarMax has done anything wrong.",

Mini's powertrain warranty is for 50,000 miles or 4 years, whichever comes first, so it had expired in 2018.\n\nCarMax offers extended service agreements;  you didn't buy one.\n\n&gt;Mini engines are bad and CarMax sold us a car that had been \u201cbeat to hell\u201d.\n\nThat's not actionable.   Even in places where it's hard to write a true as-is sale and there could conceivably be a \"implied warranty of merchantability\", you are describing a used car that has performed like a used car of that make and age.\n\nYour husband is welcome to make a complaint to CarMax, but he should not expect success.",

The issue that came up months later wasn't their responsibility, because it wasn't an issue when you bought the car. The issue two years later is even less their problem. You drove the car, and issues came up. That happens. He didn't buy a warranty, so it's not warranteed. That's unfortunate for you, but not their problem.",

    "postText": "Short version is, I paid a plumber about $350 to fix a leak under my sink. Hours after they left the sink was still leaking. They came back and after admitting (on camera!) that the original repair was incomplete, quoted me almost $800 *on top of* that $350 to fix it. I offered to let them complete the repair at their cost. They declined, so I filed a small claims suit. They offered to settle for the original $350 (plus court costs) provided I make no disparaging remarks about the plumber or their work; I couldn't talk about anything related to this issue. I declined. Some thinly veiled threats were made towards me, which I ignored.\n\nBut it's clear that they don't want word of this experience reaching public ears. I'm wondering if there's anything they can say or do to convince a judge to legally ban me from talking about this -- posting a review on Google or Yelp, for example. I understand about slander and libel but that's not what I'm talking about. Assuming the judge finds in my favor (which I am confident in) is there anything that they can say or do to convince the judge to effectively shut me up about this issue?",

    "postText": "Hello\n\nLet's say someone books a hotel room for a low budget adult film (no film crew, no heavy equipment etc). They review the list of hotel policies and confirm the lists completeness with hotel staff. The policies do not mention commercial use or videography anywhere.\n\nLet's say this guest uses the restaurant and pool for plot scenes, avoiding any hotel branding and people who have not signed a release form. These scenes are fully clothed and do not depict any illegal activities.\n\n**Could hotel management file a suit for damages if they claim the generic table pattern and background can be used to identify the hotel?**\n\n**Similarly, could they legitimately claim some in-room design features identify the hotel, and file a suit for damages stemming from misappropriation with adult content?**",

    "postText": "Good Morning Everyone, \n         I have a question about grandparental rights. So, back in 2016, my daughters mother and I split. I received full custody of my daughter, this happened while we were living in Florida for a few years at the time. My children went to stay with my ex\u2019s parents in New Hampshire for what was supposed to be a week or two while we got our living situations figured out. While my daughter was in New Hampshire, the parents went behind my back and file an emergency order in an attempt to get custody of my daughter (New Hampshire recognized grandparental rights, Florida does not). Their attempt at gaining custody failed, my daughters mother didn\u2019t even attempt to get custody, so I have sole custody, however the grandparents were granted visitation twice a year. \n      Neither party is any longer associated with the state where the order originated (New Hampshire) and the hearing should have been held in Florida originally since that\u2019s where my daughter and myself had lived for years prior to this happening, but I didn\u2019t have the resources or knowledge back then to fight it. Fast forward to now, my daughter absolutely doesn\u2019t want to go up there and see the grandparents anymore because the grandmother is just toxic and vile toward her. My question is, what does everyone think the odds are of me getting that court order overturned seeing as how it was out of jurisdiction in the first place and neither party is associated with the state the order originated in? \n       My daughter is 12 now and she turns into a nervous wreck in the weeks before she has to go. I\u2019m at a loss of what to do. I\u2019m a veteran, currently in school for my Master of Social Work, I\u2019m married with two other kids. My daughter made A/B honor roll last year and is thriving with me, she\u2019s been living with me for 7 years now. I\u2019m just looking for some input. Thanks everyone!",

Or does it just vaguely say \u201callowed visitation twice a year\u201d? If it\u2019s the second, you can tell them \u201cKid doesn\u2019t want to travel this year, but she\u2019s available these two days this year if you want to come visit with her at my house.\u201d Or suggest a virtual visit/Zoom call. There, you have done your duty allowing visitation.\n\nAnd/or, just tell them she isn\u2019t coming, sorry, and let them go ahead and try to get the order enforced. They will have to start in NH, which is an inappropriate forum since the child doesn\u2019t live there, Florida would be appropriate but doesn\u2019t recognize their rights, so, basically zero chance they\u2019re going to legally succeed or you\u2019ll face any repercussions for not sending her.",

There may be lee-way to say she's been going to you, now you need to do your part and come to her or you just won't get the visitation this year. It's a big ask to put the whole onus on you to deliver the child for visitation from states away, so the judge may not have.",

            "comment": "Other parties here are correct, you have a very specific question that you should have an attorney well versed in family law to answer, especially one who has experience in Florida and New Hampshire. I am not sure if a family court in Florida would modify or nullify an out of state order like that but they might.  \n\nIn any case, because of the complexity of interstate family court and the specificity of your question, I recommend finding an attorney.\n\nQuestion, do you have the original judicial order from New Hampshire? When you say \"visitation\", it doesn't sound like your daughter has to go up to anywhere however they have a right to visit your daughter. The wording of the order is critical to see what rights/responsibilities are here. \n\nIn addition, even where visitation is granted, sometimes virtual visitation can be adequate such as through Zoom or Teams. Finally you can file a motion with the original court can also make modifications and terminate the visitation, and they can ask your now twelve year old daughter what her wishes are if the can articulate them.",

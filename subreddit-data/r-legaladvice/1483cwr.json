    "postText": "I am an online reseller who sells on eBay and Facebook Marketplace. I recently sold someone a $395 item (a piece of vintage, new with tags clothing) the buyer then said they wanted to return it and I agreed as long as the item was returned to me in the condition they received it. They sent me a piece of their used children's clothing instead, which is essentially worthless.\n\nI reached out to Paypal before I even received the item back because I was concerned it was going to be a scam. The buyer stated they wanted a return because I had sent them the the wrong item and also that it was damaged, neither of which was true. I provided Paypal with the messages I had received from the buyer where they never said the item was damaged and they were in fact trying to buy more items off of me and got upset when I refused to sell them more of the items I had (because I felt like they weren't trustworthy) and then submitted for a refund. Paypal ruled in their favor.\n\nI filed a police report, an IC3 report as well as a mail fraud report as soon as I received the item from the buyer and provided the case numbers to Paypal. They reviewed the case and then ruled in the buyers favor as well as charged me $15 for a dispute fee because I tried to stop someone from stealing from me.\n\nI am a highly rated seller on eBay as well as Facebook with over 2000 items sold including a fair amount of high end collectibles worth more than this item, what sense would it make for me to just rip off this one random customer?? \n\nAll I wanted was my merchandise back so I could sell it and instead got a big headache. I am beyond frustrated, at times I just want to throw things! I just don't know what I can do to try to recover my property or my money.\n\nI should add that the buyer is in Florida and I am in Minnesota and that this was all done using Paypal goods and services.\n\nI'm just wondering what kind of recourse I may have or where I should start to try to find someone willing to help me not be victimized by Paypal and this crooked buyer?\n\nThank you for any help you can offer, I really appreciate it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure about legal things on firearms but I recently had to move back to my parents house. I have a firearm locked in a case that was at the previous house I was staying at. I gave birth recently and it had to be moved to my parents house, but my brother ended up taking it to his house and was showing it off to his friends instead and my parents did not seem to care. \n\nI decided it would be best to get rid of the gun and take it to a pawn shop to get some money from the sale but did not realize it had been with my brother the whole time(2 weeks). He has a history with the law and I did not feel comfortable with him having it so I had been bugging my parents (who again, did nothing to actually help get it back)about asking for it back. I finally get the gun case back and the magazine  is not in there. I cannot sell the gun without the magazine. \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering how to go about this. Should I report it stolen and/or go to small claims court? How do I prove that I know he had it?  I was first told by my previous ex who still hangs out with them that they did have it and it was proven when my parents had to go over there and actually get the case back. All I wanted was to get rid of it and get the money for it but now I feel like I\u2019m being forced into calling someone about it. My parents do not want me to take any legal action but then again I have decided to cut all contact with them anyways considering they did nothing to help or prevent him from taking it in the first place. Basically what I said to then was have him give me the magazine back or give me the $350 I paid for it because I\u2019m short on money and I wanted to just get rid of it.",

    "postText": "forgive me as this is kinda confusing, i just don't know how to go about managing this. \n\ni was born in Nevada but when i was 12 i was adopted by my step grandmother in Arizona. she changed my birth certificate to have her name on it and changed my middle name but never updated my social. so my social and my birth certificate have two different names. i want to change my name so i can update all my records, but the only options i have are contacting her directly for the adoption records or completely changing my name on my own. i refuse to contact her for the records as i'm positive she would tell me she doesn't have them anymore, so i'm changing my name on my own. but i want my birth certificate to be amended before doing so. my step grandmother was incredibly abusive to me and now that i'm an adult i would like to take her off my birth certificate. i know that u can go thru a legal adult adoption to change ur birth certificate or get a court order to change it. i want my biological mother put back on my birth certificate, but her rights were terminated and i believe it's a whole thing to have her put back on it. but my main concern is i just REALLY don't want my step grandmother to be notified that she's being removed. is this possible? if not, would getting a living will made ensure that she doesn't have any rights or notification should i die unexpectedly before her? or should i just get married to my partner of 7 years so that he has all the rights and can choose to not inform her? i'm so insanely stressed over this and have been for years i just never knew where to start but i know i should get this done as soon as possible. any advice in the right direction would be extremely helpful!",

If nothing else, social media exists.  \n\n&gt;'m so insanely stressed over this and have been for years i just never knew where to start but i know i should get this done as soon as possible\n\nWhat, exactly, is your goal?",

Do your legal name change in court, and then fill out the paperwork to update SSA.\n\nIn either case, I would never rule out the possibility that she could find something about you or potentially contact you in the future.",

She committed perjury in order to obtain her rights and I just feel like that should be amended. I don't want her to have any access to me or my documents at all anymore. I could skip the paperwork, that's one of my options. But I do not want her to have any awareness of my name change, and if she can still access and obtain my birth certificate she'll be aware of the name change.",

You can decide to go no contact and not have her in your life in a practical sense but we don't have complete control over who our legal parents are. \n\nTrying to go no contact this route is a lot more hassle than it's worth. Are you planning on changing your name every time she finds out your name? That's a lot of work for little pay off.\n\nIf you're an adult... Just go no contact. That's your right. A name change and birth certificate modification aren't needed for that. You have all the tools and right to not have this person in your life already at your disposal.",

You can legally designate someone else as your medical power of attorney, so they would make decisions on your behalf if you are incapacitated. You can also have a will that indicates she is not to be notified of your death. Also, if you want the adoption records, you should be able to get them from your state's office of vital statistics or from the court (depending on the process where you are). You probably can't get your original birth certificate, but you can get the adoption decree.",

Once your an adult all of that only goes to you, your \"mother\" doesn't own you and has no actualright to get a say in what you do. Just go down to the court house, for to get your name change and call it good. I broke off contact with my mother 8yrs ago and when I got married she never even knew I did or that my name change or even what my name is now because they don't notify them.

    "postText": "I own a trademark for the right classes. There has been another music artist who been using the same name as me and after my first usage of it, but has been getting more traction. I would want to send a cease and desist first, hoping he would comply via a lawyer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypothetically based on this info, if he ignores, do I have a good chance of a lawsuit being in my favor already with the trademark? Hoping we don't have to get to that extreme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! ",

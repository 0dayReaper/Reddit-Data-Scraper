    "postText": "So I am a permanent resident of Canada and I am flying to my home country July. My PR card is expiring July 17th so I needed to renew it. I filled out all the appropriate forms and submitted my application March of this year. The IRCC stated at that time the processing time line was 57 days. June rolls around and still no PR card. So I begin calling the IRCC help line. I cal 50/60 times at least go through the slow touch tone sequence and when I finally select to talk with a representative I get hung up on. Not once do I speak with a human. I go to my local member they advocate on my behalf and find out that the IRCC hasn't even processed february's applications yet and their is Zero chance my PR card will be ready. Legally I am unable to re-enter Canada without it. I am flying with my two children who are citizens. I have 8500$ worth of airfares that will not be refunded over this, an uncle dying of cancer I will never see again and a new niece I haven't met yet. My hands are tied and I need to go home.\n\nMy question is what sort of legal action could I bring against the IRCC for their gross incompetence? The seem to operate with complete disregard for how much they impact people's lives. I am beyond frustrated and I would like my voice to be heard legally. ",

            "comment": "IRCC states on their website that the times are approximate and subject to change. It is recommended to renew PR card well in advance. Thus, your case against IRCC is hopeless.\n\nAlso, you are not entirely correct that you can't reenter Canada without a PR card. You are still a PR and if you show up at border crossing, you are entitled to entry. So, you have alternatives:\n\n1. Apply for PRTD (Permanent Resident Travel Document) as soon as you arrive at your destination. It is basically a single-use stamp in your passport that states that you are a PR and let you board a plane.\n\n2. If you can legally enter USA, you can fly to USA and then cross on land. Once you are at the border checkpoint, your PR status will be verified and you will be let in even without PR card or PRTD.",

I am currently attempting to change my return flights to Detroit to enter across the land border. I just would love for there to be some legal recourse. I was given a 57 day processing time and allowed for almost 100 days. For comparison's sake my home countries passport expired this year as well. I sent it via my consulate in Toronto in april to be renewed. It was back and completed in under a month. I have been reading articles about how many people's lives are being ruined because of issues like this at the IRCC. I appreciate you input!",

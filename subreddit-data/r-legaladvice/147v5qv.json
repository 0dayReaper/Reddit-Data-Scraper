    "postText": "I (16F) have been debating on wether or not I should report my ex boyfriend (15M almost 16) to the police for sexual coercion. For background me and him dated for about 2.5 months, and I had told him from the beginning that I didn\u2019t want to do a bunch of sexual stuff because I was assaulted when I was younger, and he told me he understood. \n\nWe had done some sexual things we both consented to, but sometimes I felt pressured a lot. He often asked to see my boobs and when we would hangout he would often put his hand in my shirt and hold my boob. I was always ok with him holding my boob, but when he would ask to see them in person, on call, or through photo I often felt pressured. His way of asking a lot was just say \u201cboobies?\u201d Or something like that. When I didn\u2019t want to I would tell him no but he would be all pouty and I would often send to him. It was a lot of that through the whole time we were dating.\n\nFor the most part I was ok but there were times I wasn\u2019t fully ok with it. One time that I wasn\u2019t fully ok it was about a few days before he broke up with me. He asked to see my body basically by saying \u201cnakey?\u201d And some other things. I sent him full body photos of myself. Later on I found out he had been planning to break up with me for 2 weeks, so about a 1.5 weeks when he asked for the photos. I felt really hurt by this and I\u2019m really tired of just being used for my body over and over again.\n\nOne other thing to add that is important to note. He has a open case going against him for sexual assault. I have heard the stories of the girls and him and many other people. I am very much believe the victim until proven otherwise. The girl that reported him is very manipulative and narcissistic. I don\u2019t believe her I believe my ex-boyfriend. I also have known him for many years and before this all happened. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know if I should report him or not. I don\u2019t know if this is me being angers and hurt by what he did. I really do love him, but this is the first time that I proof of this stuff. The only thing though is when he would ask it was often over call and I would send the pictures over messages so it looks like I\u2019m just sending him photos out of no where. Or there is little conversation before hand but there is only one proof of him directly asking over text. And I have a few over the phone.",

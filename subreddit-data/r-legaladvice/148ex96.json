    "postText": "Once upon a time, my fianc\u00e9 had a venmo account that he forgot the login information for. He created a new account and told most people about the change. This wasn\u2019t an issue until he received a large amount from his mother to help us pay for the wedding (between 1,000 and 2,000 usd). She sent the money without clarifying his information, and it was sent to the venmo account he no longer had access to. He's been calling venmo support repeatedly, proving his identity over and over. At one point (early November 2022), customer support said they would be wire transfer the money back to him. The money never came, and when he called to follow up, they said there was no record of any of the previous conversations he's had with support. Back to square one with proving his identity over and over again. \n\nOur wedding is coming up, and we've been working on this for nearly a year at this point. We were really relying on these funds. Is there anything we can do?",

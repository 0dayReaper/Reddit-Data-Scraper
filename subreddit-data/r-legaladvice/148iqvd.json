    "postText": "Hi all, I have not idea what to do in this situation and I'm coming to you for advice.\n\nMy 82 year old grandmother is going to criminal court on Thursday to plead guilty or not guilty to disobeying a police officer. The incident occurred about a month ago where (according to the affidavit/police report) an officer was blocking traffic into an apartment complex. My grandmother drove up to the \"road block\" where she was instructed to \"back up and turn around.\" My grandmother who is hard of hearing understood that she had to turn around so she passed the police officers vehicle to perform the U turn. This aggravated the police officer who felt that my grandmother had \"breached her perimeter\" and started to yell at my grandmother to stop. Again I wish to remind you all that she is hard of hearing so my grandmother continued to perform her U turn and then left the scene. The police officer got her license plat and filed charges against her for disobeying a police officer. I do not know what to do here, she has to appear virtually in court on Thursday, so I am going over to her house to help her call in as she is not very good with technology. I am also planning on speaking to/for her but I am not sure whether she should plea guilty or not guilty. While she did technically disobey the officers order to \"back up and turn around\" she still turned around. And the maximum sentence for disobeying a police officer is 30 days in jail, I'm just very scared and stressed out because I know she didn't mean to disobey the officer and was just doing what she thought she was told to do.",

            "comment": "In answer to the \"plead guilty or not guilty\" part, the answer is \"not guilty.\"   It sounds like she didn't have a criminal intent -- she just didn't hear the cop.   Typically, she would have a chance to talk to the prosecutor first, and the prosecutor is very likely to offer her some sort of plea deal.   An 82-year-old lady is about the most sympathetic defendant that prosecutor is going to see all day, and no prosecutor wants to put an 82-year-old in jail, period, let alone for 30 days.\n\nBeing represented by a lawyer would be a really, really good idea.\n\nIf she chooses to go without a lawyer, she should talk about why she didn't hear the cop -- her hearing aid was out of batteries, or she forgot to put her hearing aid in, or whatever.   (Just not \"I'm hard of hearing and I don't wear a hearing aid.\")   THe idea is to demonstrate that this was a one-time thing, unlikely to happen again, no harm, no foul.   Frankly, the most likely end result is that her driver's license is taken away, and she doesn't want to hand somebody ammunition to be able to say that she shouldn't be on the road.",

No way in Hell I would ever do anything to her as a prosecutor, unless she put people in danger.  There is no way your granny will ever see the inside of a cell.  She may have to pay a small fine, but I even doubt that.  I would give her driving school + court costs and dismiss the charge or something like that, which is known as a deferred prosecution.  I would then have a serious conversation with my police officer about using her discretion more appropriately.  Again, this is assuming no live were ever in danger.  \n\nTell your grandmother to plead not guilty.  She can talk to the prosecutor after that and explain she didn't hear the command.  That doesn't mean your granny is too old to drive.  It means the officer didn't give clear commands.  If the prosecutor is a hard ass, then go to hire an attorney.  Nothing your granny says to the prosecutor will be used against her, as she is attempting to settle the case, and that won't come into evidence.  \n\nJust talk to the prosecutor like a human, and I think you will have your best outcome.  If that fails, hire a local attorney to have him/her move forward on a deferred prosecution.",

    "postText": "We have lived in our neighborhood for about 5 years and get along with all our neighbors. We host a big neighborhood party every year and have had zero incidents. Our kids are in elementary school and are in home and in bed at an early hour. We know all their friends and they aren\u2019t yet old enough to travel around the neighborhood without an adult - they play at friends homes or at home with friends. We are chill people who just hang out at home - super average family. Boring, one might say. That\u2019s what makes this so confusing.\n\nMultiple times a year we are woken up by kids ding dong ditching us. It\u2019s beginning to escalate where the kids stand outside and call us names (a see you next Tuesday was just added to their repertoire) and yell at us to come fight them. These kids are probably in high school. My in laws live across the street from us and saw the kids taking selfies in our yard and when they saw they were being watched, they stood in their yard and stared at them until the police showed up. They ran off into the yards close by and were not caught.\n\nWe call the police each time and are finally buying a ring camera (which we have never wanted to do but we acknowledge it\u2019s time).\n\nThe police only patrol the neighborhood when it happens. They have never found the kids. Rumors are that they are the ones who tip over port a potties at the park and have stolen political signs during election years. But we don\u2019t know for a fact who they are. We just have a rough idea.\n\nCan we file a report with them? Will the police do this? Beyond a camera what more can we do? They obviously know who we are and I don\u2019t want any further escalation. We just want them to stop. I want it on record that this is happening so there is a paper trail\nIf it gets worse. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a thing.",

You can file a report with the police to document it, though you'd have no way of establishing the perpetrators. \n\n&gt; Beyond a camera what more can we do?

A few decades ago in the same town, I was followed by a car I didn\u2019t know. I called the police and they pulled us both over and didn\u2019t do anything to those following me. Just sent me on my way and the car following me.",

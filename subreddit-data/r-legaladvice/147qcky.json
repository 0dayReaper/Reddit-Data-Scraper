    "postText": "I applied for a coding bootcamp about two years ago. During the application process I took out a loan with Launch Servicing. At the time I wasn't sure of the full amount of the coding bootcamp so I took out the full value of the loan (approximately 24K). 8K went to me and the rest was dispursed to the bootcamp. \nDuring a call with a bootcamp representative they let me know the bootcamp was only 10k and would return the difference to Launch Servicing. By the looks of it, it was never returned. I've reached out to Launch (now Ascent) and they directed me to go back to the bootcamp to resolve the discrepancy. When I reached out to the bootcamp they essentially said they couldn't help me. Their exact words were \"Unfortunately, we cannot disclose that information to students.\" I've now asked for a receipt of payments made, explained the situation, and asked if they are saying there's nothing that can be done. \nThat's roughly $6000 that has now gone MIA that I am being charged interest on (and its no small interest fee) and I have to pay back. \nWhat are my options here?",

    "postText": "Location: Cleveland, Ohio\n\nLast week, I (23m) was involved in a minor car accident when another driver (20f) slightly hit the rear corner of my car on the driver's side. Fortunately, the damage is minimal, but the issue arose when I discovered that the other driver does not have insurance, whereas I do. Now I'm concerned about potential consequences for my insurance and what options I have to get my car fixed without increasing my monthly premiums.I'm seeking advice on the following questions:\n\n1. Will my insurance rates increase if I file a claim? Since I have insurance coverage, I'm considering filing a claim to have my car repaired. However, I'm worried about the potential impact on my monthly premiums. Can I expect an increase, even though I'm not at fault and the other driver is uninsured? I have Allstate but I don't have uninsured motorist coverage.\n\n2. Is there any way to get my car fixed without involving my insurance? If possible, I would prefer to avoid filing a claim with my insurance company to prevent any potential increase in premiums. Are there alternative options for getting my car repaired in this situation? I have already talked with the other driver but they told me they cannot pay for the repairs on my car as it is to expensive (went to a body shop and showed them the receipt for $1200)\n\n3. What steps should I take to protect myself legally and financially? Given that the other driver doesn't have insurance, I want to make sure I'm taking the right steps to protect myself both legally and financially. Are there any specific actions or procedures I should follow in Ohio to ensure I'm covering all bases? I obviously did not file an insurance claim yet but I did file a police report, which caused a bunch of lawyer offices to call me the next day, I don't wanna ruin this college student's life I just want my car repaired.\n\nI'd be really grateful for any advice or guidance you could provide. Dealing with this is new to me, and I just want to make sure I handle everything properly. Thanks so much in advance!",

            "comment": "1: Yes your insurance will go up (hard to say how much, that depends on how long you've been with them).  Claims will generally stay on your policy for 3-5 years depending on the Insurer.  But the surcharge will decrease slightly each year (premium will go up the first year and then slowly down each year that you continue loss free).  \n\nSome Insurers offer accident forgiveness if you've been with them a long time, so definitely look into that.\n\n2: Yes, pay out of pocket and then take them to small claims court to recoup the money.  I would also look into getting a few more quotes for repairs, you should try to get at least 3.\n\n3: Since you filed a police report and you want to protect yourself you really should turn it into your Insurance carrier.  I doubt the other party will do anything but in the long run it's better safe than sorry (legally and financially).\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you...this happened to me once when I was in my teens, I had someone pull out in front of me and slam on their brakes, I bumped them, without insurance they asked for a bunch of money to fix a tiny scratch...I managed to come up with it, lesson learned the hard way.  It's a lesson everyone has to learn and you're not really doing the other driver any favors by not expecting them to pay for their mistake.",

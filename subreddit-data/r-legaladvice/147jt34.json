    "postText": "There is a small business that owns the rights to a discontinued product. It is a mold for a few sculpts for semi-mass produced resin figures. They are still producing products but only products for a totally different thing. They stopped reproducing these sculpts but they still own the mold and sculpt rights. The product was discontinued in 2014 and after inquiring the company a few times throughout the years, they have stated that they have no plans to restock or make it again. \n\nSince they aren't making them again, I am seriously interested in acquiring the rights to these mold/sculpts. I have a couple ten grand but I don't think I want to spend that much for this. The business is quite small (about 10 employees total).\n\nWhat is a possible way to approach a company and say that I'd like to purchase their molds/sculpt rights? Could you give me an example of what a possible offer would look like if I'd like to offer the least amount of money as possible, while sounding very convincing?",

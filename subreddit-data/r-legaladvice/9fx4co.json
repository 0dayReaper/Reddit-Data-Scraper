    "postText": "My daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. I killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. \n\nMy wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. \n\nCan I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. \n\nI need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. \n\nI am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. \n\nIs it kidnapping in this case?\n\nWill I be arrested? \n\nWhat do I do if she calls in an amber alert?\n\nI am desperate.",

            "comment": "Microbiologist here: I test for rabies at my job on a daily basis, often on raccoons. OP, you mentioned killing the animal, and I strongly suggest you contact you local animal control (or whatever equivalent you have in Texas) immediately and have them take the carcass in for testing. Try to do this sooner rather than later, as the window for definitive testing is limited. If your wife does try to cause you problems later on, it may be helpful to your case to have a laboratory report, even if it ends up the animal was negative for rabies. Its just more paper trail showing that an animal bite did occur, and you had a serious and valid concern and feared for your daughter's safety. It may help prevent her from trying to claim there was never any injury, you were just using it as an excuse to take her away, etc. \n\nAlso, take it from someone who has cultured raccoon mouths: they are full of horrifying bacteria. Even if rabies was not a concern, a severe bacterial infection could occur and your little girl still needs to be treated. I sincerely respect you for doing what's best for your daughter, and saying the hell with your wife's anti-vaxxer beliefs. And you can bet your ass your little girl knows her dad loves her ",

Also, if you can get her admitted to hospital that would mean any theoretical child seeking police would need to talk to hospital staff about the situation, which would also help you.\n\n",

It will be 4 shots today (unless they\u2019ve changed it, I haven\u2019t given the vaccine in a few years now), plus additional on days 3, 7 and 14.  This won\u2019t be a one and done deal and in order for it to work she must get all shots and on the days they specify to you. \n\nIf you think your wife will do the same as what you are doing for the opposite reason (take her away in 3 days so that you can\u2019t get the next shots), say something to the hospital today.  They will get social services involved and likely CPS.  This won\u2019t be something you can hide from your wife (there may be pain at the injection site, she could see the bandaids, a verbal child might say something, a bill will come in the mail, you may get a reminder call to the house to come in for your shots the day before), and you don\u2019t want to wait until day 3 or the other days and run into an issue of not being able to find your child. Once you show symptoms, there isn\u2019t really anything you can do. You don\u2019t want to miss any shots.\n\nIn regards to what the ED physician said about having a judge grant temporary custody to the state, it is 100% true (like everything he/she said). I\u2019ve had kids come up from ED where that happened for refusing to consent for a medically necessary test. Your wife does not want to mess around with CPS and the law. IANAL but I\u2019d be more worried about what your wife is doing then what you are doing. You are doing the right thing. ",

The next day, I went to get checked out, and just yesterday, I finished my last rabies shot. Rabies is something you cannot mess around with, as you already know. \n\nIt would be at the very least gross negligence if not willful endangering of your child's life to not follow through with the rabies vaccines, especially given that unlike in my case, you know for a fact that the raccoon may have had rabies. I would continue as you were planning to do. I would also reach out to a lawyer and child services. If you have textual evidence that your wife opposed giving your daughter the life-saving treatment she needs, save it- save it all! Should the police make trouble, I would explain the situation to them- most should (hopefully) understand. \n\nThe series are spread out over the course of roughly one month. The first two are administered on the same day (the prophylaxis and the first rabies shot), then the second 3 days later, the third 4 days after that, the  fourth 7 days after, and the last one two weeks later. Missing any of these severely blunts the effectiveness of the treatment. You already seem like that kind of a father, but I might give your daughter some ice cream or some other treat after each shot. As a human pincushion, I wasn't fazed by them, but I can see these shots being uncomfortable for kids. \n\nBest of luck to you, mate.",

In the event you are concerned your wife will attempt to prevent your daughter from getting the treatment, you may want to get in touch with child protective services/family services in your area, and see what your options are for protecting your kid.

    "postText": "I live in Tennessee and I was pulled over and cited for going 29mph over the speed limit. I was driving my girlfriends car with her at the time. She doesn\u2019t have insurance for the car, and I told the officer I didn\u2019t know if they did and that there wasn\u2019t any cards in the car. Can i get insurance before my court date (July 13th) and then give them those cards and will that work and the fines will be dropped? Or will they know I got insurance after the fact? And if I don\u2019t ever get proof of insurance will I just pay a fine or will I get my license revoked or something. My girlfriend and her entire family is undocumented and I am terrified that I just got them all deported because I wasn\u2019t paying attention.",

You will have to pay the fines, and provide an SR-22 insurance evidence, to avoid suspension of your license and of the car's registration.\n\n\n&gt; if I don\u2019t ever get proof of insurance will I just pay a fine or will I get my license revoked or something.\n\nYour license will be suspended, as will the license of the registered owner, and the vehicle registration.\n\n&gt;I am terrified that I just got them all deported\n\nRealistically, it's fortunate that you were the one behind the wheel.   \n\nThe immigration status of the owner or passengers is not relevant, and as long as you pay the fines and provide proof of insurance (SR-22) the worst outcome will be the court costs you pay and the extra insurance costs.\n\nIf your girlfriend's family decides to screw you by not getting insurance, they will also expose themselves to greater law enforcement scrutiny by driving on a suspended registration.   This also increases the probability of impoundment.\n\nIf the fines get paid, this can be a few-hundred-dollars mistake.",

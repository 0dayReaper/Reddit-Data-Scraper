    "postText": "I am in California and am employed by a university as a doctoral student and TA. Our status at the university is a sometimes-confusing amalgam of employee and student. I am seeking information on how to pressure my employer into compensating me. I am waiting for a paycheck that has been delayed since February.\n\nDetails:\n\n* I did some \"contract\" work subbing for an instructor on medical leave and was told I would be paid a certain amount for this labor. This is in writing.\n* I was told that money would show up on my April paycheck, but it did not. This is also in writing.\n* The paycheck seems to be in bureaucratic limbo between departments (my academic department, payroll office, and HR office), but I have yet to be given specific information as to when I can expect payment or what the nature of the delay is despite *repeated* *follow-ups since April 2nd.*\n* I have already filed a grievance with the union, but since labor relations have been outsourced to an offsite, non-academic law firm, there has been no progress yet.\n* I have emailed the Ombuds office, HR, and Payroll independently to no avail.\n\nCan I pursue legal action for unpaid wages? How can I pressure my employer to pay me owed wages in a manner they will appreciate?\n\nI want to avoid being mired in the legal process, but I recognize that threats of legal action are the currency of bureaucracy and are more effective than appeals to compliance by a lowly doctoral student. To say that I am relying on this paycheck would be an understatement. \n\nAny advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated.",

    "postText": "Went in for my biannual dental cleaning, at the end of which they applied fluoride to my teeth. At the visit, they said \"here's the fluoride\" and applied it without asking me, or without telling me that I have to pay for it out of pocket. And what's really frustrating is that this is not the first but the THIRD time they have provided a treatment that I have not explicitly consented to. I have plenty of experience working in clinical research, writing clinical protocols &amp; consents, and working with IRBs, so I have a strong understanding of what it means to provide consent. Do I have any legal ground to stand on in terms of getting a refund for the costs I paid out of pocket?\n\nNote 1: I get that fluoride is recommended and ultimately beneficial for my oral hygiene, but in neither case did they even 1) ask me if I wanted it, or 2) tell me that it's a supplemental care that is NOT covered by insurance, thus I was stuck paying $50 out of pocket.\n\nNote 2: I know it's not my dentist's/hygienist's responsibility to know what each patient's insurance plan covers vs does not cover. But one thing remains: 99% of dental insurance providers do NOT cover fluoride treatment for adults, so they're likely operating under the assumption that we as patients will almost certainly be paying for the treatment out of pocket.\n\nNote 3: At a different previous visit when I was getting a filling, they placed a pulp cap (which is also considered a 'supplemental' treatment that is not covered by insurance) without ever telling me they were doing this, or that it would cost me. So between the two fluoride treatments and this pulp cap, they have now on three separate occasions provided treatments without my consent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Added since the post has been locked:** For context, this is a large dental practice with multiple providers. In my last four (and only four) visits to this practice, I have seen three different dentists. They do genuinely seem to provide great dental care, but there is clearly a pattern of miscommunication and borderline negligence given their willingness to perform these 'extra' treatments without obtaining my consent beforehand.",

When you consented for treatment, you technically consented for a standard cleaning and fluoride treatment is considered standard practice. They should have told you and gave you the option to opt out- that was shitty, but I don't think you have any legal recourse. Unfortunately,  dentists have hardly any regulations when it comes to billing. They have some, but it's nothing compared to medical providers. They can get away with too much.\n\n\nEdit for typos\n\nEdit to add: When I said fluoride is considered standard practice- I should have been clearer. A lot of dental offices consider it standard practice, it may not be standard to all, and it's not standard to insurance companies. They really should have made you aware of it, though.  Most offices do take the stance that you should know your benefits- which is true,  but you should be made aware of anything being performed above cleaning, x-rays,  and exam. You should call the office manager, you may be able to dispute the charge and get it written-off.",

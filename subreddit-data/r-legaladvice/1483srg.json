    "postText": "My neighbor believes part of my yard is his property. We\u2019ve been arbitrating this through our towns conservation committee as there are some conservation implications to the project he\u2019d like to do (bulldoze a 30 yard driveway through a stream and my yard/driveway, claiming he needs it to access his house, although he already has a driveway). \n\nToday, he parked a large bulldozer in my yard and left it there. Moved all of my lawn furniture and fire pit out of the way to do it. The police are saying it\u2019s a civil matter and they cannot help. The conservation committee is slow to arbitrate.\n\nIs he breaking any laws by doing this, and if so, what can I do about it? Can I trespass him? Can I have the machinery removed by force? Any help would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "* Pull your deed, survey and title policy from the initial sale. \n- The deed will have your legal description, hopefully with full metes and bounds from a survey. It also should state whether any reservations (if any, such as, you get the property but neighbor retains access via an easement on your property that you can't obstruct). \n- if you can't pull a survey, order one ASAP.\n- Your policy will list out any encumbrances or restrictions/easements of record with the county that affect your property. The documents are public record and can be accessed via the county clerk to review and see the terms set forth, duration and typically reference additional Plat documents for you to gather. \n\n* Document, document, document. Pictures of the issue, with the house or a relative landmark visible to gauge location on property, neighbor's statements, dates, etc. You can never cover your ass too much just in case things escalate legally. Be over prepared. \n\n* Should it escalate to a property dispute, reach out to the title company that closed your purchase and speak with their claims department. Their legal resources are efficient and will be able to assist in confirming whether the neighbor has any standing. Nobody works harder than an attorney avoiding a claim against their company.",

My driveway overlaps with that conservation-designated space (not sure why, I didn\u2019t build). He is trying to claim that area as his own. I\u2019m more asking about if I have any recourse for him destroying my lawn and obstructing my yard with his machinery. Based on your answer it seems like it depends on who has the legal right to the conservation area, if anyone does at all. Appreciate the insight.",

That said, it doesn't mean that the land becomes a 'no-man's land'. It should still belong to either you or your neighbor.\n\n**Question** \\- When you bought the house, did you have a survey taken of the property? This is sometimes required by your financing company and could help you better understand ownership of this area. If not, you should consider having one done.",

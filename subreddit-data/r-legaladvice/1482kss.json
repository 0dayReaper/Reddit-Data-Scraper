    "postText": "My ex and I went through a very bad break up about a month ago. It's a long story but I'll try to make it as concise as possible. The details are important because the relationship was very tumultuous. My ex and I were broken up for 6 months but then got back together to give it another shot. A month after getting back together she got really drunk at a party at my house and yelled at me in a way that was very unwarranted. She demanded I tell her how many people I slept with in my room when we were apart and I refused to answer because I felt like its none of her business what I did when we were separated. She kept demanding I tell her and wouldn't stop yelling until I had to leave the party. She followed me outside yelling and refused to leave when I asked her to. It was an ugly sight and one that I'm embarrassed about because it happened in front of all my friends and some of my neighbors. After that incident I was unsure of our relationship there on. When I voiced my concerns and asked to slow things down she would threaten to kill herself. So I stayed around for the next couple of months with one foot out of the door ready to leave. It was a rocky couple of months full of uncertainty. Now that you're caught up I'll go over the incident. \n\nI went over to her apartment in the hopes of having a civil conversation about breaking up. The fights were getting tiresome and I felt bad keeping the relationship going when I was unsure about it. I knew it was a bad idea going to her house but I wasn't thinking clearly. Her neighborhood doesn't have parking so I'm forced to park my car in her apartments parking garage which she only has the remote to open and close. As soon as I park and enter her apartment we start arguing. She's unable to understand my side for wanting to end things and begins attacking my character. She demands to see my phone to see if I'm on Onlyfans talking to girls and I tell her once again it's not her business since I've been wanting to break up for the last few weeks anyway and she keeps threatening to hurt herself every time I bring it up. I'm not proud of being on onlyfans behind her back but at the end of the day it's not illegal to be on it. I tell her I don't want to argue anymore and just want to leave, but she had the garage door opener and refused to let me leave until I showed her my phone. I told her its not going to happen knowing full well that the fight will just get 100x worse if she sees it. So I sit in my car in her parking garage waiting for one of her neighbors to leave or arrive. My ex comes storming out yelling at me for the whole apartment complex to hear. I plead for her to just let me out and we can talk about this more later on the phone but she refused to let me out. I was literally trapped. She then reaches into my car and grabs my phone out of my hands. I exit the car and try to grab my phone out of her hands but she wouldnt let go. In an attempt to loosen her grip i push my body into hers and she falls back on the asphalt. I feel bad for knocking her down and when I try to help her up she screams that I assaulted her and pushed me away. I'm embarrassed now since her whole apartment complex could hear this altercation so I get in my car and drive toward the closed gate. I yell at her through my window telling her that if she doesn't open the gate I will call the police and say I'm being trapped. She says that she'll tell them that I assaulted her. I believe what I did was in self defense so I call the police anyway. When she sees that I'm actually doing it she finally opens the gate and lets me out. I drive out and hang up the police call.\n\nIt was very ugly and I'm not proud of how it unfolded. Anyways, she told me that she filed a police report against me and is telling everyone that I assaulted her. Is what I did considered assault? Is it not self defense? Is what she did considered False imprisonment and theft (being trapped in her garage and her taking my phone)? If she is really going around telling people that I assaulted her and filed a police report, should I do anything to defend myself? I don't want to be in the police system for assault when no one has heard my side of the story. I really don't know what to do and any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",

It could also be considered \"mutual affray\".\n\n&gt;Is what she did considered False imprisonment\n\nNo.  You could very probably have walked out of the garage through an emergency door. \n\n&gt;and theft\n\nThe phone, yes.  The car, probably not.\n\n&gt;should I do anything to defend myself\n\n1.   Block her number and do not go anywhere near her home.\n\n1.  STFU.\n\nI mean the second one in a thorough and complete manner.  \n\nDo not speak to police.   Do not tell your side of the story, or present a defense, or make a counterclaim: all of those only confirm parts of her allegations.    Do not answer *any* questions, even if arrested or booked or interrogated.\n\n&gt;no one has heard my side of the story\n\nIt's painful because we all don't want to have our reputations smeared without a response.   But when there could be a criminal complaint, the only thing you should say is \"I will not answer any questions\", and \"I want to speak with an attorney\".    Then DO NOT answer any questions, and discuss the matter only with your attorney.\n\n&gt;a civil conversation about breaking up.\n\nI hereby declare you broken up.   You don't need to do any additional actions or declarations or discussions.",

I felt the need to explain the details of our past because she has a history of erratic and antagonistic behavior and threatening me with self harm to herself.  I try to leave situations when they get ugly but she has a history of pushing things to a breaking point and me fighting for my phone was that point. \n\nThe thing I don't understand is, what is a person supposed to do when their property is forcibly taken from them? \n\nAnd yes I could've left through the front gate but I'd still have my car there and she doesn't live in the best neighborhood. I didn't feel like wandering the sketchy streets and leaving my car at her place just to get towed. I quite literally felt trapped. \n\nI still haven't received anything in the mail regarding any report being filed. Do they usually let the person know? Should I just wait it out before getting a lawyer?",

                            "comment": "&gt; what is a person supposed to do when their property is forcibly taken from them?\n\nIn most places you can use a reasonable degree of force to retain or regain possession of your property.   Where you cross the line into assault is a question of the totality of circumstances.\n\n&gt;I quite literally felt trapped.\n\nBut you weren't.   Her sketchy neighborhood isn't an imminent threat of harm.   Police will certainly not investigate her for false imprisonment, nor could I imagine a conviction on this set of facts.\n\n&gt;Do they usually let the person know? \n\nIn the event that you are charged with assault without police attending the scene of the report, usually you find out because you receive a summons, or police come to your door to execute an arrest warrant.\n\n&gt;Should I just wait it out before getting a lawyer?\n\nIn practice, a lot of people find out about this kind of criminal charge because attorneys scrape the local court records and send you a helpful advertisement for their services.   \n\nIt can't hurt to have the phone number of a criminal defense attorney handy, but until you hear about a charge or warrant, you don't need one.   You can always pay one for a consultation and an in-person pep talk about the theory and practice of invoking and then exercising your 5th Amendment right to STFU.\n\nUnless she has custody or control of children, pets, or large amounts of your property, your best course of action is to ignore her completely and resolve not to answer any questions if police (or really anyone else) asks you questions about the incident.",

Is any of that even necessary in defending myself?",

Call the police if she refuses.\n\nIf you could have left, even without your car, it\u2019s not false imprisonment. You could have called police to possibly have her open the garage.

    "postText": "Hello, fellow Redditors! I find myself in a complicated situation and could really use some legal support and guidance. I'm a US citizen with dual Uzbek citizenship, and my ex-girlfriend, who also holds Uzbek citizenship, resides in Dubai, UAE. We had filed an I-129F Fianc\u00e9 Visa last year, but unfortunately, things took an unexpected turn during my visit to Dubai in May. We broke up, and I subsequently sent a cancellation request for our I-129F Visa.\nTo my surprise, I recently discovered that my ex-girlfriend is pregnant. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether I am the father or not. Given the circumstances, I am seeking advice on the appropriate course of action in this complex situation. Here are a few specific questions I have:\n\nShould we both take a DNA testing? \nIf the child is indeed mine, what are my obligations? \n\nShould I initiate child support or let her file for it? \n\nCan a legal document be created to establish a monthly support arrangement?",

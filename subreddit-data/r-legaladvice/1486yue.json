    "postText": "So I discovered a whole host of hazardous conditions in the 2 weeks I\u2019ve been here since moving to a very rural location. I signed the lease with my SO without ever seeing the place in person, (I know, never again).\n\nI texted my landlord and ensured that I had recorded all conversations with them before moving forward.\n\nThey had wanted me to talk on the phone with them, to which I told them I would wait for a text reply.\n\nI texted them basically: \u201cIt has come to our attention there are these hazardous conditions: non functional smoke alarm, non functional CO alarm, black mold covering interior of AC unit and dehumidifier, black mold in the microwave, huge urine stains and a fecal stain on the mattress, smell of something decaying in the walls in bedroom, and I want you to take action to fix these conditions in the next 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t reply in a text but they did come over without warning; I suppose the saying I wanted them to take action in the next 24 hours was invitation enough to come over unannounced.\n\nI made sure to start recording before I opened the door and\u2026 they started yelling at me as soon as I said \u201cI\u2019ll show you what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThey yelled for a good 10 minutes at me and my SO while they kept yelling I reached for my pepper spray because truly I felt unsafe, I felt intimidated, and I felt like they and the other person they brought over- who we had never seen- might start swinging at us. They acknowledged that and asked why I was picking up pepper spray. To which I said simply, shaken: \u201cI feel unsafe\u201d on the recording.\n\nThey said \u201cFuck you, you entitled millennials.\u201d And said a bunch of other things that made us feel unsafe and like outsiders, because we\u2019re not from here.\n\nWe showed them the mold, the urine, the non working smoke alarm and they dismissed all of it and said \u201cwe\u2019re fixing it\u201d you just have to request it like \u2018reasonable\u2019 people.\u201d\n\nJust for the record I asked them if they would *choose* to sleep on a mattress that had urine or feces on it and they kept skirting around the question but eventually landed on \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t choose to sleep on a mattress that has urine stains.\u201d\n\nSo why should we?\n\nThey didn\u2019t fix the mold said it was \u201cdirt\u201d, didn\u2019t change the mattress, just offered another mattress protector on top of the one we already have. Brought a different smoke alarm than the non functioning one.\n\nI have no words. I thought they would fix the truly concerning stuff. Instead they just yelled at us and told us that we can break the contract early but we lose our $1000 security deposit. That\u2019s not the worst result but honestly\u2026\n\nScrew them, they had no right to storm into our place and intimidate us like that.\n\nI got the whole conversation on recording, is this grounds to sue, and what could we potentially get out of it?",

I\u2019m NAL and am not very knowledgeable about legal matters, but I feel the answer to this question could possibly be helpful/relevant to others here who are able to help - at least regarding the legality of recording someone (ex. if it\u2019s a 1 party or 2 party consent state)",

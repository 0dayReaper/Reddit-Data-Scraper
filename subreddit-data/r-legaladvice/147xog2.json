    "postText": "The reason I'm curious... My stepson (11 years old) shared with me that he was at a friends house and they were playing in the woods. They inadvertently roamed onto a neighbor's property and that neighbor approached the kids and asked them to leave. It sounds like they may not have left swiftly enough, so he then proceeded to follow them off of his property, threaten to call police, and was supposedly taking pictures and possibly video. Does the neighbor have the legal right to record them in that way, or is it technically illegal if the kids (or perhaps their parents, being that they were all minors) did not consent? \n\nFor the record, I don't really feel any type of way about him recording them. In my mind, it sounds like he asked them to leave and they probably lingered and maybe talked back. I can understand him wanting some kind of evidence in case they came back or the situation escalated. However, my stepson asserted that it was \"totally illegal\" for him to take pictures of them but, being 11, he makes a lot of claims with 100% confidence and 0% accuracy. I've tried searching for an answer but it's not really clear and I can't find much that isn't specifically talking about conversations.",

    "postText": "Hi all. \n\nI'm currently having a situation with the insurance company my state mandated disability claim is with.\n\nI had a procedure in March which resulted in me being sent home from work in April until I am cleared by a doc. I've had trouble getting paperwork out of the Docs office for the insurance company. I have updated the insurance company every single step of the way and FINALLY receive some paperwork. Then I call the insurance and they tell me \" we can't approve the claim until you get x y and z\" which they never told me before. They told me I needed the physicians statement. So I uploaded the documents requested.\n\n\nThe claim analyst left me a voice-mail saying I returned to work on April 2 and have not updated them since. This is false. I've called multiple times and explained. They told me my claim should be approved within the day LAST WEEK. No movement on my claim yet. It has been almost 3 months without pay and I'm going in to debt because of this. I asked to speak with someone who can remove the analyst from my claim and assign a new one. They transferred me to the current analyst supervisor who's voice-mail was not active and I could not get a hold of him. \n\nI am not sure what to do at this point and I think my fmla days are going to completely exhausted at this point and I may not be able to return before that happens. \n\nAny advice?",

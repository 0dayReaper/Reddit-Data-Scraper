None of her family members want anything to do with her, so highly doubtful anyone is going to come up with 7.5k to bail her out. \n\nTrying to figure out all the different REALISTIC lengths of time she could be in jail\n\nThis occurred in Arkansas.  \n\n1)  Arkansas requires a trial AFTER the review hearing within 9 months.  How many months can we expect before trial?\n\n2)  If she is found incompetent to stand trial, does she just go to a mental institute for the rest of her life?\n\n3) Odds of her doing a plea bargain and getting a slap on the wrist as it's her first felony and being let go with no jail time?\n\n4)  Realistic length of jail time if sentenced?  Class A Arson Felony shows 6-10 years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the majority of these questions are VERY broad, but am asking based off of your experience, as I have none....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf more info is needed, just ask....  \n\n\nBIG thanks!",

I know these have to be really hard to answer....\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what would a plea bargain look like in your opinion?  Plea guilty and then no jail at all, just let go and forced to pay restitution for decades?     \n\n\nIF she claimed insanity or was found incompetent, what would that look like?  \n\n\nThanks!",

Not in Arkansas. \n\n&gt;Multiple witnesses, 100% guilty....\n\nHaving done it and 100% guilty are not the same thing. \n\n&gt;She pled not guilty, because she's currently manic. \n\nGood. This is the right thing to do.\n\n&gt;1) Arkansas requires a trial AFTER the review hearing within 9 months. How many months can we expect before trial?\n\nIs she getting a psychological evaluation? That could change the timeline. \n\n&gt;2) If she is found incompetent to stand trial, does she just go to a mental institute for the rest of her life?\n\nNo, she will go to the state hospital and participate in restoration services so she can be competent to stand trial.  Once she is competent,  she will go to trial. \n\n&gt;3) Odds of her doing a plea bargain and getting a slap on the wrist as it's her first felony and being let go with no jail time?\n\nIt's unclear whether or not her attorney is using a mental health defense or not. Not competent to stand trial, not guilty except for insanity,  and criminal mitigation may be possibilities.  Those are different than a plea bargain.",

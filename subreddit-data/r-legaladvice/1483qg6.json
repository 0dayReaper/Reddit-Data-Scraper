    "postText": "I relocated to Dallas County, Texas to reside with my spouse. I lived there for approximately 10 months until my spouse left me. Subsequently, my mother\u2019s spouse also left her. As a result, I had to move back home to a remote location about 150 miles south of Dallas/Dallas County. Given that my mother\u2019s spouse left her and she is elderly, I had to take on the responsibility of financially supporting her. \n\nThis meant that I was unable to pay my unsecured debt.Last week, I discovered that two lawsuits were filed in Dallas County against me. Despite living far away, I only found out about the lawsuits when my CashApp account was frozen. Upon calling the number provided to me, I was informed that a receiver had been appointed.\n\nThe lines of credit were opened in the county where I currently reside as I had only lived in Dallas for a short period of time. Is there any way to have the cases closed? How would I go about having the receiver removed? What motion would I need to file? Given the lack of personal jurisdiction, I believe that I could have the suits dismissed?  Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.",

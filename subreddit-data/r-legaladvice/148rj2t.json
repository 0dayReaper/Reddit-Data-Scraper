    "postText": "My girlfriend just had to put her dog down because it got sick really sick. She's still heartbroken over it and had to scrape together enough money to have her put down. Prior to doing so we looked at her insurance policy which said it will reimburse \"covered veterinary expenses\" including mortality benefit as defined below:\n\n%%%%\n\nMortality Benefit:\nWe will pay covered veterinary expenses that you incur during your policy term for fees associated with the death of your pet due to injury or illness. We will pay for: 1) a veterinarian to humanely euthanize your pet, 2) cremation and burial expenses, and 3) the price you paid for your pet up to a maximum benefit of $1000. \n\nWe will not pay for the price you paid for your pet if your dog was (8) years of age of older or your cat was (10) years of age or older at the time of death and died or was euthanized due to an illness; or your veterinarian is not able to verify the death of your pet and sign the claim form. \n\n%%%%\n\nMy girlfriend got the claim form signed and submitted but the insurance company is claiming since the dog was over 8 years old nothing at all is covered. Per the text in the policy is says the price you paid for the pet is not covered (item 3) which we totally understand. But it still seems to say euthanization is a covered expense so they should be reimbursing items 1 and 2. \n\nI think the insurance company is trying to scam her while she's already distraught about the death of her dog.",

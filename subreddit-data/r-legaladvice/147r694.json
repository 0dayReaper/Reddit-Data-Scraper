    "postText": "I recently received an equity grant from my employer. They have (adjacently) been asking me to sign a fairly broad and bullshit noncompete agreement after 4 years of working without. I declined. So, they tied the non compete to my grant acceptance within the fidelity system... As in, the only way to accept my grants (that I earned), I have to sign this shit. Is this even legal to restrict access to an earned benefit by locking them behind a contract that I don't agree with? A contract that was not presented to me before I accepted employment? As noted, I've been here for 4 years without. Now all of the sudden I must to continue forward with benefits. Feels shady to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

            "comment": "It is pretty normal to tie additional employment terms to incentives like equity grants.  If you don't want the non-compete, you do not have to accept the grant.  Things become problematic (in some states) when it becomes: 'sign this or get fired', but tying it to a new compensation package is less-terrible.\n\nNow, all of that is separate from if the agreement they've written is enforceable, but the fact remains that the general concept is pretty typical.",

I know MN just passed a law that bans almost all non-compete clauses after quitting/termination and other states have various limits to non-competes, as well as the NLRB recently severely limiting the potential scope of non-competes",

If you already had a written, executed agreement with them for the equity grant and THEN they tried to throw in the non-compete, that might be different, but if their attorneys are competent, your award agreement will probably require you to sign a stockholder's agreement or something similar when your equity vests, which can also include a non-compete. They are giving you equity in the company, they'd be silly not to protect themselves if they can.",

    "postText": "I have a declaration of trust with my ex. It says that aside from the deposit that I put in (I know I will get that back) that we have equal responsibility for mortgage payments.\n\nHowever, the relationship broke down and I am going to buy my ex out of their share. \n\nAs we have equal responsibility, am I able to back-date the payments I made (I always paid more than my ex into the mortgage and some months they didn't pay anything at all especially towards the end) so that I can deduct the equivalent off the end buy-out amount?\n\ne.g. if we were legally equally responsible for payments, but I always paid \u00a3200 more per month than them over a period of 4 years, would I be able to deduct \u00a39,600 from the end buy-out amount?

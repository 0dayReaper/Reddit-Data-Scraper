    "postText": "Hi, My ex and I got a no fault divorce and the divorce was quite amicable and fair. No solicitors where involved and we agreed shared custody without it being legal. \n\nWe are going to sell house soon and go our seperate ways. I will be renting and she will be buying. Anyway, only way I can afford to rent is to live with someone so I am going to live with my best mate. When I informed my ex of this, she said I couldn't live with anyone incase that person was a paedophile etc which he isn't obviously. \n\nDoes she have a right to say who I can live with moving forward as our child will be living with me half the time.",

            "comment": "Not without a court order, no. \u201cYour best friend might be a pedophile\u201d is not enough to justify her position. I suppose she could attempt to modify custody, but that sounds highly unlikely. She might have a better chance if your friend *had* actually been convicted of pedophilia, but unless that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t think she has a leg to stand on.\n\nI suppose you could always tell her that you are willing to live by yourself if she covers the difference in rent between living with your friend and living alone\u2026 but even then, that would be at your discretion, not hers.",

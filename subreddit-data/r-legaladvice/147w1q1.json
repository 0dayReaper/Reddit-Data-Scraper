    "postText": "I talked to my lawyer recently and she said that I shouldn't do anything, part time job or even school, until my claim is approved. I'm taking one summer class (online, asynchronous with accommodations) that she suggested I should drop. \n\nWell I just got a job offer for a part time position, but it's through Appen and only a temporary position. No interviews, just an online test I took with no time limit. It's just rating pages and search results, something I can easily do even when in pain. The start date would be June 14th. \n\nMy condition usually has to go to hearing to be approved (but gets approved), and I have no idea how long that would take but I need financial assistance asap. Would it be better to just skip the job offer and pursue this disability case?",

The past three months have been nothing but pain, but I'm starting to enter remission and am not in is much pain when I first applied. but last time my remission only lasted a month before the pain started again. 3 months on, one month of seems to be a pattern.\n\ni felt like I was starting to be able to do things to get my life back together and now having to drop it all if I want to pursue disability. it's difficult, I feel extremely overwhelmed and I have nobody to talk to about it. i still can't hold a normal position and I don't think I'll get the opportunity for a job like this again. \n\nand everyone in my family looking down on me for pursuing disability in the first place so I just have no idea what options the right one for me and an on s short time limit to make my decision before the appeal window passes.",

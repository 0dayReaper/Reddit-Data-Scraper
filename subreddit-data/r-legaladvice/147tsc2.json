    "postText": "I've been with my current employer a couple of years and I've heard rumors of some shady things they've done to save money but thought nothing of it due to rumors being rumors and not seeing anything first hand. Then we started a new way to do health insurance. Starting March 1st we added this thing called The Difference Card. The way management explained it, we would use our regular Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance to have BCBS cover the initial 20% of the bill, then The Difference Card would cover the remaining 80%. Management said that we would still have to pay our regular co-pays, any lab work not fully covered, and for seeing anyone outside of network. The usual health plan stuff. At the beginning of May I was informed that all of the doctor visits I had been going to were something I was going to have to pay out of pocket for until I reached the $5,500 deductible. I pulled up the paperwork given to us by management that did not say anything of the sorts, and checked the work website for benefits coverage and that also did not say this. I spent a week going back and forth between BCBS and TDC and every time no one knew what was going on and kept pointing fingers at the other company. I finally started emailing our HR/Benefits lady who immediately told me I was wrong and didn't understand how to use insurance. When I responded I sent screenshots of everything the insurance websites said versus what our company documents said. She ignored me for a week. I emailed her again asking for an update about my insurance. I pointed out that I was paying $400 a month for benefits I could not use until I paid an additional $5,500 for the year to get a \"free\" $500 from TDC. I asked again (sorry my email title was \"Please cancel my insuracne) to cancel my insurance and get reimbursed for the money that has been taken out of my checks for benefits I cannot use. She emailed back saying everything was fixed. I called BCBS and TDC and found out everything was still the same. I emailed our Benefits lady and told her that nothing had been fixed and to please cancel my insurance and reimburse me due to the amount I'd pay to insurance this year would be 29% of my income just for them to give me $500 for free. (side note, 9 of the people I work with are on the exact same benefits tier as I am and have not had a single problem) Last week she emailed saying, \"I was just about to cancel your insurance when the manager from TDC called and gave me some good news. Can she call you?\" Our benefits lady did not say what the good news was, the manager from TDC said nothing on their end had been changed and now our benefits lady is ghosting me and refusing to return my calls or emails on getting my insurance cancelled and reimbursed for the money they've taken out of my checks for benefits I cannot use. Is this legal? What do I do next?",

            "comment": "This \"Difference Card\" sounds like some sort of HSA/FSA that gets loaded with $500 from your employer that can be used to offset medical bills.\n\nEverything else sounds like relatively normal Health Insurance (albeit with a pretty high deductible). Did you receive EOB's from BCBS regarding these appointments? They should explain any discounts that are being given.",

                    "comment": "Yes my current EOB's for the 8 doctor visits I've had all show that BCBS is not covering anything even when they're supposed to be covering 20%. Also I am the only one on this benefit tier having this problem which is why our benefits lady spent a few emails treating me like I was stupid since no one else is having to pay an additional $5500 to use their insurance. One other person in our clinic is having an issue with their spouse that they are paying to be on the insurance and is unable to use it but the main account holder is using it just fine.",

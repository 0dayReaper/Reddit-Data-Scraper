    "postText": "I recently quit my food industry job after putting up with my racist manager for two years. In my letter of resignation, I noted the several racist comments shes made as well as the xenophobic, classist, homophobic stuff she has mentioned. I intend on sending it to corporate since she has been going around trying to tell coworkers and the district manager that I have been making up lies about her, even though I had 7 other people add their own experiences that led to them all quitting along with me. I\u2019m not too familiar with the law in Texas regarding defamation, but since I am sending the letter to corporate of the company I had worked out, there\u2019s no legal grounds she can sue, right?",

While the truth would be your defense, you would be called to provide it in court. \n\nHopefully, these are all things you and your former co-workers have already been reporting to corporate all along.",

    "postText": "Not sure if I'll get any luck here but looking for so e guidance. \n\nLong story short I got a full knee replacement in the NHS last August due to my medical condition (Haemophilia B). \n\nWhile the joint is better in terms of I'm no longer in pain everyday while trying to walk, the issue I am having is with the movement. \n\nMy leg bleed really badly after the surgery meaning I could not move or stretch it. The physio could barely do any work with me. As such my range of movement is stuck at 6- 97\u00b0. I had full range of movement pre surgery. \n\nNow I know there has been mistakes made. They lost my blood clotting medication post surgery and I had to argue with them to go find it. The leg should not have swelled as much as it did even with my condition. Lots of other things like ignoring infection in wound etc\nI went in for manipulation in December to see if this would help but it made me worse. \n\nSo basically I'm left with a knee that won't fully straighten and can't bend as much as it should post surgery (I was told I should get to about 120-130\u00b0)\n\nI want to know if there are any options available to me as speaking to some people who have had similar problems they have suggested I look into it. \n\nOther than a GDPR request of all my medical files pre and post surgery I wouldn't know where to start. Any suggestions or similar experiences would be appreciated.",

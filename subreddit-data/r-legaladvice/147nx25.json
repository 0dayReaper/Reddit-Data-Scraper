I think past is past and\n\nWhat he didn't apply in the past, I think he shouldn't apply retroactively now.\n\nIs it true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you reside in a rent-stabilized apartment, by law your landlord cannot increase your rent beyond a certain percentage anyways. Specifically, each year the NYC Rent Guideline Board sets a cap on how much a landlord may increase your rent annually. In June of 2022, the board set a 3.25% increase for one-year lease agreements and a 5% increase for a two-year lease agreement.",

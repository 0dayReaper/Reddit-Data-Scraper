    "postText": "I invested in a company to manage an investment for me. The simple terms are: Every month this investment makes a profit, 15% would go to the management company.  The company would send me an invoice for that amount and I would pay it. \n\nI payed all invoices I received.  \n\nAs of April 30, this company went out of business and I, for the time being am left to manage the investment myself. I found out recently that a 3rd party has bought  some of the accounts receviable from the company that went out of business.\n\nMy main question is does this only apply to money what was owed to the original company up to April 30, or does this apply to future profits  I may make?

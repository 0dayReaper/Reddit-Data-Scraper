    "postText": "I have a laptop with the highest support warranty available. My laptop has stopped working and Dell refuses to replace my laptop without the original Invoice. The invoice is in the email of my Grandpa who died 3 years ago. Dell says it is a requirement to have the invoice to issue a replacement, however in their user agreement this is not stated. \n\nI have offered to provide all information that would be on the invoice to confirm. I also have the Laptop registered under my name on Dell and have had all service requests under my name dating back to 2021 (Laptop was bought August 2020)\n\nShould they be bound to replace and uphold their end of the agreement?\n\n\n[User Agreement](https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/legal_docs/dell-premium-support-plus-sd-en.pdf)",

            "comment": "Stating the obvious, but can you reverse engineer the invoice from whatever distributor/reseller you purchased from, so [Dell.com](https://Dell.com), Best Buy, Micro Center, Amazon, whatever? For me, I don't tend to keep invoices per se, but when required I pull them up from my Amazon account or whatever else. (on the flip side, I do of course realize you may have purchased from a brick-and-mortar store and not kept the receipt/invoice and without an online link to the same like Micro Center does, for instance)\n\nLong shot here, but is there any chance they can call up the serial number somehow on their end? I have found that Samsung and Apple have warranty check features on their websites that can at least provide basic info on warranty status and eligibility/remaining time on first-party warranty coverage.",

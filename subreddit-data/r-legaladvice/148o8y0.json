    "postText": "I send an email to my landlord and asked if I can early terminate the lease. But she seems to be really upset and replied : \\`\\`\\` You actually have already breached the lease by moving your parents in without getting consent from me. I would prefer that you vacate the house by June 30. I will demand that you pay two months rent to buy out the remaining lease term. \\`\\`\\`When she saw my in-laws in the house, she didn't say anything. Now suddenly she brought this up. I think she wants to get an excuse to let us move out. My in-laws visited us after we moved in the rented house and will stay for 5 months.  Can I get a reason to defend ourselves properly? We just need some extra days to prepare and find a new place.",

            "comment": "&gt;My in-laws visited us after we moved in the rented house and will stay for 5 months.\n\nThat is definitely a violation of the prohibition on guests staying for more than 14 days.   Your landlord \"noticing\" them and not saying anything at first doesn't mean she cannot enforce the lease later.\n\nIf your landlord wants to end your tenancy on the basis of that violation, they generally need to give you a \"cure or quit\" notice specifying the breach you've made, and giving you a specific period of time to fix it.   In California, such a notice must follow [a general written form](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/eviction-tenant/notice-types) and give at least 3 days for the tenant to fix the problem.\n\nIn your case, that \"cure\" of the violation would be moving your in-laws out of the house.\n\n&gt;I would prefer that you vacate the house by June 30. \n\nThat line in an e-mail is not sufficient to terminate your tenancy, or support a court petition for eviction.  It is not sufficient to be a \"cure or quit\" notice.   It doesn't include your full name, the address, a description of the violation, and the specific 3 day time period.\n\n&gt;I will demand that you pay two months rent to buy out the remaining lease term.\n\nIf she wants to end your tenancy, then she can't demand future rent.\n\nIf you want to end your tenancy, then your landlord has a \"duty to mitigate damages\".   Her offer to allow you to \"buy out the lease\" for the value of two month's rent is just her first offer in a negotiation.   You would only owe her the actual unpaid rent during the time that the property was empty and no rent was being paid.\n\n&gt;Can I get a reason to defend ourselves properly? \n\nHer notices are deficient and she can't go to court without giving you a 3-day (or more) notice to cure or quit.   Or, you can prove that you have cured the violation by moving your in-laws out.\n\n&gt;We just need some extra days to prepare and find a new place.\n\nUntil your landlord actually gives you a written notice to cure or quit, and you fail to do so, you have the right to remain tenants.",

How long do you want to stay ?   Can your in-laws move out promptly, or do you plan to live with them in the future ?",

If they never give you a written cure-or-quit notice, and never file for eviction, then their recourse will be to make a claim on your security deposit and/or sue you for unpaid rent after you move and stop paying.\n\nI think it would be better for you both if you agreed to pay a smaller amount of money in return for their agreement to allow your in-laws to stay, and for you to move out on an agreed-upon date.\n\nThat requires a grown-up negotiation.\n\nIf you and your landlord can't discuss this civilly, you might be able to make use of one of the [mediation services](https://www.scscourt.org/court_divisions/civil/adr/searchadr/adr_home.shtml) that the County's courts use to try to resolve disputes without litigation or trials.",

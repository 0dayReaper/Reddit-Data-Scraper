I\u2019m not going to go into why but I want to know how to be emancipated in Minnesota as there\u2019s no form to fill out, and if I was emancipated would I still get survivors benefits from my mothers death?",

            "comment": "Not a lawyer so take this with a grain of salt but I believe you would have to before a judge prove your father unfit to parent due to his age and your mother unfit to parent sue to her medical conditions. You would also need to prove you\u2019re able to independently financially support yourself. If both those criteria are met, you may get granted emancipation. However, if the judge rules you incapable of independently supporting yourself, you may get thrown into the foster care system until you\u2019re 18. The judge may also make their decision based upon whether or not you\u2019d be able to finish out high school or not on your own. Again though, I\u2019m not a lawyer, if considering emancipation, you\u2019re best bet is to find a local lawyer specializing in family law, one may find your case compelling and take it on pro bono or at a reduced rate if you get lucky given your age.",

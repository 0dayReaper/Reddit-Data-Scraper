    "postText": "  On mobile so apologies for formatting. I\u2019m not sure what type of lawyer I need but as far as I can tell I\u2019m dealing with a private nuisance lawsuit. I\u2019m also unsure if there\u2019s actually any hope at all but I\u2019m desperate. I\u2019ll try to give any information that I think is necessary to the situation.\n  \n  We are located in Massachusetts. Our house is on a corner lot so our backyard looks into our neighbor\u2019s yard. They have always been loud and obnoxious but recently it has felt like retaliation. We had a fence dispute a couple years ago where we had a property stake out completed which revealed their existing wooden fence was two plus feet on our property. They threatened us with an adverse possession lawsuit but we knew they couldn\u2019t really afford it. Anyways, they also have an above ground pool and a pool deck that were not permitted (and are still not) that they agreed to move so that our new fence could be installed. \n  \n  Months pass, our fence goes in, the pool and pool deck haven\u2019t moved and they are doing some sort of construction inside (surprisingly not permitted). In addition to this they are letting their big dogs bark at us from the pool deck and jump into our new fence separating vinyl panels while I\u2019m in my backyard with my young son. So now I\u2019m upset and my husband sends a letter to the building inspector regarding the pool, pool deck and dogs. The inspector comes out and talks to them and they move the pool to the required setback and move the pool deck ten feet from our property line. \n  \n  They are unbearably loud. If it isn\u2019t the T.V. blaring from their deck off their house it\u2019s the radio in the yard and if it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a speaker blaring from the pool deck. A couple weeks ago we finally had to call the cops for a noise complaint THREE times in one day and while my husband was on the phone with dispatch our neighbor\u2019s son who\u2019s twenty six yelled to my husband \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here you f***ing pussy\u201d in front of our four year old son. It has been eight years of putting up with them and I\u2019m tired. A couple nights ago I was watering our newly planted trees and she jumped up on our fence and pulled herself up to look over because she didn\u2019t know what that noise was. She had been drinking but who does that?\n  \n  I don\u2019t know what to do. We just put a deck on our house and did a lot of work to our yard  (including adding privacy trees that will take some time to grow still) and I feel like we can\u2019t even enjoy it. We bought a decibel reader which I know we need to be careful when using as to not get their voices recorded without their knowledge of us recording them. We spoke briefly with an attorney that takes private nuisance cases and are waiting to hear back. \n  \n  What can I do to start building a case? Am I looking for a Real Estate Attorney that does litigation? We have other things that we could report them for. Like cutting down trees in the conservation land behind our houses. And their son has a shed he was at one time growing weed in that drains into that conservation land. He\u2019s also detailing cars as a business at their house.\n  \n  I don\u2019t even care to sue them for money (they don\u2019t have any anyways) I just want them to be respectful and turn their shit down so that we can enjoy our own backyard. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",

After all the whole point of this is that they are so loud that you can hear them from your private property next door. You can argue that they cannot have any expectation of privacy since you have already told them you can hear them.",

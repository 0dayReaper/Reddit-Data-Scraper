    "postText": "In December of 2022, I had to go to a rehab for a couple months and I asked my good friends (at the time) if they could watch my dog for 3 months until I\u2019m back, they said yes of course no problem take your time etc\u2026 to make a veryyyyy long story short, they have been refusing to give her back, and refusing to even let me see her now since March when I returned back. How do I go about starting an arbitration case on them to get my dog back? P.s. I live in San Diego California and I can\u2019t find any information anywhere online for my area stating how I would start the case ? Please and thank you I appreciate all.\n\nEdit: IM NOT LOOKING FOR A SMALL CLAIMS CASE, IN SMALL CLAIMS I CAN ONLY DEMAND MONEY I BELIEVE, I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN CIVIL, IN CIVIL I AM ABLE TO DEMAND MY PUPPY BACK.",

    "postText": "Not sure what my legal option are here if any, but could use some help! \n\nLast week (Monday 5th June) I received a phone call from a lady who works for the witness care team. She said she was calling me about the case that's in court next week. I said I had no idea what she was talking about. She said a letter had been sent to me on 26th March notifying me that I would need to attend to give evidence. I told her I hadn't received any letter. Upon further investigation, I asked them to send me the letter via email and it had been sent to a local grocery store they believed I worked at, however I had never worked at the address. \n\nMy statement for this incident was taken at the workplace it happened at last year, so they knew I was not working at said grocery store as the police came to my work! \n\nTherefore, this was the first I was hearing of this case. \n\nI know giving evidence is a requirement but honestly I am petrified. I already suffer with anxiety (now classed as a disability) so not having time to prepare for this has really thrown me. I just have no idea how this could have happened. I also had to communicate with my work (I am now in a new job) as I have to be available all this week, as they do not know when I will be needed. \n\nThe letter states that I should contact them to say I have received the letter within 7 days, I obviously did not do this as I hadn't received it. They did not follow up. I confirmed with them that they had my correct email address and telephone number, so they could have followed up that way.\n\nWhat are my legal options here if any? Or is it just a case of it being a clerical error and there is nothing I can do? \n\nThank you.",

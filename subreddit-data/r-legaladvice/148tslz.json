    "postText": "I ordered a laptop on fiance through dell last year it never arrived i filed a police report per their instructions but they refused to cancel the charge and they are now suing me to collect the initial balance + interest. Do i have to pay this if i really never got it ? I am in Georgia USA and cannot afford to pay this or afford a lawyer so advising me to retain one is not helpful. The amount is $2000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni got a letter in the mail saying i could just make it go away if i file bankruptcy should i just do that if i dont own anything?",

    "postText": "I got into a car accident last September which I was injured and hired a lawyer to sue the party at fault. I\u2019ve never hired a lawyer before or been in any legal trouble so the process was all new to me and I went with the first one I found on Google, essentially. I called and gave them the details of the accident and then they sent this random man (an independent contractor) to physically come to my home and have me sign a bunch of paper work (that had no letterhead, just said The Law Group, up at the top), that included giving him my social security number to collect the medical paperwork from the care I had been seeking. After I signed the paperwork, I didn\u2019t hear back for almost 3 months and in that time did some digging on the office and found that the name of the person they gave me had their license revoked for some time a few years back for malpractice. They also gave me no email to contact, I only had a 1-800 number and no extension. I also never actually talked to any lawyer that would\u2019ve been representing me, it was always an assistant of some sort.\n\nAnyway, I hear from them by the end of January but by that time I\u2019m still seeking medical treatment for my injury and they told me to reach back out when that is done. It\u2019s June and I\u2019m done with treatment, but I also haven\u2019t heard from them at all. The last time I called into my insurance they did say they couldn\u2019t talk to me without my lawyer so I do at least know they\u2019ve reached out to insurance.\n\nI\u2019m sketched out by this law group and was wondering if I can just hire someone different without reaching out to the original ones I hired?",

At that point,  they will gather your bills and records and send a demand to the insurance company. Everything you described seems pretty par for the course.",

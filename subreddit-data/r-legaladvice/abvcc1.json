    "postText": "North Carolina: Lyft has pictures of his stained car with food strewn about. Looks like possible throw up, but in now way was caused by us. Also some of the throw up was on the seat we were sitting directly on...\n\nHis car was already a mess when he arrived. We would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. We were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later I was charged $100. What can or should I do?\n\nUpdate: Lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. Also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver \u201cRoy\u201d (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... Who the fuck is Roy and where is my fucking money! \n\nLooking in to get the info behind the photos. Still no reply from Lyft. Used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.\n\nWill update soon with photos .",

I read an article about a woman who did that and got her money back, BUT Lyft banned her from using their service. ",

Keep reiterating that there was no way you could have made the mess and tell Lyft to look at the time stamps of the photographs. I did this and Uber basically told me tough luck. If they do this to you, tell them that they should contact the driver because you have their license plate info (I said this but really didn\u2019t have it) and you will be filing a police report against the driver and Lyft. When I said this, Uber replied to me in less than a minute saying my money would be refunded.",

I suggested he turn left on a street and I meet him there, and he started cussing me out. Because he'd fought me so long, Uber tried to say it was my fault for \"waiting so long to cancel.\"",

I decided it was in my best interest to cancel. Disputed the cancel fee and they auto refunded the fee. I assume if you dispute it often they\u2019ll actually start reviewing why you\u2019re cancelling. \n\nYesterday I almost didn\u2019t get into an Uber after seeing the tires nearly bald, after getting in I wish I didn\u2019t since it had a bad wheel bearing groaning and some wheel balance problems. I sent Uber a note about this today, we will see what they say. They should really be making everyone\u2019s car get inspected every 6 months. ",

Now, this was near the Strip in Vegas, the night before New Years Eve, so it was rather crowded. \n\nBut she also honked at a car near our house which wasn't near the strip. \n\nAt one point (on the strip) she even warned us - When this light turns green I'm going to honk because it's a short light and I want to make sure we make it. We made it through the light... but was an \"orange\" one. \n\nNo kidding - I think she must have honked 7-10 times on the 20-25 minute ride. ",

I was sober at the time with my girl friend and neither of us threw up. What should I do?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n&gt; Lyft has pictures of his stained car with food strewn about. Looks like possible throw up, but in now way was caused by us. Also some of the throw up was on the seat we were sitting directly on...\n&gt; \n&gt; His car was already a mess when he arrived. We would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. We were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later I was charged $100. What can or should I do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

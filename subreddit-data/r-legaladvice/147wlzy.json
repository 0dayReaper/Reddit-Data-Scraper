    "postText": "Ok I know nothing about renting laws, also I'm a idiot teenager but I think it's ridiculous the way my mom is getting treated by her landlord, and we don't have access to some of the basic things that a house is supposed to have. I don't know if we could take legal action against her and I'm not sure how renting laws work in Michigan.\n\nSo let me break it down. Here's three of the basic things that have pissed me off.\n\nMy mom and dad recently divorced, and my mom rented a house from some lady she met through her work. Let me tell you all the problems that it has: \n\n1. Water doesn't work correctly, the pipes that connect the water are old and damaged so we've had two instances where the house has been flooded and it took them 6 months to send people out to fix it.\n\n2. Landlord told my mom that they were turning off the gas to the house, when my mom tried to bring up the fact that she has her children living there, the landlord stated that \"Don't use your kids as a pawn\" like gas isn't essential to a home.\n\n3. Landlord showed up to the house that my mom IS RENTING FROM HER, and tried to enter in the code to the door. Thankfully my mom had the bottom lock since she had the keys to the house. She showed up because my mom had complained that they hadn't fixed anything and were treating her like shit, which is entirely true. \n\nI don't know if this is even enough to take legal action against them since we are renting from them, I just joined this subreddit so that way I could see if there was anything My mom and dad (because my dad has stated that this is unbelievable that she is being treated this way)",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m moving to Washington and applied for an apartment. The leasing agent emailed me back saying I was the very first applicant (in Washington they have a \u201cfirst come first serve\u201d law for applying to apartments) and if we would like to move forward with paying the holding fee or signing the lease so it\u2019s taken off the market, since it would take a few days for a check to arrive. We said yes, and she said that the lease could be in effect by the next day at 5pm. The next day we reached out to to the agent to send us the info on how to pay the holding fee and how to sign the lease. They said they already had another tenant that applied before us, paid the holding fee, and signed the lease so we couldn\u2019t get the apartment. Even though they told us we were the only applicants and told us we would be able to sign the lease immediately. Hours later, they finally tell us that someone else (that currently lives at the building) already applied and signed the lease. Is that legal to do?\n\nAfter we asked how to set up the lease portal, she said: \n\u201cLet\u2019s be in touch via email to see if maybe I have some thing else. It looks like a current tenant that was moving out of a studio did application for his girlfriend and made payment for an immediate start date but I\u2019m still working out the details I should know by end of day.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, I followed up and said \u201cI thought you said we were the only applicants?\u201d \n\nTo which she said:\n\u201cFirst non tenants \nThat\u2019s where it got turkey when a current tenant has already been approved and qualified, and applied placed money on the unit which leaves someone from out of state at a disadvantage\nI should know in another hour or two but yes, if a current tenant who\u2019s already been approved and applied places a fee with an agreed-upon start date and a sign the lease, they would be ahead of someone from out of state, who had an opportunity to show proof that they mailed a holding fee Which the information was given yesterday so it\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s just first come first serve\u201d. \n\nI followed up at the end of the day and she said \u201cLet\u2019s touch base via email tomorrow but yes, a current resident hopped in and because he had already applied. He made payment and signed a lease so he technically got the first availability since he was the first person who made payment we can email tomorrow I might I have some thing else that would fit your needs and I can always use your same application on a different unit or a different building. Very close by. I manage about 25 buildings all in the general location.\u201d\n\nIs this allowed?? Everything was in place, and she even verbatim said that we were the first and only applicants. This sucks \ud83e\udd72",

            "comment": "Nothing here seems illegal. She is probably well within the law to straight up lie to you about how many applicants there are. She also never made you any promise, in fact she told you quite clearly that to take this unit off the market you needed to pay a holding fee or sign a lease. She didn't say \"If you ask for some instructions on how to pay to pay the holding fee we can take it off the market\". Honestly even if she did, with virtually no consideration for her part it would be hard to argue that this is a binding contract.\n\nIt sucks, but not everything that sucks is illegal.",

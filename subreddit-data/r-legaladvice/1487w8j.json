    "postText": "#CONTEXT\nNot sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but we had a close friend and roommate move in recently so we could help them out. They have chronic health problems that prevented their higher education, which keeps them in lower-earning jobs, which means crap insurance, which means big bills and continuing health issues... Rinse, repeat. \n\nThey landed a decent job recently, but it's still taxing and what they really want is to go back to school so they can earn a degree that lets them work from home (or at least get a job where they can sit and avoid strain). \n\nThe main issue is insurance. Thejr job gets them insurance through United, which is decent. But because of health problems they don't have much saved up and haven't been able to work much, so if they quit (or, god forbid, lose the job) they'll be forced to use Medicaid, which is NOT comprehensive enough for their medical needs. \n\n#TL;DR / THE ASK\nIs there a way for my spouse and I to include our friend as just part of our household so they aren't forced into Medicaid due to low income? \n\nWe know we can claim them as a dependant on next year's taxes (they started living with us midway through last year) but that's not necessarily useful in the timeframe - and it may be a bit demeaning.\n\nIs there anything that can take effect sooner?\n\nLocation: Oregon",

            "comment": "Nope. There's nothing you can do here. You can't do anything to include your friend in your household that would change their insurance situation. You cant add them to your own employer plan or marketplace plan and they can't use your income in order to qualify for subsidies on marketplace health plans.",

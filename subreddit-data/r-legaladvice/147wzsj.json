    "postText": "Im based in the UK and I went into an IVA in Feb 2018, recently found out that in Feb 2019 one of my creditors that had agreed to being in the IVA had filed for a CCJ against name. (only found out recently by getting my credit score / report) \n\nI never knew about this as they knew they couldn\u2019t file anything legal or binding because of the IVA so they didn\u2019t carry it forward to a bailiff or similar. They are saying they will write the CCJ as settled as I have closed my IVA now but they won\u2019t remove it, as too much times passed. (i would have dealt with it, had I known / if i was allowed to contact them) \n\nTo my understanding they cannot give me a CCJ while i\u2019m in a IVA with them so should remove this as should never have been allowed to be added in the first place. \n\nany help appreciated?",

    "postText": "Here's a link to the original post. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&amp;sh=7f56780f\n\n\nMy sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. \nThe guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. \nHe is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. \n\nEnds up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he \"feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.\"\n\nThe neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. \n\nWe've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. \n\nOur lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  \n\nShe was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. \nOne from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. \n\nOne for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. \n\nHer lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. \n\nShe finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, \"laughable\" and we refused the settlement offers. \n\nOur lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.\n\nNow for some extra facts. \n\nMy left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. \n\nOur dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. \n\nThe destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  \n\nThe day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  \n\nWe called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. \n\nOur lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. \n\nThe video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. \n\nWe also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. \n\nHe said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. \n\nThere was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. \n\nI honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. \n\nEither way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. \n\nThank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. \n\nI'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can. \n",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

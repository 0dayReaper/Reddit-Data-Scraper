    "postText": "Hello Legal Advice, I have found myself in quite the conundrum.\n\nA year and a half ago my mom unexpectedly passed away with no will or estate plan available. Her and my stepfather lived in Dallas where he currently resides. He paid the funeral expenses with the life insurance that was paid out after her death.\n\nHe has been getting ready to try and sell the house since it is too much to afford on just his salary, and has started the process to be the executor of my mother's estate, and his lawyer has reached out to have us sign waivers for his application.\n\nHe has previously said that he  wanted to take the proceeds of the house and put it into a trust of equal parts for my brother, myself and our stepsibling, that would be paid out upon his death. My mother never adopted our step sibling. I expressed to him that my brother and I do not want that to happen.\n\nAfter hearing this he stated that the house renovations and the cost of the funeral would be coming out of the estate, split between us three. I am fine with the renovations for the house coming out, as that is how houses are normally sold, however I feel like retroactively charging us for half of the funeral expenses isn't correct.\n\nHis lawyer also said that we couldn't put contingencies in the waiver my brother and I sign for him to be executor or independent administrator of the estate. \n\nMy questions are as follows: can he retroactively charge us for the funeral out of the proceeds for the sale of the house, and two, are we allowed to put protections and contingencies in our waivers for this or am I completely misled.",

And if he were to decide to not sell the house (which is his right, if he can afford it) then he'd get to live in it for life. You'd need to maintain it, and then once he dies, you and your brother would inherit it in full.",

This might wind up being the difference between you getting 1/4 of the value of the property now, or 1/3 of the value later.  \n\n&gt;can he retroactively charge us for the funeral out of the proceeds for the sale of the house\n\nThe estate can pay for the funeral before the inheritance is split.  Whether the proceeds from the sale of the house count as the estate is a question for a lawyer. Squabbling over him paying for her funeral out of his portion vs all of you splitting the cost out of the entire estate is probably not going to go too far; you may eat more in attorney's fees than the funeral cost.\n\n&gt;are we allowed to put protections and contingencies in our waivers for this\n\nWhat sort of \"protections and contingencies\"?  This is just the waiver saying you're okay with him being executor, correct?\n\nThis is sort of starting to hit the point of deciding how invested you are in this fight.  If you're determined to stand your ground, you may want to talk to a lawyer of your own; however, doing that and getting into a legal battle could wind up costing quite a bit of money.  Probate attorneys rarely work on contingency, and in a protracted fight over an estate it's not unheard of for the people involved to wind up paying more for their lawyers than they inherited.  That's not to say you should give up any rights or anything you're entitled to, just warning you that  it's possible for everyone (but the lawyers) to lose in this situation.",

            "comment": "It's not about you agreeing or not. The estate has to be probated according to Texas law. Nobody is charged with anything, only the estate is charged. With the law being followed, no one has to agree to anything.\n\nThe proceeds of the house are to be used to pay off estate debts first, and taxes, and whatnot. Once everything has gone through the proper process, then the remaining proceeds are divided thusly:\n\n1. He keeps 1/2 of the community property, 1/3 of her separate personal property, and the right to use her real estate for life. Sounds like the latter isn't applicable here.\n\n2. Children from her and another father inherit everything 2/3 of her separate property, including a 1/2 interest in the community property.\n\nIn effect, *everyone* who stands to inherit is \"charged\" for the funeral expenses, but that's not really how it works. Or not at all how it works. Funeral expenses come from estate funds prior to the 1/3, 2/3 and 1/2 are calculated. The step sibling doesn't inherit. This is more holistic than you or he are viewing it as. Presumably his lawyer will let him know. No, you can't add these types of things to the paperwork, they wouldn't be applicable either.\n\nSorry for your loss.",

It's not his choice. His lawyer should let him know that.\n\n&gt; I'm not sure what prevents him from doing whatever with it.\n\nPretty much, the law does. Being executor/administrator is not about having the power to do whatever you want, it's about having the responsibility to follow the process and the law. You can bring up with the attorney that you'll take your inheritance in check form, when the time comes (could be a year or more, not uncommon). Good luck!",

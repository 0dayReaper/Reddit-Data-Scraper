    "postText": "Sorry for formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nPretty much the title. Back in November of last year, I rented a car to drive from Washington state to texas as part of a move. I extended my rental for one day as I needed to do some car shopping after I got to texas. On the day I needed to turn the keys in, the place was closed so I turned the keys into the drop box. To my dismay, later on that night, car thieves stole the keys from the drop box as well as the keys to several other cars but only mine was stolen. This rental company continued to try to charge me every single day for the car not being turned in saying, \u201chow do we know you didn\u2019t steal the car?\u201d and \u201cthe contract on the car is still open until we have the keys in hand.\u201d Well, me being in the military figured this was an issue to bring up to my chain of command. My NCO brought me to the rental place and raised hell on my behalf and for that I am grateful. I got the company to close the contract and drop charges and they recovered the vehicle. The matter was closed. Or so I thought. I just recently got a letter from the company stating I owe 9760 USD in damages done to the car. About 8500 in damages, a diminution of value for 1150 and a service fee of 150. What can I do? I\u2019m in TX.",

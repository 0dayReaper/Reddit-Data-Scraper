    "postText": "Hello,\nI am in NYC, and I have a question regarding child support. So I am legally married to my sons mom. We have been separated for almost 7 years. We have a great relationship and we do parent well. We have a even split of time with our son. Some days she gets 4/7 days of the week some times I get 4/7 so it\u2019s works and we have a great co parenting relationship. If we wanted to make it official and get divorced, can we opt out of child support just because we both do everything equally and financially it\u2019s never been a burden. She is a great mother and I am a great present father but living in NY is expensive and we both do what we can. She has stated she wouldn\u2019t accept child support and we have discussed it all. Is opting out a thing? I\u2019m skeptical because of how fathers are viewed in society and if I am going to ultimately get screwed I rather stay married until he is of age. Help",

    "postText": "So basically an old credit card debt of mine was sold to a debt collector and they sued me for it. We settled in court for around 3k. The debt was originally around 5k. Ive been paying $164 a month for almost a year and a half but there is still a remaining balance of $1,317. My question is, can i offer to pay like $500-$700 to settle it now and be done? (Yes, I know now that i could have originally fought it but i didnt know i had that option at the time)",

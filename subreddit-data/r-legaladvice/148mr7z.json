I worked as a residential designer for a very famous designer locally. I was paid salaried. \nI read that it is illegal. I already filed a wage claim with the state 3 weeks after the time that I should of received my paycheck. It has been more 8 weeks that I filed the claim with the state. Is there anything else I can do at this time? Please advise. Thank you for your help.",

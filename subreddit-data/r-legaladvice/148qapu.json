    "postText": "Hi there,   \nI\u2019ve been wondering about this for a while. In September of 2021, in Sacramento California, I booked a room through a well known site, for a month. The owner did say upfront, no refunds. However, after checking in, I had what I now know was an allergic reaction. I felt like I was sick: my eyes were red, my throat was sore, and my nose was completely stuffed up. It was unlivable. I was struggling to breathe. In addition, loud arguing at night and overall miserable, but that\u2019s just how it goes. But long story short, I panicked and left. I spoke with the company, and they said I was out of luck. I didn\u2019t stand up for myself at the time, and the owner didn\u2019t refund me a penny, despite that I\u2019d only been there one night and paid for 29 more nights. I know some of that is on me, but I\u2019ve always wondered, any point looking into legal recourse? Anything I can do at this point? If not, I understand, and will chalk it up to lesson learned, but losing $1000 just never sat right with me. Thanks!",

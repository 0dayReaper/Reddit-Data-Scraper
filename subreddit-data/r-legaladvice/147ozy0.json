    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI(18M) was on my way to school today driving through my town. I was getting close to an intersection with two lanes, I was turning right, the biker(50s M) was taking up a good amount of space in the lane but still barely enough for me to be in the right turning lane. I signaled to go right, made my turn, made sure it was slightly wider since there was a biker in between me and the road. The biker just went straight into the rear of my car at like 15 mph, no damage to my car. It honestly took me a second to realize he hit my car but once I did I turned around and came back to see if he was ok. The guy is claiming that he was going left and that I should be at fault. He took a picture of my plate. He then asked for a picture of my id which I refused to give, I said a name and number would be enough(i gave him my name and number he didnt give his but I found it out when he called me to check if the number I gave was legit), he repeatedly threatened to pull me out of the car and \u201cbeat me up\u201d and \u201ckill\u201d me if I didnt give him more info. Neither of us called the police, no report filed, he biked away from the scene. \n\nThe guy had 1 visible scrape on his elbow.\n\nWhat should I do? I live in a fairly affluent town in fairfield county ct, people sue each other over spilled coffee, should I be worried?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not entirely clear, but it sounds like you failed to yield the right of way to him. Pedal bikes are generally considered to operate within the same parameters as motor vehicles, and as such you need to observe the same principles you would with other cars around them. Not saying he should have threatened you, but he was likely upset that you drove in such an aggressive manner (yes, around a pedal biker that sounds like relatively aggressive rather than defensive driving).  If he has injuries or damages he can quantify he can certainly sue you, and file a police report post incident.",

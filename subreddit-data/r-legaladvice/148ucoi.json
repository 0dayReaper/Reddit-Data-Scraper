    "postText": "Edited to add we're in Florida\n\nI'm sorry this is long but I want to make sure I am not overreacting before I look further into this process. My husband needed paperwork to renew his DOT physical card for a new job next week. He has been working with the VA to get in with his primary doctor who prescribed the medications in question and went to see her in person at 7am this morning. The paperwork that was filled out at this appointment states:\n\n\\-The purpose of the paperwork and FMCSA statutes regarding the medications and what they are looking for \"...Side effects such as sedation or dizziness...\"\n\n\\-Have there been any side effects from the medication that would impair the driver's ability? **Answered NO**\n\n\\-Asks to list all medications and dosages: Answered to see attached list; No known prescriptions from outside providers\n\n\\-Asks to list medical reasons for medication-Answers Listed on med list\n\n\\-Does driver have any restrictions-**Listed physical impairments, nothing related to medications and side effects**\n\n\\-It is then stated: It is my medical opinion that, considering the mental and physical requirements of operating a CMV and with awareness of a CMV driver's role (consistent with driver's role statement on this page) my patient 1. has no side effects from medications that I prescribe that would adversely affect the ability to safely operate a CMV **X-AGREE** 2. has no medical conditions that I am treating that would adversely affect the ability to safely operate a CMV **X-AGREE**\n\nMy husband found out 1 hour later that the paperwork was not the right paperwork, he called and was told to come to the walk in clinic for an appt at 1130 am, 4 hours after the first appointment. Upon arrival my husband was told that his appointment was cancelled, that they will fill out the paperwork and fax it over when they get to it. My husband has been waiting to start working based off of this appointment and didn't understand why no one called to tell him they cancelled an appt they just made. He explained his situation about needing employment and waiting on the new correct paperwork, he said he could wait for it to be done so he could get a copy. The lady told him it may not be done today, he then went and talked with the patient advocate and the Chief as his provider had been giving him the run around for 2 weeks on getting the first paper filled out, he can't wait another 2 weeks for her to then say he needs to make another appointment. They told him that they would ensure his doctor did the paperwork today by her last appointment at 230pm and they would fax and give him the copies for his records. My husband waited there until around 430 for his papers, written by the same doctor, on the same day, who was well aware she was filling out the papers so he could start working and was obviously informed that his paperwork needed to be filled out today as well. These are her answers on the **NEW** paperwork:\n\n\\-Once again refers to medication list (unchanged since appointment at 7am that day)\n\n\\-Does the driver have any restrictions or limitations? - **Do not drive if \"X\" causes drowsiness. Do not drive if \"Y\" causes drowsiness.**\n\n\\- It is my medical opinion that, considering the mental and physical requirements of operating a CMV and with awareness of a CMV driver's role (consistent with driver's role statement on this page) my patient (**prior) &lt;-she handwrote that in on this one** 1. has no side effects from medications that I prescribe that would adversely affect the ability to safely operate a CMV X-**I DISAGREE** 2. has no medical conditions that I am treating that would adversely affect the ability to safely operate a CMV X-**I DISAGREE.**\n\n\\-She then wrote in-between open spaces: **Prior patient, he has been reassigned. The medication could adversely affect his ability to drive if it causes drowsiness. If additional information is needed he will need to make a new appointment with his new primary.**\n\nAm I crazy or is this not right? How can the same medications cause no adverse side effects at 730 am and you clearly state in your professional opinion that your patient can safely operate a CMV, but by 430pm those same medications cause enough concern that your professional opinion changes causing him to not be able to be employed? Just for the record, my husband had zero contact with her after his initial appointment that morning, all concerns were voiced to the patient advocate who asked the Chief to help ensure his paperwork got taken care of that same day.\n\nIF YOU GOT THIS FAR THANK YOU!!!",

First thing tomorrow morning I would be getting ahold of your point person at the VA, fax copies of the first paper work and the second explaining it was literally hours in between and asking why he was reassigned? It kinda sounds like her boss got on her to get it done and she was being petty.",

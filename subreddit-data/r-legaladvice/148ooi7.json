    "postText": "Happened in Florida last night. He is supposed to be picking up my son in 40 minutes. I've emailed all of these details to my lawyer last night and left a voicemail a half an hour ago, but she hasn't responded, yet. I understand that can be typical but I'm starting to feel desperate.\n\nHe lives in Washington and is here for less than one week visit our 18-month-old son in the evenings. It has been 4 months since his last visit. We moved here in December. Divorce is not filed. There is no formal parenting plan in place. I only hired my lawyer on June 7.\n\nIn earlier text messages this week Ex stated that he would be leaving every day at 9pm while he was visiting here.\n\nEx was here at my apartment this evening, and we had just finished dinner.\n\nAt 6:48pm my mom called and asked me if I would go with her to my cousin's house to drop off a gift my mom got for her.\n\nI wrapped up work, and picked her up at her house at 7:07pm and we arrived at my cousin's around 7:35pm.\n\nI was at my cousin's spending time, with her &amp; her husband, their two kids, her husband's parents, and my mom.\n\nI texted Ex at 8:24pm, since it was close to time to leave, that I would like to stay later. I gave him some time to respond.He did not respond. At 8:32pm I called him and he answered.\n\nI said I was having a great time and didn't get a chance to hang out with my cousin very often like this and would appreciate being able to stay out. He said he was going to leave right at 9 whether I was there or not. I asked what he would do with Baby and he said that he would put him to bed and leave. I clarified and he confirmed that he meant he would leave Baby in the unlocked apartment - he doesn't have a key. I told him I might be five minutes late because I had to stop to get gas and drop my mom off. He said he would leave Baby in bed and the door unlocked, and that he would leave right at 9. I told him he couldn't leave our child unattended and I was coming home now. He said, \"You are making that choice. This is my boundary and I am enforcing my boundary.\" He hung up on me. The phone call lasted 2 minutes. I left by 8:35pm.\n\nI stopped to get gas and only put $10 in. My guess was that was enough to get me home without wasting too much time. I was extremely distraught and believed that he would leave Baby alone if I was not home.\n\nAfter getting gas, my GPS said I would arrive at 9:02pm. At 8:52pm I called him and he did not answer.\n\nI left a voicemail stating my GPS said I would arrive at 9:02 and if he left Baby alone in the apartment I would call the police on him.\n\nI did not drop my mom off, even though she only lives 5 minutes away from my apartment. I arrived at the apartment at 9:01pm and he was in bed with Baby, who was asleep. He did not know my mom was here. I told him he could leave. I asked him to leave 11 times. He stayed in place, motioning for me to be quiet because Baby was sleeping. He started trying to tell me to calm down. He did not move to get out of my bed at all. I said we can have this conversation outside the room but he needed to get off my bed now. He refused to move. He had the lights on in the bedroom. Baby has never gone to bed with the lights on. I believe this whole scene was staged by Ex.\n\nI told him to get out of my bed. 11 times I asked him to leave before I started getting louder. I was afraid because he's become physical before with me and he wasn't getting out of my bed after insisting on leaving right at 9, even if it meant leaving his 18 month old alone. I was getting scared because I cannot physically remove him from my apartment myself. He kept motioning that Baby was sleeping and I should be quiet. But he made no effort to get out of my bed.\n\nWhen I became loud, he took out his phone and started recording me, still not removing himself from my apartment, or even my bed. I started screaming at him to get out of my house and Baby started waking up.\n\nEx pointed the camera at Baby, to get his token shot of the innocent baby. I believe he was trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage.\n\nHe denied saying that he was going to leave Baby here alone. I did not misunderstand him. He said he would, multiple times, and said it would be my fault. I did not misunderstand anything. My mother heard the phone call as well. I know what he said. He has implemented gaslighting to emotionally control me for three years. I've learned to recognize it, and this was what he was doing to me now.\n\nMy mom walked into the room, and Ex was pretending to be cowering from me with his camera pointed at me. I kept telling him to leave. Finally when he saw my mom was here he started to get up.\n\nHe was moving slowly and not really leaving so I took Baby into the room to comfort him. My mother stayed in the living room until Ex was gone and she locked the door. She stayed with me. I went to the gas station to get Baby some milk, and he went back to bed.\n\nAfter he arrived back at his AirBnb be sent me the texts saying it was a misunderstanding (he denies ever saying he would leave Baby home alone) and I chose not to respond to his texts. The problem is solved. But he is lying. He did say that he would leave our 18 month old alone in the apartment if I didn't arrive back exactly on time.\n\nI was so afraid that his threats were serious and that he intended to leave our child in a home alone, or that he would become violent with me when I asked him to leave. I am afraid of how far it might have gone if my mom wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAnd I believe he did this to stage a scene, which is why he had the lights on in the room. He purposely threatened me, using our child's wellbeing to get a reaction out of me. He didn\u2019t give me any time to calm down. Instead I had to drive home in a hurry. He's been trying to instigate a reaction out of me for two weeks, escalating in his behavior, since I came to Washington on June 1 to June 5 to collect my sentimental items from our marital home and sell my other belongings. He couldn\u2019t get to me by threatening anything else so far. So he resorted to using his child to get to me.\n\nMy question is this: Can I refused him further visitation until I hear back from my attorney? I am afraid of him. I am afraid our child is not safe alone with him and I do not feel safe enough to be alone with him and our child to supervise.",

That means you don't have to give the child over.\n\n**HOWEVER**, if a case has been filed it's very common to have a temporary order in place.  You need to be very sure with your attorney that no order exists.",

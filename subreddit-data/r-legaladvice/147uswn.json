    "postText": "I am currently enrolled in an online university in pursuit of a masters in software development. I've finished all but 3 courses of the program with a 3.953 GPA. My final 3 courses remaining are 2 technical courses and a capstone. \n\nThe last course I attempted I was forced to withdraw from. The coursework was 9 years out of date. The process for doing the activities involved, in this case coding up a mobile app, had been changed so much that following the videos we were given as instructions resulted in nothing but broken code. The software we were meant to use had changed so much that absolutely nothing worked, and because of the course's tight 8 week schedule there simply wasn't time for me to go elsewhere and teach myself. \n\nI withdrew from that class, but because the first week had gone by I was not allowed to be refunded for the course. I was forced to pay full price, and I switched to the other technical class I needed. Since the previous one was the kind whose subject can vary I was hoping that a second attempt later on would have more up to date instructional videos that I could learn from.\n\nI am now 5 weeks into the second class I need and I have hit the same problem. This one is supposed to be on DevOps, and focuses heavily on using Amazon Web Services to create cloud based servers with various structures using command line functions. We are told to just copy the code in the instructional videos. There are almost no explanations of why we do something or what the parts mean. This class has such outdated instructional videos (by at least 5 years based on the software changes) that literally not a single week's work has been updated enough to actually work. The things we've been told to copy are not even close to working anymore. The AMIs we are told to use no longer exist. The creation wizards for the EC2 Instances and VPCs are nowhere close to the same. \n\nDespite being over halfway done with the class, I have learned nothing except how to copy broken code. I've spent well over 8 hours a day trying to fix things only to get maybe one line of code functional. If not for assistance from another student who is also having the same amount of trouble as me, I would not have gotten this far. I have barely scraped by with managing to get this software working usually the night it is due.\n\nI have however finally hit a wall. Nothing I do will make the provided method work. The lack of explanations of everything means I can't even diagnose the problem. Because I am over halfway through the course I will yet again be denied a refund. \n\nMore importantly, the fact that their courses have been so outdated as to be utterly worthless is going to mean I cannot graduate from this program.  \n\nIs there anything legally that could be done to at least get my spending thus far refunded? I have had to take out loans because I don't have any other income. It's a lot of debt that I wouldn't have minded if I had a fair chance at actually getting something out of it, but they seem to have deliberately set it up for failure. It's impossible to know it is so outdated in the first week unless you already know the material the course is covering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

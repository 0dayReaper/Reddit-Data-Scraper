I tried to grab it on the passenger floor and my car rolled into the car in front of me. I gave all the infos and everything and I asked if she was going to file. She said that it was nothing and that she couldn\u2019t even see anything. Lets just go on our way. I said ok and now I get a letter for bodily harm and damages. Am I actually liable for all of that? Yes I am stupid.",

Something else? \n\n&gt;when she said it was fine\n\nThere is nothing wrong, unless she signed a release perhaps, with her deciding it isn't fine.  Or realizing that she's injured in a way she didn't realize they're at the scene of the accident.  \n\nThis is why you have auto insurance.  Let them do their job.",

You are not obligated to pay anything until a court finds in their favor.\n\nYou were likely obligated to report the accident to your insurance, so you may want to get ahead of that in case she does sue. \n\nBy the sound of it, you are very much at fault, but she is trying to milk the situation.",

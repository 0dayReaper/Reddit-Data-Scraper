    "postText": "Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d5p1oh/my_bank_put_my_account_under_another_account_and/\n\nI submitted an OCC complaint against my bank the same day I posted, about 2 weeks later the bank called me and asked me what day works for me and I would be meeting their National Enterprise Financial Crimes Director himself at my local branch or if I did not want to come in they would come to my house even after business hours.\n\nThe next week I go in and meet him, he does nothing but apologizes for about 20 minutes and tells me they will immediately cut me a check and or give me cash for the missing funds that were transferred to the \"mistakenly approved parent account\". I quote that phrase because he said it exactly like that about 20 times.\n\nI tell him great, I'll take cash since I have already opened a new account elsewhere and do not intend to continue to use their services since it took me reporting them to a government agency before they did anything at all to fix the situation that was clearly their fault. \n\nHe tells me that's fine and he understands but he just needs me to sign a \"small document\" saying the situation has been remedied to my satisfaction, the \"small document\" is about 20 pages of stuff that I understand about half of but I can kind of see it's basically me saying that I am being refunded the money and I can take no legal action against them, can not talk about it and cannot tell anyone their mistake. Also that I must remove all \"public postings, mentions, anything negative about the bank from any online reviews or websites publically accessible\". Seems they found my reddit post.\n\nHe tells me that I cannot receive my money unless I sign this. I tell him definitely not since I cannot understand half of this and I leave without my money. So I once again file another OCC complaint online and call in to speak to someone. They tell me this is being escalated and to wait to hear from them, about a week later the bank is once again calling me for a meeting. I tell them I want nothing except a check mailed to my address on record and to leave me alone otherwise.\n\nAfter a few calls a check finally showed up, for the full amount that was transferred to the parent account. Thanks LA for telling me about the OCC (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). They take complaints seriously and it's what it took to finally get this whole thing resolved.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.97 23/269ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

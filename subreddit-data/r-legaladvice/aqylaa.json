    "postText": "Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEx had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to \"lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her.\" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the \"secret mommy promised to make her keep\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using \"Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick.\" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you.",

Lot of ways it can be shown. \n\nAny of these could be obtained through the courts if it came to that, and the doctor or an informed medical assistant/secretary should be willing to testify (I imagine they\u2019d take fake medical records and children\u2019s health pretty seriously).

However, one detail stuck out to me:\n\n&gt; When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case.\n\n**Your ex's decision didn't only endanger your daughter's life. She endangered ALL the children there.** There's a non-zero chance that some of the children there are now infected with chicken pox as well, and depending on their own health, chances are it's even worse for them than your daughter. As you pointed out, your daughter is already hospitalized. *This may directly kill someone.*\n\nMy question for the actual lawyers here: **Can the school take action against the ex? What about the other parents at the school?** I feel like they have a VERY strong case, especially if (and I *really* hope this doesn't happen) someone dies because of the ex's malicious actions. At the very least, it would help the case to get the ex's custody removed.",

I don\u2019t think you need to involve CPS at this time because you are a protective parent, but what I would do is think about talking to the police.  In Texas, not providing medical care to a child that needs it can be considered criminal.   I would not just go to any police department though and bring this up.  In your city, there is probably a Children\u2019s Advocacy Center, and there are trained law enforcement that deal with child abuse housed there (probably, every city does it differently).  I would see if you could talk to a detective at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center or in the specific unit that deals with child abuse, about what happened and see what they think.  They may tell you that this is not a criminal matter but based on what you said \u2013 this person had a clear intent and lied.  You have a doctor stating that they did not give your child immunizations, your child is very sick, and it is a result of the parent lying.  Sounds to me like child endangerment.  Also, it is very important that you get your custody order changed because you have to honor your custody agreement until it is changed.   At some point, not filing for a change in the custody agreement could be seen as not being a protective parent.  I don\u2019t know about in Colorado, but in Texas CPS cannot do much if there is a protective parent.  CPS can only change court orders if both parents are not protective and the child is unsafe in either home.",

Go back to that lawyer with this information and tell him that you want full custody immediately.  If he can file your case with the same judge, you have an excellent chance.  If there's one thing a judge hates more than people who ignore his orders, it's people who actively forge documents in order to ignore his orders.  Particularly if ignoring his orders causes harm to a child.\n\nAlso, take the advice of /u/Overlord1317 here.  You can probably end up with custody and a good chunk of your ex's money to use for your daughter's recovery and future medical bills.\n\nFinally, once you have the emergency custody order, make **sure** the hospital knows about it, and that your ex is **not** to take your daughter under any circumstances.",

At the very least have this stay billed to your ex\u2019s insurance.\n5) maybe also get a TRO on your ex due to child neglect and safety concerns.

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "(TN) Husband and I bought a new car in April. We were told everything went through and left with the car. A couple weeks later, the dealership calls us to let us know they gave us the wrong form and we need to complete the correct one. They harassed us for two days before showing up at my husbands job demanding he sign. Husband chewed out the manager for doing that. After we looked over the paperwork and confirmed it was the wrong form, we signed the new one. \n\nAs of two weeks ago, I hadn't gotten any info on the loan so I called the bank. They can see it's being processed but to call the dealership for more information. I call the dealership and they said everything is done and the bank should get it soon.\n\nToday, I get a text from the dealership saying they messed up the bank paperwork and need us to come back to fix it before the loan can be issued. It's been almost 2 months since we got the car. \n\nAt this point I'm super suspicious and not sure what to do. Do we hire a lawyer?",

            "comment": "&gt;We were told everything went through\n\nIt sounds like you did an ordinary Retail Installment Sales Contract where you authorized the dealership to assign your loan application to a lender they regularly do business with.   This is often also called a \"conditional sale\", because it's conditional on the loan being approved at the amount/interest/term that you agreed to.   The interest rate (expressed as APR) and the amount financed and the sale price are always in bold-bordered boxes on the front page of that contract, called the Truth In Lending Act (TILA) disclosures.\n\n&gt;we looked over the paperwork and confirmed it was the wrong form\n\nIn fairness, it's hard to do paperwork when you're coked to the gills.\n\nI'm genuinely curious about what form could have been different.   Did they use the arbitration version and not intend to  ?  A version for a lease instead of a sale ?\n\n&gt;need us to come  back and fix it before the loan can be issued\n\nSome states allow a dealer to write a \"seller's right to cancel\" into the contract, which gives them a number of days to finalize the financing and the right to cancel the sale if they cannot do so.\n\nSometimes that's because they screw up a submission or form.   Sometimes it's because the bank changes their eligibility requirements or participation, or the buyer's credit report comes back different than expected.\n\nAnd sometimes it's because they're pulling a swindle of some kind.   Usually it's a higher interest rate, or a higher price or fee.  Sometimes they're even just trying to push a sale into a different calendar month for quota or commission reasons.\n\nIn Tennessee, there's no specific time limit (like the 10 days in California, or 4 days in Washington).   Instead, it's a requirement of their auto dealer license under [TN Code \u00a755-17-114\\(4\\)\\(A\\)\\(iii\\)](https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-55-motor-and-other-vehicles/tn-code-sect-55-17-114.html#:~:text=\\(-,iii,-\\)%E2%80%82Allow%20the%20consumer) that they must:\n\n&gt;Allow the consumer to void the motor vehicle transaction if any of the terms of the transaction change after the consumer has approved and accepted the terms\n\nYou can cancel the sale and return the car, or agree to the new terms being offered by the dealer.  \n\nIf you choose to agree to the new terms, you should read the contract very carefully.  I would even take a highlighter and set out the old and new contracts side-by-side and compare them (no matter how impatient the salesman is).",

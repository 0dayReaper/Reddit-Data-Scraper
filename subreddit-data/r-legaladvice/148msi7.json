    "postText": "ETA - I've already spoken to laywers all over the state and over state lines. IDAHO - Best summary I can give. April 2021 my mother called me at work  and asked if I left the house the night before, I said no, and she said the police were looking for me. I called the police. I was being blamed for three felonies by a business in a small town. Supposedly they had seen the person leaving the place at 3am as they showed up. Said it was a girl with dark makeup eyes (I rarely wear makeup and now don't anymore), blonde hair (I've never had blonde hair in my life), tall and skinny (both of which I am not). The person's daughter showed them a picture of me, and the woman said it was me 100% and she would die on the stand for it. I had nothing to do with anything. Never had an issue with these people. Officer came by my house that night. Had me try on clothing that was found in a trash bin down the street from the business; gave the clothing to my mother to hold, and others. I found blonde hair in the hat, told officer, they said they missed that. Came back later for DNA swab and fingerprints. Never officially charged. Officer told me they were keeping it off the court books so I wouldn't be in trouble. None of it made sense. I had witnesses (two) of me being home. Officer keeps texting me. I'm paranoid. Go to get vehicle from mechanic with my mother; following her home I see owner of business and flip her off. She's friends with cop; I get a citation later that day for being an unsafe driver. A week later, driving with friend, a girl flips me off associated with the business, I do the same back, I get two citations a week later from the same cop for swearing at a minor (come to find out, she didn't have a license, was driving by herself, and was three months off her 18th birthday, but she didn't get in trouble for the driving). The business has verbally told people it's me, but I couldn't get proof. A few months pass, I have to give another set of fingerprints. Still haven't found anyone else that could be the suspect. There was someone who thought they might have heard a rumor of who had done the crimes, and I told the cop, and he texted me and said I needed to throw my friends under the bus so he could find the people who committed the crime. But they didn't want anything to do with the cops, and rather than follow up on my tip, he wouldn't do anything because I wouldn't tell him my person. October more rumors around town. I text the four involved (the two owners, the person who saw the suspect, and their adult daughter) and said they were aholes and I'd see them in court. Then the one owner gets on facebook and publicly posts saying my full name, where i live, and that i committed the three felonies. Over 45 people in town comment; they say I'm not welcome here, that I better pack my stuff, they're gonna run me out of town, etc. I've still never gone anywhere in town by myself; always paired up. I get four more citations that night for disturbing the peace (for texting them that I would see them in court) - the same cop gave me the tickets, and said that it should have been for threatening a witness but the prosecutor wouldn't let him put that. Also been going through a toxic divorce and custody battle and the ex used all the felony and court citations to say I was an unsafe mother contributing to him getting full custody of my son, which I'm still fighting in general. I was called by the cop late November 2021 saying it wasn't me, there was DNA for two or three other people found. No apology, nothing. And the business never said it wasn't me. The town still assumes it was me years later. I still can't get a job in town, I get harassed, I don't trust the cops or the emts. The only cop to be involved with the whole issue isn't a cop anymore (he had other issues on other cases that he was doing things illegally) but has taken over the position in town with the emts from one of the owners of the business. It's coming up on my statute of limitations in a few months. Idaho is a per se state that automatically awards a win to people that have been slandered or libeled about crimes. This has ruined jobs, my record (which was clean before any of this), my relationship with my son, etc. I need help with how to deal with this. I know some basic court things, but this isn't what I got my degrees in. Please and thank you.",

    "postText": "I am a tipped server at a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. All of the tipped employees take part in a tip pool which is split 75% FOH and 25% BOH. I have only been employed here for a few weeks, and when I asked how we could find out how much we make in tips a night, my coworker told me that the company has a rule that says they can't share what we make every night \"as that would be going against the law of discussing the pay of other employees.\" according to the company, if they share our nightly tipout, that's considered discussing pay.\n\nI'm definitely going to ask my employer directly, but in the meantime, if this really is how they do it, a) talking about pay isn't illegal, b) I'm only trying to find out what I personally made, and c) how am I, the employee, supposed to know that the company is accurately reporting my tips and paying me accordingly? how would I find out if they happened to be stealing from me?\n\nthis all seems rather backwards to me coming from a job where we pooled and were given our cash tips every night. \n\nthanks!",

            "comment": "So the rule on pay discussion is illegal\n\nAssuming you are an employee who is eligible to unionize, and you appear to be, then discussion of wages is protected by the NLRA.  So long as the discussion doesn\u2019t actively stop your work it is a violation of the NLRA to have a policy that prohibits discussion of wages or to take/threaten to take an adverse tangible employment action against employees for discussing wages.  Complaints of this kind are filed with the NLRB and if the company is found to be in violation will result in a sanction of some kind against the company (generally something like requiring them to post a sign saying they won\u2019t do it again) and potential back pay for any employee who has been improperly terminated or disciplined.  \n\nGo to your boss and tell them you need to know what you are getting tipped. If you want to get aggressive you can tell them they have an illegal policy, but keep in mind that even if it would be illegal to fire you for complaining about that, they might do it or otherwise put you on the shit list.",

    "postText": "So I received a traffic ticket for not keeping my registration up to date. I was unable to pay to renew my registration, the taxes on the vehicle, and the ticket before the court date. \n\nAs such I decided to pay the ticket fines first. I called the court, they said after the day listed at the court date, I would have one week to pay and if I didn't show it would just be a no contest. \n\nHowever, I never appeared on the docket and the ticket was never listed as payable on the county website. \n\nI now have come into some money to get my bills sorted out in regards to registration fees, taxes, and the fines. But I am unsure of how to go about that. \n\nI'm unsure of if I need to call a lawyer, what kind of lawyer I would even need to call, or if o could just pay this all off. \n\nThis is in South Carolina. \n\nSo I guess my questions are like what could happen to me and what kind of lawyer should I call?",

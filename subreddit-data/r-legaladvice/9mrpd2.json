    "postText": "This is in north Texas. \n\nHey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \n\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \n\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026 \n\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \n\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \n\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\n\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \n\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \n\nThe next day he came over to \u201cCheck on me\u201d and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \n\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \n\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \n\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \n\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \n",

I will happily answer any questions about bed bugs. \n\nMy first bit of advice is for you to get professional treatment of the bed bugs. It is not cheap, but they are incredibly difficult to get rid of. Bed bugs can survive a year or more without feeding and do cause a wide array of psychological issues due to prolonged extremely poor sleep. I sincerely hope this is the cause of your issues, but I would also talk to your doctor (not your boyfriend) about your symptoms. Request bloodwork. \n",

Those fuckers get into wood, they get into damn near well everything.\n\nIf you are the victim of a long term infestation, EVERYTHING needs to go.  All your wooden/pressboard(ikea type) furniture. Your clothes and bedding need to be nuked in super hot water. Anything you have that shouldn't be washed that way can be dry cleaned, I believe this kills them as well.  Mattresses gone, carpet, everything.\n\nThese motherfuckers are hell to get rid of once they have dug in. They can get into drywall. We had to dispose of a great deal of wooden furniture, have several walls replaced, towels, bedding, mattresses - all gone. Then had the exterminators in.  And we didn't get them the first time. We had to come back over everything again.  Now those fuckers are gone. Fuck them!",

Check in the little creases for brown specs or encrusted brown flakes. \n\nThese symptoms sounds eerily famaliar to what happened to a friend of mine. We thought he was going crazy. Turns out he was having a severe reaction to long term bedbug bites. \n\nYou mentioned that you remember everything that hapoened at his place but as soon as you got home it started up again?\n\nBedbugs can cause psychological symptoms if the reaction is severe enough. \n\nI would check the lip of the mattress first to see if you have bedbugs.

IF you plan on going to a family members house, put all of your clothes in a dryer on high heat. If you have a lot, a laundromat might be cheaper. You will have to pretty much quarantine your bedroom. Everything will need to be looked at, I mean everything. Bedbugs are a nightmare to get rid of and they can be anywhere. Check your house as well, use a flashlight, check creases. Everything. I\u2019d also suggest you check your vehicle too. They can travel with you and you may not even know it. I\u2019ve had to deal with this and it sucked. They tend to stick to one spot though, mostly where you reside at and only really come out at night. ",

If it is, she can choose not to pursue rape charges, because none likely happened (and I'd expect she wouldn't, or at least shouldn't, be able to win the case if it is bedbugs). If it isn't, though, she has a rape kit in evidence so she can move on to investigating what she sees as the second-most likely option. That way, she can investigate the bedbugs possibility at her own pace, without the fear that it'll take so long that she'll be unable to follow up on the rape possibility.\n\nNow, is it *likely* he's a rapist? Probably not. That being said, it is still a possibility, and quietly getting evidence alone isn't a legal or social accusation of anything.",

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

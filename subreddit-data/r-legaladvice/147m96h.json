    "postText": "Builders scratched glasses/doors when installing - Legal options?\n\nMy builders have scratched my glass on windows and internal doors. There is a retention fund, of which is kept back for defects should there be any issues. Our architect (who works with him regularly so has some bias) has said that the scratches only count if visible from minimum of 2 metres and not within 50mm band of the edge of the glass. She is essentially trying to minimise how much he has to remedy. \n\nMy understanding from looking online is that the guidance she is quoting is for newly installed glass from the supplier themselves. Not for damage caused secondarily. \n\nAnother company provided the internal doors which have been scratched), our builder supplied two windows which his cleaner has also scratched.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be strong armed by the architect to minimise what he has to resolve. \n\nDo I have any legal options?",

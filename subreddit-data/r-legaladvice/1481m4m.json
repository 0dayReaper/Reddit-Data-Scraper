Police came today and evicted me until the court date where I\u2019ll see if it becomes final or not. Is this process gonna cause me to lose my house completely or am I safe on the deed? This is happening in PA btw.",

What kind of attorney depends on the missing information here, but might start with a criminal defense attorney and end with a real estate (or divorce) attorney.",

You have a couple of things to resolve and one or more things working not in your favor. An attorney can help you navigate the path forward as carefully and as appropriately as possible, to whatever outcome you hope to achieve.\n\nGood luck.",

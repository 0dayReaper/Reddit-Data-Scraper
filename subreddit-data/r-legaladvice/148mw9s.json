    "postText": "Hi folks! I'm not sure if this is a question for attorneys, accountants, or both. I'm a US resident and I was wondering if it's legal for me to work remotely for a company outside of the US. Would I need to pay taxes in both countries? I am struggling to find a job here and wondering if I should start applying for jobs outside of the US.",

But that company would need to be properly set up to comply with US employment/tax laws if you were to work here.",

However, you have to pay your primary tax in one country only as the benefits from that country would apply to you. You should seek proper advice as it is tricky and believe me when I say. The tax bunch all talk with each other.",

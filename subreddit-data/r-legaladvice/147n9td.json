    "postText": "Hello! im a full-time barista in Toronto, ON working at a small business for 11 months now.  im planning on leaving due to a toxic work environment, but it\u2019s come to my attention that my boss hasn\u2019t paid me (or other employees) any of the tips we received. \n\nHe claimed he was using them for paid breaks, but I worked 8 hours with no breaks and ultimately a few months later when i brought this situation up again, he admitted that he hasn\u2019t been dividing the tips among us at all.\n\nIs this legal? I know there\u2019s no way to backtrack to cash tips from 11 months ago but surely credit card tips? And do I have the right for him to go back, calculate, and pay me them now? \nThanks in advance!",

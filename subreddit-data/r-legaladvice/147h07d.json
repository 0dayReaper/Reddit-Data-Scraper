    "postText": "\n\nThe property manager and I got into an argument days before my move in date . After moving in, I was falsely accused of violating my lease. I contacted the property manager and she told me I received a violation because my neighbor told her someone has been in my apartment since I moved in. ( I was only in my apartment for 5 days) I was accused of having someone whose not on my lease staying with me. She said that she investigated before she gave the violation to me. She said that she seen the guy walk into my apartment ONCE and that was her so called investigation. I denied everything and she told me that she would keep it noted in my folder that I had an unauthorized guest. I felt that this was not okay and shouldn\u2019t be noted at all because I did nothing wrong. I thought this was unfair and I called the vice president of operations and explained everything to her. The next day I received a private call from the property manager. During the call she threatened that since I was trying to get her in trouble she was going to keep the lease violation in my file. She also left 100 dollar balance on my account on purpose. She charged me $75 for prorated rent I already paid and $25 for trash that didn\u2019t belong to me. Is any of this considered illegal retaliation?",

They also lied and said my guest left trash in the parking lot which is why I got charged 25 dollars. I honestly think  that she has them watching who comes in and out of my apartment for her. I fear that they will keep accusing me of things that I didn\u2019t do, so I\u2019ve started documenting everything they\u2019ve been doing. Btw the trash that they accused me of leaving was actually one of the two downstairs neighbors.",

    "postText": "I'll give you this backstory so that you can understand the situation. \n\nThe situation is this: My father has recently passed away unexpectedly. He leaves behind his parents and my siblings. The youngest of my brother is 13 and his mother passed away a few years ago (we didn't have the same mom). He has been under the care of my grandparents since and they have just recently gotten guardianship of him. My brother didn't want this because he and my grandparents don't get along well at all. There's a lot of vitriol there that I won't get into. \n\nIn any case, I was supposed to be adopting him once this school year ends so that he would have the summer to adjust to a new home with my family. My grandmother, knowing this was the case went ahead and got guardianship all of a sudden. It's not a secret that she doesn't want him to move out, but me and the rest of our family think it's for the best due to her being very sick (life threatening) and because of the very toxic dynamic in the home at the moment. \n\nIf it comes down to it, does she have the power to say no to the adoption? I know that children must consent, but does she now have to consent as well due to her legal guardianship? Thank you in advance.",

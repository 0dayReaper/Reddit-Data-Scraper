    "postText": "Hopefully this is an ok place to ask this, tried on the guard sub but not really any advice.\n\nOn my bonus addendum document for enlisting, it states that 9 loans, totaling around $67,000 would be used with my $50,000 Student Loan Repayment for the MOS (job) I chose. This is the total amount of my loans and the parent plus loans taken out by my dad for my degree. My recruiter told me he spoke with someone higher-up to get them all submitted, since he was having trouble with the parent plus ones. He clearly got them submitted because my bonus addendum contract states the $67,000. I know they say not to trust recruiters and all, but it's in writing on the contract, didn't really question it after that. I understand the 50k gets taxed and would be more like 35k.\n\nNow, the incentive manager for my state emailed me, telling me \"the parent plus loans I initially signed up with do not qualify for repayment\" and that she was emailing me as a courtesy to update me. I would not have chosen the MOS I did had I known the loan repayment would be this much lower (even after taxes), I would've chosen a job that is more related to my civilian career. The job I have is one of the crappiest in the army with no skills related to my civilian career, pretty much no transferrable skills at all, and with my ASVAB score, I could've done any other job, especially one with a lower promised student loan repayment, like the amount they're saying they'll pay me now. It's an $8,000 difference in loan repayment now, which is a pretty big deal to me.\n\nIs this a breach of my contract? Wouldn't this be a mistake made by people processing my documents, or my recruiter? I'm trying to buy a house and go to grad school right now, so any debt repaid is worth it to me. Wondering how I should go about this. Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: here are the actual words in the bonus addendum contract if this helps. Just picked parts that seemed relevant. I have no idea if I get screwed on semantics somewhere here. I did submit mine and the parent plus loans from my dads NSLDS summary for pre-approval and they said everything submitted, as shown by the total dollar amount of loans on this contract.\n\n\"4. I have furnished the following support documents to both the State Incentive/SLRP Manager and the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) Guidance Counselor (GC) and received a pre-approval memo validating eligible loans.\n\n5. I have one or more qualifying and disbursed Title IV Federal loan(s), not in default, at time of enlistment. The loan(s) must be listed on the NSLDS Summary website sheet. State and private loans are not eligible for repayment under the SLRP program.\n\n6. I understand those only those loans (not in default) that have been disbursed prior to or after my date of enlistment may be eligible for repayment under this contractual period. Any loan(s) in default prior to enlistment is not authorized repayment during contractual period. Loan(s) if qualifying become in a default status during the contractual period are not eligible for repayment until rendered into a good status. Payment is not authorized until loan is one year old with service performed.\n\n8. I have (number of loans) 9 disbursed loan(s) existing in the amount of $67629.00 The total amount of repayment for qualifying loan(s) will not exceed $50,000 with annual repayments of 15 percent or $500, whichever is greater, plus accrued interest or as establisted by Law.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand here is the email I received from the incentive manager: \"I am currently submitting your student loan repayment up to NGB for payment, however, after verifying with NGB on policy, the parent loans you initially signed with do not qualify for student loan repayment. All the rest of your loans (those listed in specifically your NSLDS) do qualify and will be paid upon\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

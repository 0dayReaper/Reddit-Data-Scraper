    "postText": "I'm trying to convince a friend to seek help with her mental health, but she is very afraid of losing her job if she is put into an inpatient psychiatric hospital for extended period of time. She works with 6 employees at a very small business and has been there for over a year. Are there any employment protections for such few employees? Can she legally get fired for being in impatient care? \n\nThank you all so much",

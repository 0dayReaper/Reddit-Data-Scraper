    "postText": "So I know phone companies can kind of do whatever they want due to all the contracts and everything, but I was recently in a car accident and I do DoorDash for work and because of this I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to pay my bill on time so I got into support to set up paying it late and the support told me if I paid 20 by the 11th I would have until the 22nd before my service got shut off. Which I thought was weird but I was grateful to get more time, so I paid the 20 dollars on Friday before I was even supposed to and then I still ended up getting my service shut off this morning, I got into contact with support again and they told me I needed to pay the rest in order to get my service back on despite me having screenshots of the conversation saying I needed to pay 20 to extend it to the 22nd, they refused to work with me and the manager even straight up stopped replying to me, is there anything I can do here legally? I feel like telling me to pay the 20 so my service wouldn\u2019t get shut off and then still shutting off my service when I do would be some kind of false advertisement lol or do I just have to suck it up since my bill is technically still \u201clate\u201d and they can do what they want.",

    "postText": "So I was driving home normally when I saw my neighbor reversing out their driveway so they stopped and like normal I decided to go around. Parked in my driveway about 10 seconds later when I see the car followed me and a man screams out the passenger side that I almost hit them amongst other things. Really didn\u2019t wanna argue with some neighbor iv never seen so I tried to see deescalate and then he asks if I I wanna get shot. He then told me he hopes I have cameras and he\u2019d be \u201cback soon\u201d. Not sure what to do now.",

It's up to the jury or a judge to determine whether you are credible enough to overcome reasonable doubt. It's well worth it to continue to pursue this.

Since he BOTH threatened gun violence AND put a timeframe on it \"be back soon\", the threat is absolutely an arrestable offense, however the charge varies based on which state you live in.\n\nAt the very least, report the threat to the police and give as much information as possible. You reporting the crime is enough testimony (as another stated) for it to be prosecuted; from there, he may try and argue that he did not make that threat, but, from that point it will be up to the prosecutor to uncover any additional considerations  that may lend more credibility towards you rather than him.\n\nAlso, by reporting the threat, you may be doing both him and others a good service, as the scare of legal action against him for making the threat is a good deterrent for the behavior in the future. You also protect yourself by creating a record of the threat, and any future threats now have this previous record behind them and will be taken much more seriously. Best wishes and safety to you.",

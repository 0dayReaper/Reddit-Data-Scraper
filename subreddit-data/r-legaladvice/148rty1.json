    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a 27M based in the UK asking for legal advice over a 65M deadbeat abusive dad living in the USA, Missouri and looking for legal advice/lawyer in Missouri.  \n\nTo summarise:\n\n\u2022    He married my mum in their home country.\n\u2022    Used her to get citizenship (He lives in the US. We live in the UK) \n\u2022    Used the UK Indefinite leave to remain (a step before full citizenship) to get access to the US.\n\u2022    When we were living together in the US, he went crazy and threatened to kill my mum, we called the police and were moved into a safe house but never took any legal action.\n\u2022    He took out a restraining order and there was a court hearing, but he never showed up. The judge threw out the case and directed my mum to family court for child support.\n\u2022    The court date came, and my mum was awarded 1,500 (He earned $30,000 a month base salary without taking into freelance work with other companies and over time)\n\u2022    He also had to get me in the UK every other holiday. With a return ticket for me and a ticket for my mum to come and collect me since he was too busy to take me back and I was too young.\n\u2022    During all of this, my mum and I moved back to the UK for more family support and our mental health.\n\u2022    When applying for US citizenship (He remarried an American) there was an issue with how he came into the country. He was then kicked out of the US for a few years and came back using the indefinite stay he got from my mum. He then used his child benefit payments from the UK government to pay for his kids\u2019 school. My half-sibling joined a national-backed trust fund even though they aren\u2019t a citizen and were not born in the UK.\nHe used our address to apply for a national identity number (think social security number) for one of his children to use here without them being a citizen or meeting requirements, to try to get access to the government funded trust fund.\n\u2022    When he was booted out, the child support stopped so my mum tried to mediate to avoid court since he was only there for 2 years as it was a condition he needed to fulfil for his visa.\n\u2022    He never kept up with the monthly Child Support payments. \n\u2022    When he remarried, he was technically still married to my mum as the divorce documents were forged and we have a copy of the forged/fake divorce documents.\n\nTo round up I wanted to find out what route to go since my mum and I are ready to go legal. Since he forged divorce documents, she didn\u2019t get any alimony and over the years, the child support dwindled while he kept climbing the career ladder. He held money over our heads for years and was financially and verbally, emotionally abusive and when we lived with him as a child, he was physically abusive (dragging her across the floor etc.)",

It sounds like the child support order was in the US, Missouri specifically, and Missouri has a 10 year statute of limitations on child support enforcement. To be clear, it's 10 years from last payment on court record or other form of revival of order on court record.",

In 2011, the VA Supreme Court held that Virginia Code 8.01-251 (A) applies a 20-year statute of limitations to each child support payment from the date that each payment is due as expressed by the court order. So any payments that were due less than 20 years ago are still theoretically collectible.\n\nYes, the bigamy you can report to both states but Missouri is probably the one that matters.",

    "postText": "Hello, seeking advice. My child\u2019s father and I have a custody arrangement and visitation schedule through the court. Recently I\u2019ve decided to block him due to continuous verbal abuse. For my own mental health I\u2019ve decided to not contact him during the week until it\u2019s his time to pick up our child, on Friday. This past weekend was his week and he did not show up nor did he contact me. I blocked him again today, Monday, and now he\u2019s reaching out to me from unknown numbers, yet didn\u2019t think to reach out to me when it was his visitation weekend. What can I do to stop this? Speaking with him gives me anxiety and I don\u2019t want to communicate with him when it\u2019s not necessary. Only during pick up and drop off. Also, he never asks about our child during the week, only when I decide to not give him access to me anymore he wants to start asking. He also doesn\u2019t help financially, so he\u2019s behind a lot in child support.",

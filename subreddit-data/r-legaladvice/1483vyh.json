    "postText": "I just would like to get a little advice regarding my daughter\u2019s former employer not giving her the pay she worked for. A little background\u2026She is 23 &amp; worked for a company that contracts to the public school system for Behavioral Support Specialists. These specialists work with kids with behavioral issues. They claimed that there were discrepancies in her time even though her supervisor at the school approved her time.  Her father and I feel that they just used this as a way to let her go and are thinking that they can scare her into not questioning anything.  They told her that they would not pay her until they were finished with their \u2018investigation\u2019. This happened on May 31.  So they already owe her for a month and soon will owe her for another two weeks.  She has called repeatedly to inquire when this investigation would be done but they will not answer her calls.  Of course the mama bear in me wants to go to this office and get some answers but she\u2019s an adult so I have to stay back. We have called our states (NC) Dept. of Labor and filed a complaint with them.  What else can she do? Any information or tips would help greatly!",

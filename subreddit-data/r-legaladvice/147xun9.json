    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI\u2019m a international students in the Netherlands. I moved into a house in 2020, and I\u2019m moving out in the beginning July 2023. When I signed my contract, I was promised by the agency that the house would be clean and fixed (it\u2019s old and thus a lot of things break constantly). The heating in the house hasn\u2019t worked for 2 years, yet when I asked the landlady to fix it I got no response. \nNow, in my contract it says I need to inform the landlady a month of my departure a month before moving out and I did. However, now the agency is asking for more money on the behave of the landlady because they recalculated from 2020-2023 the gas, water and energy. I would pay 150\u20ac every month for that and they are also asking for 2,256\u20ac for the recalculations for the pervious years. I moved in august 2020 and the calculations in the pdf they attached was from February 2020. Also the landlady and her family live in the same building and the house is divided into 2 parts (under the same address) and all the bills are on her name - thus I think they are tricking me into paying more and I can\u2019t really afford it right now so I\u2019m resorting to my last hope hahaha. Thank you!",

But the problem is that this is big house that is divided into 3 apartments and there are no separate counters, to determine who needs to pay what. They made me pay for the whole houses garbage disposal for 2 years for all the tenants (1600\u20ac).",

    "postText": "(NY)I own a repair shop, in 2022 we did a repair ona customers boat replacing a remanufactured transmission, after completing the repair, the customer took the boat and after a few hours of it running the transmission blew causing severe damage to the engine compartment of the boat. I turned it into our insurance who had us do an estimate for the repair which was much higher than the value of the boat. The insurance company settled with the customer paying them out for the value of the boat. \n\nThe boat is 38ft and in our storage yard taking up a dry storage slip. The cost to scrap the boat is about $12,000 due to the labor and chemical waste disposal involved on top of the disposal of the remainder of the boat. The insurance company claims that they were not signed over the title so they feel they are not responsible for scrapping the boat. I feel that its the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to take possession of the title, and salvage the boat. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken with my insurance broker and he believes i do have a case. My two questions are would you concur that my claim is valid, and would it be worth pursuing the case, and if so what kind of attorney should I retain and how can i locate one in my area.",

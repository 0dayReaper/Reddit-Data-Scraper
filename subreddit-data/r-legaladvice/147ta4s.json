    "postText": "My grandmother co-signed for my cousin\u2019s car loan in 2017 and it was repo\u2019d in 2019 when he stopped making payments. He had a payment plan for the balance and stopped making payments on that two months ago. She received papers over the weekend stating that she needs to appear in court in July as Wesbanco is suing her for the amount due. Does she need a lawyer to represent her or is there a way to prevent this from going to court - such as just paying it? She\u2019s mentally disabled and has a hard time processing information so we want to avoid her having to appear.",

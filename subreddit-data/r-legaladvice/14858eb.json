    "postText": "Hi everyone, obvious throwaway, but I\u2019ll try and keep this short. I am in a nightmare and just want some help/opinions. \nI recently went through a restraining order hearing against me (SCarolina) and I strongly feel that my rights were violated during the hearing. I\u2019ll provide short reasonings.\n1. Jurisdiction. I do not live in the state that the RO was filed\n2. Lack of discovery/evidence: no evidence was given to my attorney even though the plaintiff had knowledge for weeks of who was representing me\n3. Evidence used against me was illegal to present: I am a mandated reporter (healthcare) and the plaintiff was forwarded my federally mandated report that I made against him and sent to his HR. In the state, I should have been awarded confidentiality, immunity from retaliation, and anonymity\u2026 I received none. And yes, before anyone asks, I would NEVER lie on a report and no investigation into my claims has been launched.\n4. Evidence used against me (police reports) are blatant lies. Examples include that I harassed the plaintiff AT his place of work, IN his town, etc\u2026. I LIVE 2000 MILES AWAY. \n5. I was intimidated over numerous emails by the plaintiffs lawyer that my career (doctor\u2014 I am currently a MD/PhD student) would be ruined by this RO if I didn\u2019t accept their plea deal (which requested that I state that I lied on the report I submitted about the plaintiff).\n6. The night before my hearing, plaintiff\u2019s lawyer called my lawyer and informed them that I most likely would be getting arrested at court because \u201cI created a fake name and alias to make an additional report about plaintiff\u201d. I NEVER DID THIS. It was terrifying walking into court after this and point #5\n7. They literally used me \u201cangry reacting\u201d to a post on Facebook from the church that the Plaintiff attends as evidence of harassment from me. I found out that the magistrate judge is a youth pastor\u2026 Where? You guessed it.\n\nMy questions for anyone that has taken the time to read through this:\n1. I have a strong case to potentially appeal this decision, yes? \n2. Am I allowed to publicly discuss (with friends, family, etc.) this situation as long as I don\u2019t name the plaintiff? I genuinely want to advocate for people going through similar situations. Using a RO as a gag order is\u2026 disgusting\n3. Is there potential reasoning to sue those that forwarded my mandated report, made in good faith? \n\nI just really need to make sure I\u2019m not over my head before I go into a potential legal battle that will cost me my mental health and whatever savings I have. I would accept an RO if I was truly a POS and at fault, but I am none of those things. I did what I was mandated and recommended to do and was punished by a state. \n\nThanks to those that read this far.",

            "comment": "IANAL. different state but I\u2019m a resident physician and recently had to go through the RO process to an abusive ex who threatened my medical career. in my state you can appeal to the state appeals court within 14 days. I think you have a very strong case to appeal this decision considering where you live 2000 miles away and no evidence of harassment, the church facebook reaction is totally bogus. I bet the appeals court will give a strong look because so few people really appeal these. Regarding #2, I would wait until this is all over. If you do decide to publicly discuss, would have to not share ANY details that could potentially ID the party since it is a healthcare document. #3, no idea. \n\nyou could just let it stand, but I would personally definitely appeal it.",

The plaintiff had their lawyer send unmarked letters to my PhD and MD program. I was forced to discuss private details about my personal life to each program and now I\u2019m worried for potential bias. Awful. I hope things cleared up for you.",

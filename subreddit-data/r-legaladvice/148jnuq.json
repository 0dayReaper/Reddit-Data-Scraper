    "postText": "I wasn't sure which state to put in the title. The property in question is in Oklahoma, I (and most of the other owners) live in Texas. I am considering sending a cease and desist to a debt collector because I am being called at work. My understanding is that this could cause the collector to go ahead and file a suit. Which I'm mostly fine with because I think I'm more or less judgement proof. I don't own anything, on my own at least. A great-grandparent of mine owned some land up in Oklahoma that is split between myself and a bunch of other relatives.  I inherited it directly because both my father and grandmother had already passed when this great-grandparent died. So I am literally talking about a fraction of a fraction of a fraction here. What kind of judgement, if any, could be placed against this property. Is there another way my family might be adversely affected by this that I'm not considering. \n\nThank y'all in advance,",

I could sell my portion to my brother for one dollar if I wanted to and that would be perfectly legal since, as of yet, no one has filed a lawsuit against me? \n\nAlso, followup question. Outside of income from working, I don't have anything non-exempt. I know Texas doesn't do wage garnishments, just bank levies. Are there limits to how much they can take that way? \n\nThank you for your help,",

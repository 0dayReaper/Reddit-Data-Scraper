    "postText": "hi there people of Reddit. I am a 22 year old student and am hoping to tell my story online. I want to help other young girls avoid what I had to go through, and the lasting impact that it has had on my mental health. For context: \nMy boyfriend in high school psychologically, emotionally, and sexually abused me to the point where I felt as if no one would ever understand what I had gone through, as if I would never again be able to find meaning or a sense of self-worth in life. I felt empty and numb and have struggled to find and maintain meaningful friendships, relationships, and even interactions with my own family. I have spent years trying to level out my mental health and have had to wrestle with suicidal thoughts. Meanwhile, he just graduated college, and has been able to move forward from that point with stability. I am in a much better place now, and am taking my power back. I want to share my story to bring awareness to how dangerous these kinds of relationships are, and to bring hope to girls who are either in these relationships or recently leaving them. My ex-boyfriend\u2019s parents however have a lot of money and influence in the community that I grew up in, (pastors of a megachurch) and I want to avoid and legal action that they may try to take against me as I tell my story. I am hoping you all can provide me with some insight as to how I can do this in a meaningful way and also avoid any kind of liability. Thanks!",

That said, it\u2019s not impossible for them to sue you, because anyone can sue for virtually anything that isn\u2019t deemed frivolous. Which means you could possibly still have to defend yourself in court. To that end, try to stick to objective facts that you have evidence of to the maximum extent possible. Back this evidence up in a secure location, for example if you have emails, chat logs, recordings, etc,",

If you are not in USA, you better start a new topic in a legal subreddit for your area.\n\nIn USA, the system makes it very difficult to sue for defamation. Truth is an absolute defense and opinions are not actionable.\n\nMake sure you don't claim untrue or speculative things as facts. Calling someone asshole or scumbag is fine: court will not think that you claimed that they were a disembodied sphincter or a canvas bag of scum taken from a pond. Saying that someone committed a robbery when they in fact didn't could get you in trouble.",

    "postText": "I live and work in Oklahoma. Can my workplace punish me/fire me for discussing wages with my coworkers. I know Oklahoma is a right to work state and an employer can terminate an employee for any reason. Does this include wage discussion between coworkers? If so are those employees covered in anyway under the NLRB? ",

Oklahoma and most of the US is *at will employment* meaning that an employee or employer can terminate employment at any time for any reason that isn't discriminatory (race, religion, etc.).\n\nBut the National Labor Relations Act is federal law that makes it illegal for most employers to prohibit employees who are not supervisors from discussing their wages.\n\nIf an employer takes action against a covered employee for discussing their wages then the employee can [file a complaint](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investigate-charges) with the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov/).",

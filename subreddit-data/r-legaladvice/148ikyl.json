    "postText": "Illinois - we had our new home built over the past couple years.  1st time builders.  We talked to a lot of contractors(5) and settled on one whose price was middle of the road, but more importantly because he had references(one of which I knew personally) that I could validate, and has been building for multiple decades.  \n\nSigned our contract and seemingly got to work.  Since then, we have had every problem in the book accompanied by every excuse.  Delays, poor quality, wrong things or materials, consistently lack of concern for getting the place done.\n\nThe contract stated substantial completion 140 days from start of framing, however ended up being 289 days to what I\u2019m going to say is substantial.  That was last September, still today, we are fighting issues that he just seems to ignore.  Currently, I have found out he didn\u2019t support my floor per the engineered drawing, so I have to try and have him do something about that, then we also noticed in a rainstorm that the entire front porch which is a concrete slab does not drain away from the house, but in fact back toward it in several places.  We\u2019ve had plumbing woes, electrical woes, drywall issues, roof problems\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss here, what can we do.  We intended on this being our forever home but I\u2019m scared to death I\u2019m going to be living with gremlins for the next 50 years.",

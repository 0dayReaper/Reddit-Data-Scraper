    "postText": "I was evicted last year and owe quite a bit. long story short, i couldn't afford to pay off the eviction in time before it hit collections and for them to threaten me with a lien. so i called them to set up a payment arrangement......\n\nthe original balance was 4218.....\n\nthey sent me a letter stating i made payment on the\n$7000 debt that i owe!!!!!! \n\nhow legal is that?",

            "comment": "You'd have to get a breakdown of the current balance and understand whether you get reasonably from $4,218 to $7,000 on the basis of their additions.  \n\nCertainly you owe interest on this balance.  Likely you owe costs of collections and attorneys fees if an attorney is involved.  But without a breakdown of what has been added and the contractual basis of those additions we'd have a hard time speaking directly to it.  That's *a lot* of add.  They'd need good explanation and contractual backing.",

    "postText": "Hello, this is my first legal advice post and I want to clarify a few things. I'm 26M live in Texas. I moved in mid December of 2022 and in the lease says half off first month rent (i.e. January) and a Free 55\" TV after 60 Days of Move in. Great Deal. I signed the lease and move in. There were some problems at the start like them changing the locks and not having the apartment ready but we got over that hill. fast forward to mid February I had not received any notice to pick up or my mail keys . no biggie ill shoot them an email and wait. I wait till mid march and send more emails and call and stop by the leasing office and no one was there during office hours. I finally get my key and was told they are running behind on the TV's and that it will be a couple of weeks. I wait and wait and email and email. Eventually cut to today 6/12/2023 almost 7 months from move in I call in the morning and surprisingly they pick up and I was when my tv will be ready and am told they have to ask and I will get a call back. Surprisingly no call. I get off of work an hour ago 4pm cst and call during office hours and finally get the leasing manager!!! WOW!! Finally someone with some authority. He answered very rudely and I told him everything and he basically said we aren't going to give it to you. and I respond well its on the lease. and he said where on the lease. and I said its on my lease here's my apartment # you can see for yourself since Ur the property manager. and he basically went okay and was waiting for me to hang up I ask if he needs it I can send it. and I ask for his email and name and he begrudgingly replied. He then says he was told they weren't doing that and I responded that its in the lease. I gave up and hung up and sent him the lease. I kept all emails about this in my mailbox and can pull up call logs of the past 3 months.  \n\n\nPS: He recently became Property Manager like in May.",

    "postText": "I was living in Florida when my daughter's mother parentally abducted her to Massachusetts. It was the middle of the pandemic so things were screwy with jurisdiction and residency because there was a travel ban. My lawyer was not exactly competent so I ended up moving to Connecticut to try to fight for my daughter. My daughter's mother overdosed alone at home with my daughter and more than a year after that they finally awarded me custody and removal to the state of Connecticut. This was on January 3rd 2023. Daughter's mother and lawyer just filed a motion to change the guidelines and wording of the agreement. I don't have Mass council anymore because it was moved to Connecticut. Should this still be under the same judge in Mass, and if so, how long until this is fully a Connecticut matter. Thank you in advance.",

So your child, assuming she moved to Connecticut on 1/3, would be a Connecticut resident on 7/3.  In this case, because the judge apparently ordered her to Connecticut, there may be room for an argument that the judge effectively sent this case to Connecticut at that time.  And perhaps an argument by your co-parent that their motion necessarily seeks changes to a Massachusetts agreement and therefore should be heard in Massachusetts.  \n\nHow best to argue this and how it is likely to land is a discussion with your attorney.",

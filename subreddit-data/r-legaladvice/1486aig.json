    "postText": "Neighbor keeps pit bull outside day and night\n\nI\u2019m moving into my friends house with my ten pound dog. He\u2019s a sweet dog who loves other dogs but would never approach one without me approaching it first. The people who live in-front of the house I\u2019m moving into have a big pit bull who they tie a long thin leash to so he can\u2019t go move then twenty feetish from the porch most hours of the day (like 8am-1am.. poor thing tbh). The pitbull acts fine when I am leaving the house and doesn\u2019t bark or anything. But once he sees my dog, who never leaves the yard, he runs full speed at him barking and growling and the only thing holding him back is that thin leash that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to bust out of every time I see him run. Thankfully, we have a fenced in backyard that my dog can go in and the pit bull can\u2019t see him. I never leave my dog outside supervised but I\u2019m scared one day the pitbull could get out and jump our fence if I\u2019m outside with my baby. For the time being I\u2019m not going to let my dog  go in the front yard unless I\u2019m carrying him. \n\nNow since I\u2019m going to be new to the neighborhood, I don\u2019t want to cause any problems, but this dog really does scare me. I live in South Carolina. Is there anything I can do? I don\u2019t want to be scared every time my dog, who loves being outside, steps foot out the door",

You could try talking to the owner(s) in a friendly manner and maybe even offering to buy a more robust leash/harness for their dog if that would make you more comfortable",

    "postText": "In NYC. I have an annoying condo board member complaining about the smell of a grill in my private ground level outdoor space.\n\n\\- The bylaws do not prohibit or mention grills\n\n\\- They are attempting to fine me based on \"objectionable smells\" from the following section:\n\n&gt;*Unit Owners shall not cause or permit any unusual or objectionable odors or substances to be produced upon or to emanate from their Units.*\n\n(1) There is no section of definitions enumerating what constitutes a \"Unit\", and I'm wondering if this is itself reasonably contested.\n\n(2) I've been using this grill for four years without complaint. Other tennants have grills on upper level  (which is against fire codes) and ground level patios and have not been sanctoined. Is there a reasonable argument over latches and or waivers here?\n\nFwiw, I am familiar with the costs and stresses of litigation, and am in fact willing and able to accept them, but I'm trying to get a sense of if I have a reasonable set of arguments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Typically a unit is understood to include the interior space bounded by the perimeter walls creating the enclosure, and condo declarations often then list other items that constitute a unit, such as doors, windows, and so on.\n\nRegardless, if you are not permitted to produce bad smells from your unit, you are probably not allowed to do so from a common area either.",

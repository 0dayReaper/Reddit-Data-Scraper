    "postText": "1 year ago I had a root canal retreated due to infection. Now I have gone to a new endodontist, and they have shown me that the infection is still there and has not changed in the year since and will require an additional treatment. Do I have any options for financial compensation due to the infection remaining the same after my previous treatment?",

Did you go back to the dentist with pain that he failed to identify or treat?  Does your new endodontist say \"this root canal was incompetently performed\"?",

    "postText": "The other party is trying to sue me, even though my insurance company say that the other party is liable 100%. Fyi I parked my car and stopped the engine first, and the other guy tried to park backward and his car damage in the back and my car has a little scratch inside the door by the driver\u2019s side. The claim is closed back in December with the decision that I am not responsible for the damage but the other party hired an attorney. Does anybody have any experience with similar situation?",

Because the insurance company didn't do anything to their car. Yes, your insurance handles this, it's literally what they do.",

That's because you did the wrong(in their eyes) and therefore they sue you.\n\nYou have paid your insurance company to handle things like this, so you give this to your insurance company and they handle it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in Florida. We do not have a written lease agreement, I do have evidence that he hasn\u2019t paid us in about 7 months. \n\nMy husband and I let my father and 3 brothers move in about 2 years ago. They were living in an RV in the middle of summer and we didn\u2019t want that for the kids. \n\nThey were only supposed to be staying for 6 months until my dad made other arrangements. He had prolonged it for multiple reasons and has now stopped paying us completely. \n\nI have no issue with my brothers (20,18 yrs old, the 16 yr old moved out) staying if they want to. It just my dad that I need gone.\n\nDo I need to file a formal eviction to remove him from the household? Can I just put his stuff outside? If I do file an eviction what is the cheapest/quickest way to do so? \n\nI absolutely hate that I have to do this but he\u2019s basically squatting in my home, disrespecting me, my husband, and my house. I\u2019m 2 months pregnant and can\u2019t deal with his abusive outbursts anymore.",

Then you wait for it all to play out in court.",

    "postText": "Sounds like this is an open and shut case but hear me out. \n\nBack story: I was conceived via a one night stand. My birth father did try to be in my life sporadically until the age of 5 but he made very bad choices with drugs. So much so he became schizophrenic and is now in a state mental institution across the country from me. The last I had tracked him down (out of curiosity and to ask about family history) and talked with his state appointed guardian he had said there is no hope for recovery or for him to be on his own. Present tense: I was searching on an unclaimed money website and came across my birth fathers deceased brother\u2019s investment account. He had no wife or children, both parents are deceased therefore leaving his brother (my birth father) and myself as his only living kin. \nSo my question is, do I have a legal right to try to obtain the retirement account since my birth father isn\u2019t of sound mind? If I claimed it would they try to track him down? He has not tried to claim anything this far. I have a child going away to college and one ready to start driving and I fear the state he is in would just absorb the money if it went to him when my children and I could really use it. Any advice is welcome. Ty.",

Once he dies, then his heirs can look into it. (This is your legal father?)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure what type of legal issue this could be, I\u2019m assuming consumer but I\u2019m technically not a customer, I\u2019m an unwilling \u201cmember\u201d of a co-op and have no other option due to contracts. \n\nI live in rural Pennsylvania, the area is developed enough where I don\u2019t feel the constant power outages are justified. I\u2019m not talking about the occasional outage for an hour a couple times a month or planned outages to prevent surges. And it\u2019s not only my home, this co-op is infamous on the western side of the state for providing the absolute worst service and it\u2019s also the highest costing provider compared to others. We have no other option due to contracts. Solar isn\u2019t viable and honestly due to their hold, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m permitted to have it. \n\nThe service drops are several times a month, rain or shine. We regularly have 12 hour outages on an unreasonable basis; I would say spanning one year, we have 20 outages which could last from 4 hours to a couple days and out of those 20 outages, maybe 5 were planned and we were notified. \n\nIt\u2019s starting to feel like gross negligence. At first I assumed it was something that simply comes with the territory. At the frequency of the outages, I don\u2019t feel blaming \u201cacts of God\u201d is accurate. It has to be an infrastructure issue. \n\nIs there anything members of this co-op can do legally to resolve this issue? I have attended member meetings in a room full of angry members demanding an improvement and it\u2019s been years of these meetings with no resolution.",

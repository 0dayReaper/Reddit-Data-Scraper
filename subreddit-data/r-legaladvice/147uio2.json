    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if I have a case here for wrongful termination or retaliation but I'd like other people\u2019s opinion.\nI was recently laid off from work but 2.5 weeks prior to being laid off I was approached by the security guard at work. He asked me out as I was leaving the office and I panicked and said sure but quickly left after that. He messaged me on a company platform that evening but I didn't respond. A week later he texted me on my personal number which I did not share with him. The day after he contacted me on my personal device, I informed my manager and HR. HR told me to respond to him on the company messaging platform saying I wasn't interested so I did. They also informed me that they would look into how he got my contact information as I was worried that if he had my number then he would also have access to my address. They told me he shouldn't have access to any of that information through a work system. He then texted me on my personal number saying he contacted me through the company directory thinking it would only go through the work messaging platform. I told HR this and told them I want to know which directory he was talking about and what other information is on there. I followed up with them twice in the same week and they did not have any answers for me. Later that week the company did lay offs and I was affected. After I was read my severance package, I was told HR was aware of the situation I raised expressing concern about the security guard having my personal information and that this didn't impact the decision. Prior to her mentioning that, I was not thinking about that at all but now I think this might have played a role in the decision. They claimed my position was eliminated but they laid me off and not the person they hired after me who I trained, who works on the same projects, and is in a more junior role than me.",

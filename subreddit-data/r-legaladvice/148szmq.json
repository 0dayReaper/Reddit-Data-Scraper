    "postText": "Hi, I am quitting my part time contractor job to pursue full time employment. Everyone I know, including people on this server have told me this contract sucks and I should not have signed it but this was my first job and I did not know better. My employer is extremely anal about enforcing every single detail about the contract in my experience working there. Based on the email I am sending her, which I will copy and paste below in addition to my contract, am I breaching this contract, or liable for damages to her? I am not the smartest person, and could really use some advice if anything here can be held against me or if I am doing something wrong. Thanks ahead of time.\n\n**Contract text:**\n\nDear \\[my name\\],\n\nOn behalf of \\[company name\\], it is my pleasure to confirm our offer of employment to you as faculty member. You will teach art lessons as an independent contractor for both on site and potentially virtual lessons with days and times mutually agreed upon by \\[company\\] and yourself. Your term of contract will start from February 2022.\n\nYour main responsibilities will be to provide quality lessons for the students you are responsible for. Faculty must maintain high standards of integrity and adhere to the school\u2019s mission statement found on our website and in the lobby brochures. In addition, you may be asked to provide minimal materials (as will the school) for students and provide their progress evaluations to the school and/or parents.\n\nYou will be enrolled in monthly payroll at a rate of $40/hr \u2013 pay is issued the first day of work on each month for the previous month. It is requested that the pay rate not be discussed with anyone other than school officials. \\[company\\] shall issue to the teacher (or any substitute teacher) an IRS form 1099 for each year\u2019s amount paid and will not withhold FICA (social security and Medicare taxes) from your compensation or make FICA payments on your or any substitute\u2019s behalf.\n\nIt is understood between the parties hereto that students acquired and provided to the teacher or substitute teacher by \\[company's\\] marketing efforts are valuable assets. It is agreed by the parties that the teacher or substitute teacher will not solicit service of private instruction of the music school\u2019s enrolled students during the term of this agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months after this agreement is terminated. **Either party has the right to terminate this agreement with at least six (6) weeks of prior notice. Failure to do the above would cause financial hardship and said teacher or substitute teacher agree to indemnify \\[company\\] for any loss incurred due to a violation of this provision.**\n\nYou will receive your teaching schedule no later than 9pm the evening prior. You will be paid fully for any cancellations made after your schedule is sent. **If you need to be absent for all or part of your teaching schedule on a particular day, it is imperative that you give ideally over one week notice and at the very least 48 hours notice. \\[Company\\] greatly appreciates if you can suggest substitutes for your students on the occasional days you may not be able to come in. In signing this contract, you agree to perform such services as listed above in a professional manner and abide to the policies of the school.** To confirm your acceptance of this offer of employment, please sign below and return to our office no later than February.\n\n**My email informing her of my moving on:**\n\nDear \\[Boss name\\],\n\nI hope you know that working with you and the \\[company\\] has been extremely meaningful and fulfilling to me, because I believe I have made a contribution to the children that I have worked with during these past few months, their lives, and their arts education.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned to you when we spoke on 5/20, I have needed to find full time work in order to financially survive. I have found a full time position at a preschool in \\[area i live in\\], and I have arranged for a very competent substitute who will be working closely with me for at least the next 6 weeks on curriculum and lesson planning, starting 5/22. She has already previously substituted for the art class, speaks Mandarin, and I will attach her contact info below.\n\nI want to express my sincere gratitude for all of the opportunities you have provided me during my time at the \\[company name\\].\n\n\\[substitute contact info\\]\n\nThank you,\n\n\\[my name\\]",

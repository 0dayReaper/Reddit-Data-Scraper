    "postText": "I live in Philadelphia PA and I've been having issues for over a month getting my property management company to repair a major structural issue that's a clear danger to me. I have all of my conversations documented with them; going back all the way to the initial request (which was submitted as soon as the issue was noticed), to requests for updates/timelines, to notifications that the issue is getting worse.\n\nSo far all they've done is send out different contractors to take pictures and \"collect quotes\". Additionally, the structural support was \"fixed\" shortly before I moved in, but looking at the property history, it doesn't look like any permits were ever pulled for it. \n\nYesterday, I filed a Dangerous Building report with the Philly Dept. of Licenses &amp; Inspections, and am waiting for someone to come out for an inspection. According to the [City Rent Withholding Act](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/1965/0/0536..PDF), I need L&amp;I or another approved agency to sign off saying that the building is unsafe before I have legal ground to withhold rent.\n\nI notified the company in writing that I've filed the report and intend to withhold.\n\nMy questions are: how do I actually withhold once I get this approval? I know all rent payments need to go into an escrow account, but how do I set this up? Can I just talk to my personal bank to set something up? Does a judge need to sign off? How would I even bring this to court? I know my landlord has the right to ask for money in the escrow account for repairs, but how do I confirm that they're not just taking the money to collect rent? \n\nTIA!!!",

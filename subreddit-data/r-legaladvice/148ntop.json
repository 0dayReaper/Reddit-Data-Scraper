    "postText": "Me and my siblings bought a commercial building and are currently remodeling it. Both of our neighbors have utility boxes adhered to our south wall which isn't the end of the world but they are an eyesore. The major problem is the neighbors to the east of us have their fiber optic/ telecommunications cables running into our rear wall, down to our basement and into their basement (separated by a cobblestone foundation) I have to extend the set of stairs to the south but the cables are in the way. These cables and utilities were buried by the city 10+ years ago and wouldn't be easy to move. Also the person we bought the building from said he never signed anything regarding the neighbors using his basement to run their cables. (He was a lawyer himself) \nIs this something I should hire a real estate lawyer for? Can I charge my neighbors for this?",

Likely a prescriptive right exists for those utilities.  If you want to move them you\u2019d be best to work with your neighbor and the utility companies",

    "postText": "Husband got brutally attacked by a dog last spring, several deep bites, clothes torn all that. We immediately hired a lawyer and the waiting began. We provided them with everything we had: photos, medical bills, then more photos of his wounds healing. We\u2019ve been checking in every few months but there has been very little progress. Last we talked to our attorney, we were told that they\u2019re waiting for our \u201chealth insurer to confirm a lien amount\u201d. We know exactly what the insurer paid for his hospital stay, we received plenty of correspondence from them which we always forwarded to our attorney. The attorney says usually insurance companies are a bit quicker with that information because they want to get paid, nonetheless it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary.\nOf course we asked our attorney what \u201clien amount\u201d means but maybe someone could explain it to me like I\u2019m 5?\nAnd I suppose my question is, are we just going to eventually run out of time and not settle? Or am I being impatient? \nState: New Jersey",

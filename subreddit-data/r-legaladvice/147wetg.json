    "postText": "Missouri.   A large limb fell from neighboring business property's obviously dead trees and hit my garage. It is a little damage, not worth filing a claim with my insurance since it is easy for me to fix it myself.  However, there are 3 dead trees on their property beside the garage and the garage roof has been hit before I bought the house. There are cut off dead limbs hung up in the trees as well.  I already trimmed back overhanging branches that I could but vertical sections on their property could snap off and fall my way.     If I notify the business owner about the dead trees and limbs in the tree, how does that change liability going forward?  What notice or evidence of notice is sufficient?    r/treelaw is private and I need to talk to the business owner as soon as I can.",

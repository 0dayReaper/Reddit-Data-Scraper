    "postText": "Hi so I have never posted here but I need some advice. So I live in Ohio and have rule 20 with my 14 yo son. This year his mom is making him work a construction job with her boyfriend. he works 4am to 4pm sun-wed. I also believe this job is under the table and also she has no work permit for him or refuses to show it to me when I ask to see it she says its none of my business. But today he called me crying telling me he can't do it. Now in my court order i get 4 weeks in the summer and I get to pick the times. No more than 2 weeks at a time. If i claim my time with him and not make him go to this job. and when she says I need to bring him home can she call the police and will I be in trouble. I know this isnt a lot of info but any advice would help.",

I don't think the law is on her side here so definitely get some legal support FOR YOUR CHILD. Try to separate the issues because they ARE 2 different things.",

However, consult the [FLSA Fact Sheet](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/43-child-labor-non-agriculture) for child labor laws. 14 year-olds can't work more than 8 hours in a day and they can't work outside of 7 AM to 7 PM, which is extended to 9 PM at certain times of summer. He definitely can't work at 4 AM.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to report this. Police. Department of Labor. Your divorce attorney.",

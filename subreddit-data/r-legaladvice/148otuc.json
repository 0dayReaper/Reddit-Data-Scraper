    "postText": "Hello, \n\nMy husband and I got married back in aug 2022. Currently he has two applications which is I-589 and I-130. He has been in the USA 7 years but did not file for asylum within the first year he was here. In oct 2022 he went for his biometric and now the USCIS website tells us his next step is an interview. \n\nYes we have a lawyer but my question when can we except to hear back for an exact interview date? \n\nWhen I ask the lawyer no time frame is given. \n\nAny insight would be appreciated.",

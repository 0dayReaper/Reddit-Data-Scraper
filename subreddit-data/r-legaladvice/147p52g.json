    "postText": "We were month to month after a year lease and gave notice on March 27. We paid rent on April 1st and moved out and gave our keys on the 23rd. The last day should be the 30th. \n\nWe understood the landlord has 30 days to provide our security deposit along with any deductions. After June started, I emailed him twice with no reply. I texted him on the 9th, nothing. I finally call and he sends me a text after stating he is traveling and will write a check next week also mentioning there was some repair work but nothing major. I gave him our address for the second time. \n\nI asked him to also include a list of repair and receipt. \n\nMy question is that this is now the 12th of June and we aren\u2019t looking at receiving a check until well into mid June and over the 30 day mark. Depending on his \u201cdeductions\u201d what actions can we take?",

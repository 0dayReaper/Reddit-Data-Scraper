    "postText": "Hello legal advice community. Today my partner was in her first ever auto incident. She was driving behind the other vehicle when it stopped suddenly with no indication to pull off. The other driver claimed she was stopping to speak to a man who had the same dog breed as hers. My partner proceeded to ask for her documents such as license, registration, and insurance policy. The woman gave the first two but claimed she didn\u2019t have her insurance information. She then called her husband who arrived and was verbally abusing my partner. My partner was very overwhelmed and drover her car back to our apartment where she lended me all the information provided. The couple also said that \u201cour policy will not cover this so we need to go through your insurance.\u201d When we attempted to call my partners insurance company they said a claim had already been open by the other party. My questions are: 1) Should my partner also call their insurance (Liberty Mutual) to open a claim through their insurance, and 2) My partner has head trauma from hitting it off the top of the car near her visor, should we visit ER and document? Thank you all in advance.",

Yes, if she has injuries, she should seek medical attention\n\nIf your partner rear-ended them because of a sudden stop, that means your partner was following this car *way* too closely.  I'm reading between the lines here a bit, but it *sounds* like one or both of you believe that fault might be shared or be the other motorist's, in which case a setting of expectations would be prudent.\n\nAt the end of the day, your partner's liability insurance should see that the other motorist's damages are taken care of.  If your partner has comprehensive (or other insurance above and beyond mere liability) her damages might also be taken care of.",

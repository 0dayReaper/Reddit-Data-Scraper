    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m currently off sick and due back next week. I have a company car and HR has asked me to drop the car off to the office while off sick.\nIt\u2019s a 45 minutes drive to the office in the middle of nowhere with not much public transport to then go back to where I live.\nI\u2019m unable to attend work because I\u2019m physically not able and was in hospital for 7 days total (4 days straight then 3 days in and out for appointments while they were trying to figure out the issue).\nMy contract for the company car does not state that I need to give the car back if I\u2019m off sick, only if I leave the business or if I change role and do not require a car anymore.\n\nThey\u2019ve asked for the car back last week while I was in hospital to be brought back that same day which I said wasn\u2019t possible as I was in the hospital (didn\u2019t check if I was ok even thought I had made my line manager aware that doctors thought I had a life threatening issue and he passed it on).\nNothing since until today after 5pm. I\u2019ve said they can come and collect it. I received a message from a colleague maybe 30 minutes later saying he\u2019ll come collect the car soon. I\u2019ve asked if he had the spare key as I wasn\u2019t free for him to come collect this last minute and needed to take my car seat out of the car. I said he can come and collect the car tomorrow no problem which seems like a reasonable timeframe. \n\nHR emailed me again to say about not being home and having all my belongings in the car (which wasn\u2019t the case) so that I need to bring the car back to the office myself tomorrow. It seems like an unreasonable request on their end as I\u2019m too unwell to do this - I wouldn\u2019t be off sick otherwise but also, it would mean I would do this for free and find a way home when there\u2019s very limited public transport.\nCan they actually expect me to spend 3/4h of my day doing this for free? I also have my daughter in the morning so I can\u2019t and I have a doctor appointment in the afternoon to follow up with my current health issue.\n\nCan I be in any sort of trouble if I tell them I can\u2019t drop it off and they\u2019ll need to collect it? If I was to leave the business I would make arrangements as it\u2019s part of my contract but being off sick isn\u2019t one of them.\nThey have been pretty unethical in a lot of ways prior to this and I\u2019m worried they always try to find a way to fire people.\n\nI\u2019m struggling to find anything online so here I am, any help is appreciated!\nI will context labour relations tomorrow but in the meantime your knowledge is very welcome.",

Why do you have a car seat in a company car (assuming you mean a baby/child car seat)?  Are you allowed to use the company car for personal travel/transportation needs?\n\nIn the end, they own the car and make the policies.\n\nI suspect you can be disciplined for using the car for personal reasons (if against policy) and for being unavailable for reasons other than your sickness ( \"have my daughter in the morning\" assuming that's when you normally would be working?)",

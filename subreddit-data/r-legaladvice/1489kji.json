    "postText": "We both are indian (I'm 19m). we started dating when we both were 18. My GF (19f) is getting a very harsh treatment from her parents bcs they have seen all our private , videos and chats some of which were explicit. They took her phone away while she was asleep. Her father knew the lock so opened it and added his fingerprint and unlocked everything and viewed all our private data. He has contacted my parents and talked with them and made me delete everything related to her, he went to great lengths to find my contact, as far as going to my mother's workplace to find her. After getting me out the picture they have taken all means of communication with the outside world and don't allow her to leave the house as she has college holidays, her father has all put tracker in all the devices in case she tries contacting me. She is beaten up too and abused verbally as well. I'm not from a village infact we both reside in metros. We both love each other and everything was consensual but her parents won't accept that, the father even was trying to force my GF to say that i forced her and and recorded without her knowledge. Please i need some legal advice on how can she escape from such hell and what precautions must i take to safeguard myself incase of such false accusations. My life might get destroyed as I'm just starting my life as a student.",

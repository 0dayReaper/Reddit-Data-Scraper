If the mother is willing to give a statement, this could negate having to file a police report.\n\nIf she cooperates, it will be less stressful for all involved. This would be the neighborly route. If she is uncooperative, then a police report would be required so that your insurance company can subrogate against them or their insurance.\n\nHowever, protect yourself first. If she is unwilling to provide a statement, then police report is the answer. \n\nThis advice was given off of the current information in the post. If the neighbors suck, then yeah police report. If this was a one-off, see if they will cooperate with the liability investigation. \n\nTLDR: A police report is a more hostile approach that could cause animosity and may not be necessary.",

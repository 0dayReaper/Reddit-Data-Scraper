    "postText": "Hello, I'm going to present a situation and I'm curious of what your thoughts are.\n\nSo my my grandmother and her daughter (my mother) live together. They arrived both on disability and share a house but my mother pays for food, utilities etc. My grandmother is trying to get on food stamps and subsidized house but has to prove she has little income.\n\n She wants to write my mother a check for \"rent\" then have my mother cash the check and hold the money to later give back to my grandmother. This way it's looks like my grandmother is paying rent and has low excess income to quality for the assistance while stoll being able to have access to the \"rent\" money.\n\nMy mother is feeling alot of pressure from my grandmother to do this scheme.\n\nIs this legal? Fraud? Tax evasion? Idk  but it have a feeling it's gonna get my mother it's trouble.",

Yes, that's fraud. \n\nThat said, this situation may be ripe for some redistribution of the shares of bills.  If mom and grandmother share bills equally and grandmother pays 1/2 of rent to the landlord or whatever is happening here, that could be a different answer.  But the situation where grandmother gets that money back at some future point this is a non-starter.",

My grandmother \"takes care\" of my mom, and because of this, my mom feels the need to cover all house expenses because she feels bad that she needs to be \"babysat.\" \n\nIn reality, I think my grandmother is a freeloader who abuses the system.",

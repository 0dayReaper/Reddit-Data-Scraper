    "postText": "Hi, 2 days ago I went to a grocery store where I bought several ready to bake oven meals. Me and my boyfriend popped one each in the oven for our dinner. We saw it was undercooked with the meat thermometer so he fried it for another 30 minutes or so until the meat thermometer said it was ready. After eating it, I began to have the rumbles (but he is perfectly fine). The following morning, I woke up with severe abdominal pain, stomach spasms, cramping, and I continued to visit the toilet every hour. I was bedridden and screaming in pain every few minutes. My doctor advised me to go on a liquid diet for 24 hours, which I did. My pain was at an 8 or 9 and the pain was so unbearable, when I chatted with her again, she later told me I needed to go to the ER. I went to the ER and I got a blood test done, a few other tests. I got diagnosed with \u201cfood poisoning or viral gastroenteritis\u201d. I have been suffering a lot and I\u2019m wondering what are my options when it comes to suing the grocery store or receiving a settlement? I was also advised to come back to the ER to get a CAT scan if my stomach spasms continue. Today, I feel a bit better but still am experiencing some painful spasms (less frequently) so I\u2019m not sure if I should go back for a CAT scan either. Thank you.",

According to your doctor this could be a run of the mill \"stomach flu\" and you can't be certain it came from the food you bought, especially given the timeline.",

Norovirus symptoms can develop within 12-24hrs, but everything else takes 18 hours or more.",

It wasn\u2019t undercooked, because if you read my post you\u2019d see that we cooked it for an additional 30 minutes after baking it in the oven by the instructed recipe time and we even used a meat thermometer to make sure it was the ideal temperature, which we googled to double check.

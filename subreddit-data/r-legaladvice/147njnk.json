    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am looking for some help in the process to getting my kitchen inspection in order to sell shelf stable breads at a farmers market.  \n  \nI live in Massachusetts, and was aiming to sells shelf-stable breads at farmers markets and short-batch home sales.  I\u2019ve reviewed all of the information on the mass.gov website, and from what I can tell from the cottage laws here, I need to get an inspection under these guidelines:  \n  \n105 CMR 590.010 (F) (2) (a)\n  \nThe rules seem fairly straight forward and I had been working to get my kitchen ready to be inspected. However when I called the town and they told me that they only inspect commercial kitchens\u2026. Or I would need to create a secondary kitchen in my home. Both of these goes against everything mentioned in the mass.gov site that lay out what is required and allowed in a residential kitchen. So my only real option would be to rent out space at one of those shared kitchens which seems like a lot more work than I originally planned for.\n  \nI wanted to see:  \n1. To confirm, is it true that a town can have different laws than the state (I.e. while the state may lay out and say residential kitchens are allowed, my town can chose to be more strict, obsoleting the state law?)\n\n2. Has anyone else run into something like this?\n\n3. I don\u2019t necessarily plan to sell in my town, so can a neighboring town inspect my kitchen if I\u2019m selling there?\n\n4. And recommendations on my next steps?",

They can legally impose more restrictions than the state does.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t necessarily plan to sell in my town, so can a neighboring town inspect my kitchen if I\u2019m selling there?\n\nNo.   You can't.   The inspection will need to be done where the baking is being done not where the bread is being sold.\n\n&gt;And recommendations on my next steps?\n\nRent out a space in a shared kitchen.  It's going to be far cheaper than adding on a designated commercial kitchen of your own.",

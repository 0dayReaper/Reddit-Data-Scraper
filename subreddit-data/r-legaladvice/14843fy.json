    "postText": "New zealand: I received an invoice from a company for parking in a parking lot ($85) for 15 minutes. It says that if i don\u2019t pay the debt will be passed to a debt collection agency. I didn\u2019t see the signs that were (arguably clearly displayed, I was just being blind) and I tried to appeal but they just denied it. The \u201cfine\u201d (invoice) is from a privately owned company - by law, do I need to pay this invoice?",

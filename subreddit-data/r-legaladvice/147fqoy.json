    "postText": "I wanted to make an update to my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/12ivhse/sued_landlord_and_won_and_now_he_is_dead/).\n\nShortly after making my post, I reached out to my stepmom, who happens to be a paralegal and luckily lives in Kansas. I wanted her to help me find a lawyer as I was having trouble getting anyone to call me back. She was able to request a favor from a friend of hers who now runs his own law firm that does probate cases. He said that I don't need to hire a lawyer, as this is a relatively minor claim that most lawyers wouldn't be interested in pursuing. With a bit more help from my stepmom, I filed a petition of allowance with the probate court via email. The court clerk scheduled a hearing and requested that I notify the lawyer handling the probate case. As soon as the lawyer received my notice she had the son of my old landlord reach out to me. He called me and he said he wanted to settle my judgment including the interest and court fees. He was actually super nice and I felt kind of bad (especially since it had only been a few months since his dad died). He ended sending me the entire amount I was owed within a few short days. I then sent his lawyer a release of claim and plan to file a settlement of judgment with the Fairfax courthouse. I cant express how happy I am to have this all finally over and to have it end in such a positive way. :D\n\nI appreciate all of you who gave me advice and helped me before. Thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

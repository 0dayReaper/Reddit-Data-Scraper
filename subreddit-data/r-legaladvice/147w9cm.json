    "postText": "I\u2019ve just started working as a teacher and I have a three year old daughter.  My line manager has told me that I only get 5 days off per year to look after my daughter if she falls ill. This seems ridiculous to me as kids get ill all the time and no childcare will take them if they have a fever or have been vomiting. Anyway, owing to several illnesses I have used up those 5 days. Now she has chicken pox. I have had today off but have been told I will likely have to have a meeting to discuss these absences, my partner is looking after her Tuesday Wednesday but Thursday Friday we have nobody as nursery won\u2019t take her back until next week provided her spots have scabbed over. I feel really helpless and just wondered legally what is the worst that could happen when I tell them I\u2019m having more time off?",

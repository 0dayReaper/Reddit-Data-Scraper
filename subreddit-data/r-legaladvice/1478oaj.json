    "postText": "My ex lives in Michigan, I live in Pennsylvania.\nHe took a picture without my knowledge of me giving oral. He sent the picture out to another person and was trying to have sexual relations with them and commented after the photo he was \u201cpissed\u201d at me. I didn\u2019t give him permission to send a photo of me in an intimate act out. When I yelled at him he said he can\u2019t get in trouble since I am not nude and it doesn\u2019t show my genitals however it shows me in the act and is obvious I was not looking or aware he was doing this. Can I report this to the police and press charges because this is humiliating to have out there and he refuses to delete any of it in his phone saying it\u2019s his \u201cproperty\u201d",

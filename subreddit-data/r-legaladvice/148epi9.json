    "postText": "So, I have found my self in a really terrible situation. Obviously I would like legal input or advice. \n\nBack ground; I've been with this company for several years, I am now on my 3rd property with the company. I am a \"Live on site property manager\" at a storage facility. This 3rd property has been the worst. My apartment flooded out the day I moved here (apparently it's done that for years when ever it rains) 6 months its finally fixed- thats just a fraction of the issues. To add to my stress, the entire property IS INFESTED WITH HUGE RATS. Like huge aggressive crazy rats.\n\nWe have pest control out twice a month. The issue is our buildings are full of gaps/cracks/NOTHING is caulked, all weather strip is bad. Whoever built the place 25 years ago left huge gaps at the top of each unit with the entire beam exposed that runs the length if the building= 1 rat gets in 1 unit, they can access 300 units. All our vacant units had been made unavailable, maintenance was supposed to \"rat proof\" them. He refused to, i was left trying to run a 1000 unit property alone, to do 100% of the maintenance alone for 3 months. Maintenance works at our other properties weekly. I was just told today Corp does not care, we are renting them out anyways, the tenants can get insurance. I just killed 2 huge rats yesterday. They poop on everything all day long, a tenant was attacked, the whole property smells like piss. Me renting these units out, knowing well they are full of rats; is this a legal liability? Can I or the company be sued? I love my job but I am sick of risking my health every day, risking my family, and smelling like freaking rat piss. \n\nOur lease of course says we are not liable for any loss, damage, or injury. While it says that, it also says we have deemed the unit to be in good condition, free from damages, and good operating order. (I'll check the exact wording) isn't this a contradiction? The other thing is, we just applied Insurance to hundreds of tenants acts (insurance compliancy) tenants have paid only the pro rare and INS claims due to infestation are rolling in. If infestation wasn't disclosed could insurance drop us or claim fraud? \n\nSorry for all the questions/rambling/if I am over reacting. This is really stressful. The tenants cuss me out everyday, I have no support, I feel terrible. I would kick someone in the face if they rented my mom a unit like this.",

Go see a real estate attorney and do a protected complaint thru them to whatever state and city entity regulates housing and consider doing your own action against your employer for whatever damages you may have. Go see the doctor too as rat exposure is dangerous.\nDon\u2019t worry about losing your housing or employment because whistleblower protection act. Remember to do nothing without counsel.",

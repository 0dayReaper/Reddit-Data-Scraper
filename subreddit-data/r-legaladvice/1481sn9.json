    "postText": "Occured in CA\n\nMy ex and I broke up in 2019. We got together when I was 17 and he was 22. I \"consented\" the first few times we did the deed. I say \"consented\" as the age of consent is 18 in CA. Throughout the relationship 99% of it was done via coeserion. He would make threats that if I didn't have s*x with him he would hurt me or my family or release pictures of me. He would put me in choke holds till I said yes. I finally escaped the abuse in 2019. I took him to court for a restraining order which was denied. I've let it go for years but it's been eating away at me. I've since moved out of state. The amount of financial abuse (him using my debit card without permission draining my money for workout gear), physical abuse, emotional abuse...I'm wondering, can I still press charges for sexual assault? What is the time limit of doing so? I want justice. I want him to finally be brought to justice after everything he's done. All the trauma that I've spent years trying to heal from. What are my options?",

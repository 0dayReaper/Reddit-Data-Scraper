    "postText": "So to start I live in STL, Mo. So as the title says a large tree branch fell on the hood of my car denting it, and cracking the hell out of  my windshield Sunday morning. When finally getting back to me today, they said that they don't cover that, and only cover my unit in the apartment complex. I'm now down $457 to get it replaced this Saturday. Is there anything I can do to get my money back from them? All help is appreciated, thank you in advance.",

    "postText": "For reference I live in texas and am a minor\n\nI had been working at a local pizza shop for almost a year. Everything was great and one of my coworkers went to the same school as me, long story short we start liking each other and go to prom. After that she stops talking to me and boss stops scheduling me. I found it very coincidental and odd (the girl isn\u2019t the issue I just think that but of info may matter)\n\nOne day I come in on a day I wasn\u2019t scheduled and tell boss that \u201chey next Sunday I won\u2019t be available, I\u2019ll be helping my dad. I\u2019m helping him prep a truck so he can deliver it to New Mexico\u201d and boss say\u2019s alright.  Next week I was only scheduled for Sunday. Which I told him in person and in text that I couldn\u2019t come in. About an hour after I was scheduled to come in I get a text saying that \u201cI put unnecessary stress on his business and that I will be receiving my last check next Friday\u201d \n\nI believe this was wrongful termination and want to know what I can do and if I can profit off of this because I struggle to keep up with the cost of food, gas, and the fees I have to pay towards a bogus ticket I got.",

Wrongful termination usually involves some type of workplace harassment, discrimination, safety, violence, etc and you have to be able to prove the reason for termination.\n\nI don't really see a case here. Move forward and look for a new opportunity.",

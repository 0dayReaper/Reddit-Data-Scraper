    "postText": "I had to make a passenger get out because she refused to get rid of the blunt she was still smoking when she opened the door to get it. I was blocked in by cars ahead of me and the rider was behind me taking pictures so she could report me (for denying her right to do whatever she wants because she has $10 I guess?) I started to back up slowly and she moved, when I turned back, there was a guy rushing me from the porch and I screamed at him and sped off. I didn\u2019t notice until today that my back side window is broken. Checked my dash cam and I can clearly see him rush toward me and hear him hit it as I take off. It\u2019s now been over 24 hrs. Is this worth pursuing or should I just be glad he didn\u2019t shoot me and move on?",

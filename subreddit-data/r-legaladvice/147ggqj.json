    "postText": "Can I retract an offer on a house prior to the seller accepting the offer? The seller is supposedly choosing an offer tomorrow at 5pm and my offer was 1 of 2. \n\nKANSAS. I made an offer on a house after feeling extreme pressure from my realtor. I made a stupid, irrational decision and I need to get out. Is it legal to do so? \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Yes, you can retract the offer. Typically, you don't have a direct way of contacting the seller so you probably have to let your agent know and have them communicate with the seller. Typically offers are signed documents, but they are typically not complete purchase agreements that can be executed by the seller simply signing them. The law typically even provides that if your representative sends a notice that you've withdrawn the offer prior to receiving acceptance, you're in the clear even if the seller did actually accept. But make sure you communicate with your realtor ASAP in writing, with a record and let them know to deliver it to the seller.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been with this company for 5 months. Nothing was ever put in writing and there is no HR. Offered salary at 40 hours a week. I never once worked less than 70, with most weeks being closer to 80. No clock in or out, but it was expected that I be available for any calls, texts or employee problems that came up, including on my days off. \nLeft due to harassment, and now I\u2019m taking stock of just how bad it was. Waiting for my final pay to see if PTO is on there, but is it legal to accrue at a rate lower than I\u2019m working?",

            "comment": "For *sick* leave, they have to accrue it based on one hour for every 40 hours actually worked. For *PTO* they can have it accrue however they want, could be one hour every 661 hours, could be zero hours. WA doesn't require PTO payout at termination unless their policy requires it.",

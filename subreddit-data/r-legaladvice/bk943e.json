    "postText": "My girlfriend, type 1 diabetic and has a heart condition called dysautonomia where her doctor requires her to drink above 120 ounces of water a day. Sometimes she can get dizzy and fall over however only for a couple seconds. My girlfriend isn't a quitter, she is very out going and won't use her conditions in the wrong way. She's also only 16 and she got a phone call from her manager explaining that she will most likely be let go. She told her that she should be able to go 4 hours without water and said she isn't entitled to water while working.\n\nEdit: She's job hunting now and quitting soon. Thanks for all the comments and people reaching out. The place is a small 7 person business so theres no one above the owner.",

She has provided a doctor's letter describing her needs and the employer is required by law to provide accomodation. Period. There is no argument they can make which is going to get them out of providing so minor an accomodation as allowing her to have a bottle of water at her counter. So let her get fired over this and then start talking to local employment lawyers.\n\nEdit: this assumes they are subject to ADA requirements, i.e. the company has 15 or more total employees.",

She has a doctor's note.

So am I, so yes, she can quit and collect benefits via an unemployment hearing (usually a phone meeting).

I asked to have a bottle of water with me at my cash register and was denied.  The subsequent doctors note requesting water was also denied.   This is 100% on her manager for being a dumbass.  \n\nTalking to the day time manager didn't work for me, because she \"felt that a bottle of water ruined the aesthetic,\" and that my doctors note was \"dumb.\"  So, I found the phone number for the store manager and called him and asked about the water bottle.  It's amazing how fast things turn around when you get the right people involved, plus have a doctors note.  The day time manager was moved to another store within a week.  \n\nMy advice is - get a doctors note and go above the managers head.

Have her bring her water bottle to the desk when she works, when her boss makes a stink hand over the paperwork. He's probably banking on her being a dumb uninformed 16 year old he can bully around. If she gets fired for it, file a complain with OSHA and EEOC and she should be eligible for unemployment as well\n\nI wouldn't quit over it, in fact I'd call their bluff and bet they wouldn't fire her over it.

I had to be on a strict diet and have a large intake of water to help. I had a doctor's note and everything. Because I was at the register, I wasn't allowed having water and wasn't allowed leaving my register to go drink water. A lot of places don't allow water or drinks or food in public areas even with a doctor's note and because they're usually low wage jobs, they know they can get away with it because 1) you don't have money to fight it and 2) you don't have the money to leave your job as you're likely dependant on it so you'll do whatever to stay. As an added bonus they can replace you in a second if you leave so they don't try and keep you.",

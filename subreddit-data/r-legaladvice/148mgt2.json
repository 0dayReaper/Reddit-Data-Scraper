    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nNeed some advice moving forward on if I should take this to small claims.\n\nI live in Boston, Massachusetts and when I moved here I had a pretty bad apartment. The management company is notorious for their slumlord-like behavior - treating tenants like cash cows, cockroached filled apartments, not taking care of the building and untimely maintenance(I didn\u2019t know this moving in). Since the apartment had cockroaches, I got to a point where I needed out due to its inhabitability. \n\nThe management company let me break the lease with no penalty and get out of the apartment without any fees. They said they would return the security deposit by June 1st and when I messaged them they told me it is not ready yet. When I asked when they expect the check to be ready I was ignored.\n\nMassachusetts law states that after 30 days from your move out date I am able to take a landlord to small claims and get potentially up to 3x the amount. \n\nDoes this situation work the same? Should I go to small claims and ask for 3x the amount on the forms? \n\nThank you",

Are there any damages to the property for which landlord might reasonably make deductions?  Does landlord have a correct forwarding address for you?  Or might they have sent the security deposit report or check to the property address?",

They also said in the thread I will have no penalties or deductions for the termination made.\n\nThe maintenance guy said verbally to me that I won\u2019t be charged for anything as it was standard wear and tear. I can most likely go back and get a written statement from him if needed. \n\nI told them I will come pick up the check and they will let me know when it\u2019s ready",

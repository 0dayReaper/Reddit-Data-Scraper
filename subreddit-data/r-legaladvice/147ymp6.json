    "postText": "I purchased a vehicle 2 years ago from a local dealership and told them I wanted a warranty before I purchased it. they added $5,200 to the price for the warranty. Today I have $11,000 damages to my car that would be covered under this warranty, but I cannot reach the warranty company. In searching the internet, it looks like this company is a scam and has numerous complaints of taking people's money. I've left messages for the dealership and no response yet. Do I have any legal recourse with the dealership?",

            "comment": "&gt;Do I have any legal recourse with the dealership?\n\nThat depends a bit on what the status of the warranty company was when you purchased the contract and what happened in the meanwhile. \n\nIf the dealer participated in the scam, you might have recourse.  If the dealer sold you a third-party warranty with a company you should have checked out before you purchased, but is otherwise uninvolved you probably don't have any recourse with them.  \n\nNearly all warranty companies have bad reviews about not covering things people think should be covered.  Why can't you reach them?  Have they gone out of business?  Do they just have a business model where they're not spending a lot of money on phone CSRs?  If the warranty company exists, you get them to honor their contract or you sue them over their breach (or arbitrate if that's what's in your terms).",

Their address is an empty lot in New York. Complaints go back for years. I signed the papers for the car and then he emailed me the copies of the car paperwork and included policy/company information afterwards.   I appreciate your help. Thank you.",

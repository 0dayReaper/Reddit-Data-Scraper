    "postText": "I'm in Connecticut. Sorry for the long post. In January 2022 I (50f) called the police on my boyfriend (53m) because he locked me in my bedroom and tried to burn the house down with me in it. My ex became more and more mentally ill and abusive over the course of five years and refused to get help. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct for trying to kill me. Two days later, I went to court and was granted a six-month protective order. \n\nFor the sake of clarity, let's call me Stacy, my boyfriend Dbag, and the state troopers TrooperA and TrooperB. \n\nThe state troopers brought Dbag to our house so he could turn over his guns and ammunition. TrooperB stayed with me. TrooperA escorted Dbag around the house to collect his 14 guns. He had hidden the guns all over the house so he could grab one quickly if I \"got out of line.\" Dbag only turned over 13 and said he sold the missing gun. TrooperA asked if they could get the FFL paperwork. Dbag said he would get it through the gun shop he sold it to. As soon as they were out of earshot, I whispered to TrooperB that my ex was lying. He never sold any of his guns. TrooperB laughed and said, \"Oh, trust me, we know. We got him.\"\n\nI called TrooperA a few times to ask him for an update on the missing gun. When Dbag couldn't produce the FFL paperwork, he changed his tune and said the gun was stolen. A few days later, he lied again and said he lost the gun. \n\nRelevant note:  Dbag once misplaced a gun and thought he left it in a gas station bathroom. He eventually found the gun. It scared him so badly, that he became very vigilant about knowing where his guns and ammo were at all times. \n\nMy mother and I spent the next few weeks packing up Dbag's things. On February 14th, 2022, we get to Dbag's workbench and see a large box filled with junk. Laid across the top of the box is a piece of fiberglass insulation. I'm very allergic to fiberglass insulation, so my mother moves it and starts going through the box. She said, \"Stacy, can you come here please?\" She found a smaller cardboard box, under a bunch of junk, at the bottom of the larger box. The missing gun was inside, loaded, with a box of ammo. It was very intentionally hidden. Dbag even put the insulation over it to keep me out of the box. \n\nI called TrooperA and told him that I found the gun. When he got there, I told him how it was hidden, about my fiberglass allergy, and about the misplaced gun episode that made Dbag so careful with his guns. We talked about how Dbag lied and how this was a blatant violation of the restraining order. \n\nDespite all of this, they never arrested Dbag for violating the restraining order. No one from victim's services or family services can tell me why. TrooperA won't return my calls. At Dbag's court date, I asked the judge why. She said she didn't know and that she could only deal with the charges brought before her. She was incredibly impatient, wouldn't let me talk, and made it clear that her biggest concern was clearing Dbag's record. Dbag got off with a slap on the wrist. He has to take a few classes about \"what a healthy relationship looks like\" and his record is wiped clean. He can get his guns back. It's worth noting that the attorney who represented Dbag at the first restraining order hearing also sits on the board of people who decides whether or not people can get their pistol permits reinstated. \n\nBefore Dbag's criminal court date, when the first restraining order was about to expire, I went back to court and got the restraining order renewed. I thought I would only get another six months, but the judge was so upset by what happened to me that she renewed it for a year. She was appalled that Dbag wasn't arrested for such a clear violation of the restraining order and said that someone dropped the ball. The restraining order expires in August and I'm terrified. \n\nIs there anything I can do at this point? I don't understand why he wasn't charged with violating the restraining order. One of his own attorneys is going to decide whether he gets his guns back or not. Is there anything I can do about that? \n\nHow do I go about getting documentation of everything? How do I get the police report, court transcripts, and any documentation about TrooperA picking up the missing gun? TrooperA said I wasn't allowed to have a copy of the police report because \"it might look bad\" for Dbag. \n\nI know this is a lot. I've never dealt with the criminal justice system before and I'm just so lost.",

We did own a house together and he did everything he could to drag out the sale of the house for a year and a half and made absurd demands. Like he said he wouldn't sign the closing paperwork unless he got 100% of the proceeds from the sale. He also wouldn't pay his share of the mortgage and knew I was borrowing money from a relative to keep it out of foreclosure. I eventually sold the house and got my 50% of the money from the sale. He refused to pay back my relative, so I had to. I wasn't left with much. He used the house to screw with me as much as he could but did it all through lawyers.",

He has access to firearms. He has a history of mental illness. That little piece of paper (and the threat of consequences that comes from violating the protection order) might be the only thing that is stopping him from attempting to contact you. I would 100% have it renewed, and keep renewing it in the future, too. Stay safe! You have no idea what he is capable of. Your life matters and you should keep advocating for your own safety.",

Legal is covered already. If the cops can't get there quickly, I'd personally legally buy a firearm and learn how to use it.",

I find it baffling that this isn't considered a violation of the RO. Whether he came back for it or not, you'd think that failing to turn it over, and lying about where it was, would be a crime in itself. I'm not arguing with you personally, it's just that the police had proof that he kept one of the guns and they just let him get away with it.",

It was hidden in the house the entire time. He was eventually going to come back to get his things. I never would have allowed him to be in the house alone because he told me he was going to burn the house down several times. He also told me he wanted everything I owned because if I left him, I was going to leave with nothing but the clothes on my back. I don't even want to think about what he was going to do with that gun when he came to retrieve his things. \n\nSo he didn't flat out admit to lying that I know of, but he obviously lied to the cops three times about the gun.\n\nEdit:  he didn't sneak into the house and hide it. He hid his guns all over the house while he was living there so he could grab one quickly \"in case I got out of line.\"",

You can't force an officer to charge someone for a crime, ultimately it's their call. If you think there was misconduct you can either complain to the department or sue. You can take it to a lawyer and see what you have.\n\nI think it will be weak, especially now. There's a month delay of him not attempting to get the gun. There is no actual proof of him intentionally hiding it (insulation and your perception of his police interview is not enough). That's just my snapshot of it, ask an actual lawyer.\n\nMore importantly, I'd work on getting this person out of your life entirely. Use domestic violence resources if need be. Your personal safety is always the #1 priority.",

He used the house to cause me as much grief as possible. He made ridiculous demands like saying he wouldn't sign the agreement to sell unless I dropped the restraining order. When he finally agreed to sell, he wouldn't sign the closing paperwork unless he got 100% of the proceeds from the sale. I eventually got him to sign and got my half of the proceeds. He wasn't paying his part of the mortgage that whole time either. I had to borrow money from my elderly mother to keep the house out of foreclosure. He refused to reimburse my mother.",

    "postText": "Context. I bought a used 2019 Chevy Silverado from my local Nissan dealership. This was January 2022, had 12,000 miles. Within the next month I noticed it was leaking in the rear window, a common problem with these year trucks. 14,000k miles, I scheduled with Chevy to have them fix the issue. A month or so later before they could get me in. They sealed the top of the glass with silicone and returned my truck to me. That worked for a few months, or at least I didn't notice it leaking because we were out of the rainy months. Well it was leaking again less than a year after they sealed it. This time it had just gotten out of full warranty. Per Chevrolets bulletin, if sealing the window doesn't work, they need to replace the window. They tried to have me pay full price for this, but I was able to talk them down to only paying 20%, which is ridiculous because the problem first occurred while it was under full warranty. It should still be warrantied under the original leak. They hold the truck for a couple weeks and replace the window and finally get it back to me. First off, the company they hired did a terrible job, silicone was squished out between the cab and window in spots. The next rain I noticed it was leaking again, so I returned the truck, and complained about the shotty workmanship. They replaced the new window with a 3rd window, and apparently had to grind the old silicone down to bare metal to remove it, and then repainted it. Well it was leaking again after I got it back. I contacted corporate to ensure they were aware of what was going on and to help cover my butt if my local dealership tried to screw me over. I returned the truck to chevy the 3rd or 4th time. This time they have my truck for like 7 weeks, without offering me a loaner. What I am told they had to replace the window multiple times trying to find the leak. It was sent to the collision center for further testing. I finally got my truck back a week or so ago. In terrible condition. Headliner cracked and drooping, trim panel around seatbelt broke, and the biggest thing was white overspray all over the roof of my black truck(primer from repainting the back from what I was told) I had to take the truck back to them to fix these mess ups. The service manager told me they had to sand the roof down and repaint it because the white specs wouldn't come off with a clay bar. So now my roof has been repainted. Ok whatever. I get my truck back last Thursday, we had a big rain finally this weekend, low and behold I found water droplets in the cab. I thought I was being paranoid. Later that day after it had dried up some, I ran the water hose on the truck for 10 minutes to double check, and sure enough water is on the inside of the rear glass...What is my next move? I'm talking with my lawyer buddy, but looking for all the guidance I can before making demands. At this point I want a replacement, but I don't know if that is something I could legitimately request. My truck has certainly lost value from all of the repainting. Additionally, the service manager did say this could be a thing that just keeps happening, which means I could be screwed down the road, I have that on record in case I need to reference it. Truck just rolled over 30k miles. I'm not trying to just live with it, water is getting into the cab of my new truck...What would you do? I know I'm leaving stuff out.",

And if they can't fix it under warranty, shouldn't they take additional steps to ensure the customer who has the warrantied truck is happy?",

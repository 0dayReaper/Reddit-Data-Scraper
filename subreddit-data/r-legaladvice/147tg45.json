    "postText": " This International Student that I know burnt his feet while working at a restaurant.  This guy is not supposed to work off campus because of his visa status. He got this gig at a restaurant that pays cash and he makes some extra money to pay off his tuition. He is hurt pretty bad and don't know his options as what to do in terms of getting some kind of money for his treatment because he don't have any insurance. Or may be even a lawsuit against the employer.\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "In general, even employees who are being employed \"under the table\" are entitled to worker's compensation when they are injured at work.    \n\nBecause the employers are not paying WC premiums for that worker, the ordinary WC insurers don't pay those claims.   Instead, the state has a fund that pays those claims and then goes after the employer. \n\nThe student's violation of his visa restrictions does not affect his eligibility for worker's compensation.   Even \"undocumented immigrants\" are, in most places, eligible for worker's compensation.\n\nThe student's worker's compensation claim will not result in a report to USCIS.     \n\nOther reports to USCIS by family, friends, or in retaliation by the restaurant owner cannot be ruled out, but are not directly tied to the WC claim.\n\nThe student worker should look up their state's WC claim process for uninsured employers and follow it.",

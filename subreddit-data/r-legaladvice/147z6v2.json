    "postText": "I am writing to seek guidance regarding a distressing situation I am currently facing. I am currently visiting my family in California and received an email a few hours ago from my building's management informing me that my London apartment has been flooded due to a leak from the apartment located directly above mine. The cause of the flood was determined to be the upstairs neighbor leaving the kitchen tap running.\n\nI am the owner of the affected apartment, which I acquired in January 2023. My current lease is set to end in July 2023, and I had planned to move into my new place at that time. Over the past few months, I have been gradually moving my furniture and belongings, including my clothes, shoes, and most importantly, my portfolio of artwork. This artwork represents years of dedication and creative output, spanning from my adolescence at the age of 14 to the present, as I am currently 26 years old.\n\nGiven the distance and my current location, I feel paralyzed and deeply saddened by the news. I have asked a friend to visit the apartment tomorrow and take photos to assess the extent of the damage, as we are uncertain of the precise condition at this point. According to the building's management, the flood has affected the entire living room (approximately 700 sqft) and both bedrooms, with the living room being the most severely damaged area. I fear that I may have lost all the artwork I have painstakingly produced throughout my lifetime, and my heart is truly broken.\n\nI am seeking your advice on how to proceed in this unfortunate situation. Specifically, I would appreciate guidance on the following matters:\n\n\u2022What immediate steps should I take to address the damage and prevent further deterioration?\n\n\u2022How can I document the extent of the damage adequately for insurance purposes?\n\n\u2022Is there any recourse available to me against the neighbor responsible for the flood?\n\n\u2022How should I handle the loss of my artwork and potentially other valuable items?\n\nAny guidance or insights you can provide would be immensely helpful and greatly appreciated. I am eager to take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of this incident and protect my rights and interests.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to any advice you can offer.",

            "comment": "For water damage, the first thing you can do is hire a water remediation company to assess the damage to your property and see what could be dried/cleaned/restored.  For anything that cannot be restored, you could want to make a list of what it is, how old it is, and approximately how valueable it is.\n\nIf you have renters insurance with personal property coverage, it might cover the cost to repair/restore your property or replace what has been destroyed.  Coverage for artwork can be hit or miss unless you specifically insured those items.\n\nWhether or not you have recourse against your neighbor depends on if the flooding resulted from their negligence.  Did they know/should they have known the leak was likely to occur?  Liability requires them to have breached a duty owed to you, which resulted in your loss of or damage to property.\n\nFor insurance documentation, photos are good.  Specific details are good.  Brand names, model numbers, ages of property, and so on.  Don't throw things out without first documenting what it was and being reasonably certain it can't be saved.  Insurance companies usually have the right to inspect damaged claimed property before it is removed, so only throw things out if they pose a risk of damaging other property, until your insurance company has a chance to see it.",

I had a leak, wood floors soaked up the water which ran underneath the wood, and a wooden armoire several feet away from the damaged area had absorbed the water on the legs.  It took a couple of days for the armoire legs to swell and show water damage.  Water is insidious and damage can be everywhere. Check every single item in the home, even if it\u2019s in a different room!",

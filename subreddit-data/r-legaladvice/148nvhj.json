    "postText": "I\u2019ve lived in my apartment for 2 years, and the lease ends this summer. \n\nI emailed my landlord this past February and told her I was going to move in with my boyfriend. I said I had no intention of breaking my lease prior to my move out date, however if she found another tenant for my apartment who wanted to move in earlier, I could be flexible. We emailed back and forth about a prospective tenant taking over my place in the spring, but it ultimately didn\u2019t work out. We haven\u2019t discussed it since. \n\nToday my landlord texted me that I needed to resign my lease. I told her I was moving in with my boyfriend, and again, if someone wanted my apartment before my move out date, I could be flexible. She said I was required to give 60 days notice (the lease expires in 2 weeks). I told her I emailed her about this last February, and sent screenshots of our emails. She hasn\u2019t replied. \n\nCould I be at fault here? I didn\u2019t explicitly say \u201cI am not resigning the lease\u201d. I also didn\u2019t give a written statement at 60 days (just the email and correspondence in February).",

            "comment": "It may not help you here but a good general practice for giving move out notice to a landlord is a very simple print out that says this:\n\n\"I am giving notice as per the terms of the lease, that I will be vacating the rental at ## Address ## on x/x/x date; this is my official 60-day notice as required by the lease\n\n&lt;Insert your first / last name&gt;\"\n\nThen sign the printed document in pen and deliver to the landlord / leasing office / property manager etc. \n\nYou can also just end an email saying the same, but if you go the email route you need to make sure in the email you request confirmation email response.",

Usually hand delivery a letter to your landlord is sufficient but ultimately the lease may specify what proper notice is.",

Unless the lease requires a method of notice, everything else mentioned in response to OP so far has been \u201cbest practices.\u201d Damages aren\u2019t awarded in a court of law for breaches of best practices. I assume nobody here has read OP\u2019s lease, so anyone suggesting they didn\u2019t give some speculatively \u201cproper\u201d notice is giving bad advice. If the lease specifies a method of giving notice, then that\u2019s what has to be done (though don\u2019t be surprised if a judge in rent court determines the landlord had actual notice, \u201cproper\u201d or not). If it doesn\u2019t specify, any method of giving notice reasonably calculated to deliver the message is likely going to be seen by a court as sufficient, bonus points if you have written proof of a discussion about it, as OP seems to. \n\nLack of \u201cproper\u201d notice isn\u2019t a legally tenable position absent a clear requirement in the lease. \n\nPut differently, imagine standing before a judge as the landlord asking for money damages for failure to pay rent. Imagine OP whipping out written proof of a discussion held via email about leaving when the lease was up, and actually trying to get the space filled with the landlord\u2019s help, and then for the landlord to suggest that OP owes unpaid rent because the notice was somehow not proper because it didn\u2019t come via certified mail, or it was too far in advance? Landlord gets chucked out of the courtroom, 100%. Anyone who disagrees has never litigated in rent court.",

    "postText": "I got rear-ended in Texas this past spring. Luckily nobody was injured, and the other driver, \"Jesse\" was in his late teens and very polite. He said he wasn't sure if he was insured or not. \n\nHe suggested settling privately, but I knew that the damage was substantial, and said I didn't think that was wise. Police responded, and Jesse was cited for failure to control speed. We got the driver's information exchange, and it said he was insured. I called our assigned adjuster after a week of no contact, and they informed me that Jesse's coverage had lapsed. \n\nI called my insurance and I got all that settled, got a loaner car, got an estimate, and replaced the car that was declared totaled. So the hassle is over for me. I have a couple questions. \n\n1) Since Jesse's lack of insurance was not known at the scene (it came up as valid in TexasSure) and we didn't learn until a week later, can/will he be cited, since my insurance has the documentation that he was uninsured when the accident happened? And what kind of repercussions will he face? He showed me insurance cards that had a policy that would kick in the day after the accident, and I had to be the one to tell him that retroactive coverage was a no-go. \n\n2) What will the subrogation process look like? Will I have any involvement? And what will it likely look like for Jesse?",

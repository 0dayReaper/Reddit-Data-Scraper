    "postText": "So I really don't know how to start this so i'll get right too it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and step dad are really into \"new age\" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird \"support group\". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I'm around they never mention any group names or what \"organization\" they work for or are apart of. Because of this I have not had much luck finding out stuff as \"new age cult\" gives to many results to look into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis Monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more \"stable\" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their \"mind awakening\" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in \"mind, body, and spirit\" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is \"closed\" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the \"leaders\" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been \"informed\" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's \"full of lies from them\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was \"trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view\". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him. My 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. My sisters dad is going to call cps too and I just got done with my call to them but I wont repeat what they said here. I will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to Florida immediately if I don't check in with him or he hears I went back to her. He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. They both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). I also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. My dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. Thanks guys for the advice.",

This is outrageous. I think your father sounds like he\u2019s got most of this under control, but don\u2019t underestimate what mentally unstable people can do. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You sound very level headed and mature, so just keep being yourself, as in, not panicking, and continuing to search for the solution.

If you go home, you're likely not going to be allowed to leave again.  So there's that to consider. Can you get on a bus to your dad's place? \n4. If you have any money in the bank your parents wil have access to it; consider withdrawing it.\n5. Call CPS for the sake of your siblings if not yourself. However they can move slow and your family may be planning to just vanish before CPS can help.\n6. You may have to consider emancipation. \n7. You are right to think this is an emergency.

            "comment": "Is it Re-evaluation Counseling (usually called RC)? This group is based in Seattle but has branches in many other locations. They are...troubling, but not in my estimation *dangerous*. Of course, that can change, and varies by location with a cult that doesn't keep much oversight over its branches and affiliates.\n\nRegardless of which cult, you are only 16 and you don't have a lot of power at this time, unfortunately. In addition to the other advice given here, which is mostly very good--calling CPS, reaching out to your dad, etc--memorize your dad's address and phone number, and that of your friends, if you haven't already. At a friend's house, start an email account your parents don't know about, and give that address to your friends so you can contact them and they can contact you. Maybe even give your friends the login info so that they can check it. It will be hard to get strangers to let you use their phone to check an email account, but easy to get them to send an email to a shared email account that says \"I saw OP on Thursday in Washington and they were fine\" or whatever. Arrange with your friends (and their parents) that if you call collect (like from a payphone or a landline) they'll pick up and assume the charges (this is why you memorize phone numbers).\n\nBut most of all **you need to find out where your mother is taking you** so that you can inform friends and your father. Do your absolute best. Buy stamps before you leave and hide them so that you can at least write to your friends when you get there and someone will know. If you think this is doable, a simple burner phone that's pre-pay could end up being really useful, but you need to figure out where/how to hide it securely before you consider getting one. If your dad is a safe person to tell about this, he could even load money on the plan so you can text or call when it's safe.  (I'm assuming for the sake of argument here that anything you say to your dad will be passed on to your mum--if that's not the case, you have a lot more options in your safety plan, but remember that your safety is paramount.)\n\nThe best possible outcome here is that you get out before your mother and stepfather can move you. The second best is that you are unable to get away, but you are able to discover the location you're being taken to, communicate it to others, and make an escape plan, hopefully involving your father getting custody of you.\n\nThis may end up not being a big deal--you may not be isolated in a compound, you may be able to have contact with outsiders, heck, your dad may be able to get an emergency custody order--but just in case it is, you need two things: a safety plan (people who know where you are, the ability to communicate with them, and your mum and stepdad not knowing about any of this) and an escape plan to get away either as soon as is feasible or, if the absolute worst happens and you are in danger, before your safety is compromised. If you have the chance to get out, do not hesitate to go. Your siblings are a concern, but you have to get free yourself before you will be in a position to help them. Also, given how these things work, probably don't trust your siblings with your safety plan and definitely not with your escape plan.\n\nETA: I know I'm a little intense about this stuff, but I was raised in a cult and left at 17.",

But also to show that you are a rational agent and deserve to testify.",

They are mandated reporters for child abuse and it could be helpful to have someone you may know involved in this. There is also a good chance that your mom may have blocked your dad's number through your cell phone carrier, try using another phone to contact him, I'm sure that he either doesn't know, or he was lied to about what's going on.",

This is sketchy as fuck lol.  You're in definitely right to try and get out of this, and try and get the rest of your family out.  If your parents are loons and want to join a cult you probably cant stop them, but I would definitely get DCS out there and explain your concerns and hopefully your -hopefully sane- father will take you guys in, and I believe he can get child support for this and such as well.  Gonna still be rough going through all this, from the sounds of it, again.  But, still better than joining a cult, which can destroy people or get you killed.\n\nEdit:  I would also tell your friends parents about all this as they can help you through this alot more, and should your parents try to come and grab you, they can atleast keep working on getting you out",

Document what's happening in as much detail as possible, and list all of your concerns, and send this to people so there is a record of it that cannot be deleted. If there's any other relatives on Dad's side of the family, try and contact them through any means possible. This sounds like a very alarming and potentially dangerous situation! Other people in your family should be informed of what's happening, so that they know where you're all disappearing to, at the very least.",

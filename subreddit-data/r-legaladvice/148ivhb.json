    "postText": "New roof was installed. 24-48 hours after installation  before final walk through/certificate of completion, a windstorm ripped 20+ shingles and they were scattered onto my lawn. There were a few close out items and specifically, there were white spots on few shingles not uniform with the rest, company asked to wait to see if rain washed it off. It didn\u2019t and they had to go back up to wipe down residue. \n\nOne shingle hit my family member\u2019s car parked on the side and damaged the paint, no dent just scratch.\n\nCalled the owner and the owner agreed to pay for the repair out of pocket (verbally/phone call), he just asked for a quote from a repair shop nearby at our preference. \n\nFamily member procrastinated two weeks to get a quote. The roof company owner changed his mind and told family member this is homeowner\u2019s insurance concern. \n\nCommunity thoughts on the above? My thoughts are since work wasn\u2019t complete, company should\u2019ve been responsible for properly installing (or securing if not properly installed) and be responsible for the damage. None of my neighbors on my street were affected by the windstorm. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about uploading a 1-star review with photo evidences supporting the above.",

What are you proposing the contractor do differently? Place a bubble over your home for a few weeks so that the shingles have a chance to adhere?",

I even asked if it should be done during the summer (this was done in Feb/March). If exposure to high temp/low wind was necessary, but contractor decided to do it the one day of the week where it was barely above 50 degrees, was that a good call by the contractor? \n2.\tdoes verbal promise of the company owner hold no weight? What if I proceeded with a paint scratch repair based on his promise and would\u2019ve kept the car in the scratched condition if the fix was not promised? I wouldn\u2019t mind driving a car few a few scratch or minor dent. I have email/text chain of sharing it with the owner and a follow up email saying here is the quote which he went silent on. \n\nFor context, I did not demand any repair or compensation from the installer. I just shared the pics and asked what will be done and the owner offered to pay for the paint scratch (verbally).",

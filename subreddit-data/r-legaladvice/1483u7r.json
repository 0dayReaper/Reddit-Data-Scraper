    "postText": "I bought a machine on Facebook marketplace for a few thousand. I went to look at the machine and pick it up after they claimed it worked. After going home and trying to set up the machine, it would not operate successfully. \n\nYou are able to download the files off the machine that show each time it was operated and the results of every process (unsuccessful/successful). \n\nThe files show that person\u2019s last successful batch was in October and they spent another month running test runs with unsuccessful results. \n\nThe file shows the machine was not used until I went to look at it in June. \n\nDo I have a chance to win in small claims court since I have proof they knew the machine was faulty even though they told me it was working?",

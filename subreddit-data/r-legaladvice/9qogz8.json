    "postText": "So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.\n\nAnyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.\n\nThis isn\u2019t legal right?\n\n*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. \n\n*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.\n\nTurns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He\u2019s stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she\u2019ll give me the rest back and that she\u2019s still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I\u2019m at a loss what to do next.\n\n*Update 3: Doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. \n\nI\u2019m still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can\u2019t touch it. Just in case they get any ideas.",

I expect people in churches to often be doing things because of a moral calling, but if the local leader is okay with your parents stealing from you it is always possible to escalate to whoever is in charge of them.\n\nKeep your calm and be friendly even if the guy is less than helpful. $500 seems like a lot of money now, but you have your whole life ahead of you. You'll make gobs more in the future and your parents will have been penny wise pound foolish in trying to bully you into their religious practices ",

This policy applies also to missionary contributions that are prepaid.\n\n&gt;When tithes and other offerings are given to the Church, they  belong to the Lord, to whom they are consecrated. The essence of all such contributions is that they are freewill offerings, made without reservation of purpose, retention of control, ownership in any form, or expectation of any benefit by the donor other than the Lord\u2019s blessings. It is therefore improper to refund contributions given to the Church. Doing so would violate the spirit of freewill offerings. In some countries, refunding contributions could also cause legal and income tax complications for both the contributor and the Church.",

Then withdraw all funds from the joint account (leave the minimum deposit needed to keep the account open) and deposit them in your personal account.\n\nAfter that, close the joint account.\n\nYou need to separate your finances from the finances of your parents as soon as legally allowable.\n\nAlso, just in case this gets ugly, make sure you have a copy of your birth certificate, your social security card, ID's, etc in your possession - there have been many cases where parents tried to punish adult kids by refusing to let them have their documents.",

It seems to me that the religious/moral significance of tithing is undermined by the enforcement by a guardian rather than an exhortation to do the right thing and tithe willingly. If I was the pastor/bishop, I'd be more interested in talking to the parents about how to raise a good person who tithes willingly rather than entrench a negative association with the church over $500. That is not worth the life-long loss from a willing and positive community member.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't misunderstand that I am endorsing the concept of required tithing for a congregation. Whole different conversation and not a legal issue. From a church-policy standpoint, though, it just seems like the parents here are also undermining the church they purportedly want to help through their actions. Might be worthwhile leverage to mediate the situation between OP and his parents.",

All of the Mormons in my office that I've talked to have their working age kids volunteer instead of giving money, so it seems pretty common in my area at least. \n\nIt won't be fun to \"own up\" as your mom put it, but you might considering offering to volunteer instead of giving 10% to get them off your back until you turn 18 and can sever financial ties.

If you have $100 in the account, it's not $50 yours and $50 the other owner; all of the funds belong to each party, and in the event of a dispute, would be given to whoever got to the bank and withdrew the funds first. So your parent is legally allowed to take whatever they want out of the account, wrong as it may be. Like others here have mentioned, your long term plan should be to close the account on your 18th birthday and redeposit any remaining funds in an account that's solely yours. Until then, two options:\n\nOption 1 - Withdraw all the funds from your joint account with your parent and deposit them into a new joint account between you and a trustworthy friend over 18.\n\nOption 2 - Cut your current losses, leave the account open, but begin only cashing rather than depositing your checks. Keep the cash hidden somewhere safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Get yourself a document safe and withdraw the cash and keep it in there until you\u2019re 18, maybe your parents will leave it be. Obv don\u2019t allow them to know where the safe is or that you even have one. I know cash-only is almost impossible any more. Cards like BlueBird (at Walmart) require the card holder be 18, possibly get a reloadable gift card like a Visa one so you can use it freely. Again, don\u2019t tell your parents. Best of luck. ",

You probably aren't getting that 500 back but you can protect the other 4500 plus whatever you make in the future. Careful about crossing your parents though. Never know how they'll react to this and if you have possessions in their house they can take that shit too even if you paid for it. Someone else said to look at this as a rent payment. Honestly it's not a bad idea to think of it that way. I know it'd help keep me from getting angry about it. Good luck.",

This is enough to allow you to cash your checks, or simply withdraw the money if it's directly deposited to your account. If your mom gives the money to the church, no way you will get it back. None. I  am a former ward finance clerk, and am thankfully no longer a member of the church. However, from a practical standpoint, you are a minor and unfortunately have to have a good relationship with your parents if you want to avoid drama and some major headaches down the road. I agree with you that it is throwing money away, but you may want to consider this a learning experience and regard that money as \"tuition\", play along and tell your mom with a smile that you will be submitting the money to the church. The long term play in this case will serve you better than sticking to your guns on this. Once you are on your own AND not reliant on your parents for support or help of any kind, you can walk away from the church and recoup your current loss of $$ (or at least cut your losses) by not giving them anything in the future when your income will be higher and won't be giving any of that to the Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (it's true legal name).",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

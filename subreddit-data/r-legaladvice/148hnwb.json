    "postText": "PENNSYLVANIA: \n     long story short, I was sued for my mother's house after she died. House just sold at auction for roughly $30k less than what she owed to a real estate company. I basically have 2 questions. 1) Am I responsible for the remaining money she owed? And 2) if I'm not am I entitled to any money from the sale. The company that bought it got it on highest bid, which leads me to believe the loan company either didn't bid or low balled it. Sorry I have no idea how this works.",

            "comment": "In general when you're sued over the property of someone who has passed, that suit is specifically to extinguish any interest you may have in that property by probate and the estate.  \n\nIf that's what happened here, you're not responsible for any money that might be owed after the house is disposed of.  \n\nAny extra in the sale after the loan company was made might become part of mom's estate, but it doesn't sound like that's a factor here.  \n\nThe loan company wouldn't, generally, bid on their own auction.  And the point of auctioning is to create circumstances for a fair market sale.  Arguing that the auction was inherently unfair would be challenging and require some specific evidence of malfeasance.",

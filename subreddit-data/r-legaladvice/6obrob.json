    "postText": "https://redd.it/6m79kf\n\nSo it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.\n\nI told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.\n\nShe was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.\n\nThank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",

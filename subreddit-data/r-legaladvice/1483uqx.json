    "postText": "Hoping someone knows the answer to these questions. NAL and I am struggling with researching the topics.\n\n1) Are vacancies on a board of directors to be posted for any potential suitor to apply? Or can a replacement essentially be cherry picked by the board?\n\n2) Do nonprofits need to publicly disclose the members of the board of directors?\n\n3) Is it a conflict of interest for a director (person who runs organization, reports to board) to seek out specific individuals to apply for a position on a board of directors?",

            "comment": "1. Check your non profit bylaws to see if there are rules defining the replacement of board directors. There are factors such as being a membership organization versus a non membership which may determine whether new directors need to be voted in by nonprofit members or just approved by the current board. Other times temporary directors can be put in place for approval later. Again your bylaws should outline what to do. New directors should be chosen based on their skill set and what they can bring as a productive asset to the board. \n\n2. Non profits should publicly disclose the board of directors. There\u2019s no reason not to. \n\n3. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing if the staff seek out applicants for the board of directors however in my opinion it\u2019s not a great idea. Current board directors should look for new applicants in fields that can help the board; for example someone whose good at fundraising or event organization, a longtime organization volunteer, someone with connections to the business community etc. If the current Board of Directors does their job there should be no need for the staff to supply applicants. It\u2019s only a conflict of interest if the person is related, is a spouse, or has a relationship that would obviously be inappropriate.",

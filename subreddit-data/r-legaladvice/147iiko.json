    "postText": "Apologies if this is a bit longer than necessary.\n\nI (30F) recently left a very abusive relationship and have a temporary protective order in place. The hearing is next week.\n\nDuring our 2 year relationship, in addition to emotional/physical abuse, my ex broke a fair number of my belongings\u2014several pairs of eyeglasses, dishes, 2 pieces of furniture, books, television, phone. A couple times I purchased tickets to an event and he would leave with both tickets causing me to miss the event. Then there are the few items I\u2019m most upset about: a painting I had commissioned ~12 years ago of my now deceased pet, and works in progress of my own (I paint as a hobby and occasionally sell these pieces). I have text messages from my ex admitting to destroying nearly every one of these things, so I don\u2019t really think it would be that difficult to prove.\n\nI am missing my 2 front teeth after getting in an argument with him. I was drunk at the time and do not remember everything perfectly well, however, I came to face down on the sidewalk unsure of how I got there and while ex never said he pushed me, he has stated many times that this was his fault and he would pay for my dental bills to have them replaced (which didn\u2019t happen). It\u2019s POSSIBLE I just fell down, I was drunk, but I\u2019ve also never done anything like that before and I\u2019m not sure how I wouldn\u2019t have caught myself at all as I was walking on a flat, decent sidewalk.\n\nAdditionally, some other details that feel relevant are: my previous roommate asked me to move out due to ex taking alcohol from roommate on several occasions. We were then not allowed to renew our lease in our next apartment because of noise complaints from neighbors calling the cops, ex has been arrested several times in the course of our relationship and spent the night in jail each time but I always refused to press charges. The most recent instance the cops did take photos of my injuries and told me they were going to put a warrant out, but I never heard anything further on that. I also lost access to my email address I\u2019d been using since high school which had all of my photos/documents saved in the drive and I\u2019ve been unable to recover the account, which I guess isn\u2019t the biggest of my issues, but does really suck that I\u2019ll never get any of that back.\n\nThe hearing for the long term protective order is next week, and a DV advocate from a local shelter is looking into finding an attorney to represent me with that. I had originally incorrectly assumed that I could sue for property damage at the same time, and understand now it doesn\u2019t work like that, which is fine. I called a few lawyers to get direction on this, but I don\u2019t have the money for a consultation (especially as I\u2019ve had to quit my job and am temporarily staying in a different city for my safety\u2014which is the second time this has happened due to his abuse) so that hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. \n\nI guess (some of, I really feel in over my head here) my questions are:\n1) Is getting him to pay my dental bills going to be impossible since I am also not 100% sure he did it, even though that seems most likely? I\u2019m a waitress/bartender and finding a new job in the service industry when you\u2019re missing your teeth is really difficult. \n\n2) Is custom art made by someone else of value? I am no longer in contact with this artist, and even if I were at this point could probably not afford to recommission the painting as they\u2019re quite a bit further along in their art career at this point. \n\n3) Is my own art of value, legally? Cost of materials at least would be owed to me I would guess, but really not sure.\n\n4) Is emotional distress impossible to prove? I\u2019ve begun having some health issues I\u2019m sure due to the stress of the situation and would also seriously benefit from some therapy, but I don\u2019t have insurance so have been neglecting to take care of that as well.\n\n5) Lost wages? Lost living situation? Travel costs for going to court? \n\n6) Is the charge I\u2019d be pursuing for all the broken stuff just \u201cproperty damage\u201d or something else? Are text messages containing admission of guilt sufficient? Should I begin researching what it costs to replace each item?\n\nI was told about the Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund but the forms were a bit confusing to me, I plan to finish filling that out tomorrow hopefully w/ some assistance.\n\nReally any advice would be greatly appreciated. Now that I\u2019m safe and away from him I\u2019m trying to figure out what specifics to focus on/first steps to take, but it\u2019s\u2026pretty overwhelming. Thank you for reading.",

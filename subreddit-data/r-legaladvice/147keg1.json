    "postText": "Hello, I am looking for both an outside perspective as well as some advice on the situation we are having with our neighbor. I apologize in advance for the length.\n\nI live in New York. \n\nBackground:\nWe have lived in our home for 6 years. It is located in a nice family neighborhood in a beautiful, albeit tourist destination town. The type of neighborhood the kids still all Identify where everyone is playing by where the bikes are laying in the yard, We have lived here very enjoyably without incident until last fall. In September, our 2 dogs were lawfully contained in our yard by their electric fence like they always are. They are friendly, family dogs who are best friends with all of the delivery drivers, and the biggest threat they pose to people is licking them too aggressively. Our next door neighbor had a small dog visiting their house, and this dog managed to run out of their yard and sprint aggressively barking at our male. Our male is terrified of things like Thunder, fireworks. and  dump trucks, and will retreat behind the couch to hide until they\u2019re gone. When this dog came charging at him he panicked and grabbed the small dog in his mouth and shook it a bit. Our dogs are not large, they are German shorthair pointers, but he definitely had the size advantage over this very small dog. The small dog was injured and our neighbor took us to town court to have our dog deemed a dangerous dog and placed all of the blame solely on us for harboring an aggressive dog. We won in town court because a)he\u2019s not an aggressive dog and b)their dog was on our property when the incident occurred. \n\n\nAfter the incident with the dogs, we attempted to reach out to discuss the situation and were hung up on and sworn at each time. Shortly after, our neighbor began receiving pickup truck loads of old tires with which be began constructing a tire wall along the property line. The tire wall was 6 tires high and 2-3 tires deep and though it started contained to one area it soon began expanding along our shared border. Aside from the aesthetics of a tire wall, we became concerned about the safety since we have 4 children, including 2 toddlers, and tire walls pose a safety threat both in collapsibility and various insects that would come with standing water inside of them. We called our zoning board who confirmed the illegality of storing that number of old tires on a residential property. The zoning guy called our neighbor to inform him that they needed to be removed and was met with a less than complicit attitude in return.  A few weeks later our neighbor started to remove the tires but before he did he built a pyramid out of them, stuck a political flag in the top, and posted it on social media with the message of \u201cyou better make peace with your maker before you cross this line.\u201d We perceived that as a direct threat and made a police report about the incident, which did not go over well with our neighbor. \n\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nA few weeks ago our neighbor placed 10 arborvitae trees (still in pots) along what he perceives as the property line, and on our side of his makeshift fence (made from cinder blocks and rails that he absolutely did not have a permit to construct).  He and his wife also began dumping all of the brush they would clear from their yard and hedgerow on our side of the fence. They also cut a hole into a patch of pines to store a trailer and other yard equipment. We began to question where the property line actually was since he seemed to be moving closer and closer to our home every time he threw a tantrum. We pulled out the survey we had done when we bought the property and realized that our property extended well beyond what we had previously thought. The survey has a measurement that indicates our line is 40 feet from the farthest edge of our house. My husband went out and placed 2 stakes at that 40 measure( he actually placed them at 35 feet just to be safe) so we could get a picture of the extent of things that were actually on our property but belonged to them. My husband and I went for a walk around our neighborhood and realized when we returned that the stakes my husband had placed had been removed and thrown at our house, my 13 year old son heard them strike the side of the house, and we noted some visible damage to the side of house. We plan on having our surveyor come this week to stake the property line, in the interim my husband replaced the stakes that we\u2019re thrown at the house, and we have moved one of our outdoor cameras to monitor that area. \n\n\nThat is where we currently stand as of last night. What recourse do we have for the damage on our house, for his trespassing onto our property, and what can we do once we have the line marked by the survey to enforce that he removes everything from our property?  We are not comfortable contacting him on our own as he has demonstrated several times how unstable and reactive he is. We have 4 children to think about, including two toddlers. \n\n\nThank you for your time and perspective.\n\nTL:DR\nAfter 6 years of living in peace we had an incident with our dog and our neighbors dog. He has been encroaching on our property little by little since (things like a tire wall). We found our survey and staked out our property line, he responded by throwing the stakes at our house and damaging oir siding. \n\nLooking to see what leg we have to stand on legally once our surveyor comes to mark the property line officially, in terms of trespassing and how we get him to move his things off of our property.",

    "postText": "I am looking to contact CPS in regard to my sister, but am not sure if they\u2019ll actually do anything. She came to stay with me for a week on summer vacation and things at home are not right. Her BMI is a 13.4. The lowest normal BMI should be a 19.5. For slender individuals the lowest a BMI should be is about 17.5. She\u2019s severely underweight and has to take many breaks when participating in physical activity. She has expressed multiple scenarios of emotional abuse. My mother has had CPS called on her multiple times before but instructed us to lie to them. If she were taken out of the home her father lives in a camper and she couldn\u2019t be placed with him. I am 21 but have lived on my own steadily with no assistance since 18. I left my mothers house due to this abuse. I have a college degree, work, and am starting a doctorate program in the fall. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and have a rental. Is there even a chance they\u2019d remove her and if so would she have a chance of being placed with me?\n\nWhat is your input?",

            "comment": "This is a state-by-state thing and you need to give your location.\n\nI'm not a lawyer but happen to be foster licensed in Texas. The social worker from CPS would investigate. If there is evidence of neglect or abuse sufficient to warrant removal in the investigator's opinion, then yes, she can be removed from the house. Simply being underweight is unlikely to meet that bar on its own. If the house has no food or interviews said she was being denied food, that possibly is. A pattern of abuse certainly helps establish grounds, but it would likely rely upon your sister admitting to what has been happening and not continuing to cover for your mom. Removal doesn't mean parental rights are immediately terminated. At least here, parents get 12 months and a plan from a judge with conditions they can meet to get their children back. In the meantime, she'd get placed somewhere else. Kin and fictive kin tend to be preferred over foster placements and group homes if they can find someone willing and suitable. So if your place is big enough and the landlord allows it, then maybe, but a lot is up to the social worker and the judge. It's not just a matter of space, either. You have to prove you can financially support her, take her to court appointments and medical appointments, take her to supervised visits with your mother. You have to meet all the same qualifications any other foster family does. You'd ideally live near where she currently lives so she doesn't need to change schools or medical providers and can still see her existing friends. They tend to prefer as little disruption as possible, understanding of course that being taken from your home is always disruptive. Again, *in Texas*, you need to have lived in the same place and had no other major life events in the past year. If you're planning to move for school, they're not going to place her with you. If you're moving out of state, that is even more of a no-go.\n\nBeware that BMI for children is computed differently than for adults. You can't just plug her numbers into a calculator from the Internet. You need to consult the [CDC Growth Charts](https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41l024.pdf). Healthy BMI is defined as between the 5th and 95th percentile for your age. 13.4 is under the 5th percentile threshold for all ages, but it's very close for roughly age 7 or so.",

Its possible that *no one* in the family will be considered for placement until they've determined the cause for her extreme malnourishment.\n\nYour sister is going to die if she doesn't get help. \n\nCall CPS immediately.",

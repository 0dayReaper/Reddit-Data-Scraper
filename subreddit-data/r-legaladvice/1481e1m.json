    "postText": "Last year(2022) in July a cousin of mine started working as a manager at a carwash making 65k per year plus potential bonus for sales in Illinois. 2 months into employment he was hit with a non compete agreement that said he cannot work for competitors within 50 miles for 1 year after leaving.\n\nIn March he left that company and went back to his old car wash company and started working as a technician.\n\nHe is panicking today because a private investigator showed up at his house while he was at work, saying he had court papers from Missouri for him. His former companys HQ is in Missouri.\n\nHe wasn't worried if the case was in Illinois because as of January 1st 2022 Illinois non competes can't be enforced if you make less than 75k, or haven't worked there for 2 years.\n\nShould he be worried this case can be brought up in a Missouri court? Should he be worried his former company has a case in either Illinois or Missouri?",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a new tenant in Washington state. I have never rented before. For some backstory my two roommates and my fiancee and I have each been looking to get a dog for the place we rent.\n\nMy fiancee and I brought a cat when we first moved in. A cat that I did not pay a pet deposit for. She didn't ask for it. My landlord did not include a stipulation on the lease, but confirmed she was pet friendly. \n\nImportant info: she lived in the house before us with her husband and kids, and had two big dogs they failed to clean up after. She had a \"dog room\" that we have converted into a lounge situation. It still smells like dog, and the carpet has a strange consistency when you step on it, and leaves a residue on your feet. \n\nWell, now she is asking for a pet deposit for both dogs that she says is going to be added onto the rent. I know that's standard, and two dogs is a lot different than a cat. Although, usually the landlord makes that clear before renting right? Aren't you supposed to include that in the lease before renting??\n\nAlso, this is a rant here, the \"remodeling\" they did to get it renter friendly felt rushed. My floors in my bathroom stick up because of the humidity. The dishwasher broke. My toilet needs a long period to recover after flushing it. Our fridge short-circuited and doesn't work right. If you have too many appliances on at once, everything shuts down. Not to mention the holes in our walls and the way that the spare bedroom buzzes ((no other bedroom does that)) when the lights are turned on.\n\n And despite promises of fixing these issues, she hasn't. Whatever..\n\nCan anyone give any advice???\n\nEdit: She has not provided a copy of the lease to any single one of us. So.\n\nEdit 2: I found a clause in the rental agreement  that states and I quote, \"In the event that laws passed and permissions granted to have a pet and oranimal or any kind, an additional deposit of 0.00 shall be required along with the additional monthly rent of 0.00 along with the signing of the OWNER of the pet agreement RESIDENT also agrees.\"",

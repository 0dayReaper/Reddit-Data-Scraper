    "postText": "So I had my first lawsuit filed against me and my company this past year. The initial lawsuit was filed in the wrong state (PA) where the plaintiff is based. Our contracts signed prior to our working together stated that any lawsuits should be filed in the defendant's home state (WI).  \nI hired an attorney recommended by a family friend in PA who i thought was going to do a couple of things. These were  \n\\- Try and reach out to see if we can come to some sort of settlement or agreement.  \n\\- If they do not want to settle or we cannot agree, to file a motion and get the lawsuit dismissed without prejudice so we can fight it in the right court (WI).  \nThe plaintiff and their attorneys stopped responding to my attorney and we waited roughly six months for a response from the court. The response was what we expected (they filed in the wrong court). After filing a short brief and hearing again from the court that they agreed with us, we carried on in WI where we settled the lawsuit after doing some discovery.\n\n  \nI put down an initial retainer of $2,500 and was told if they spent more than 50% of that then I would be notified and asked to provide more. I was never intending to fight the lawsuit in PA. My attorney was supposed to simply try and negotiate some kind of settlement, and file the motion to get the case dismissed so we could take it to the correct court/state/jurisdiction.\n\nMy question is this:   Did I pay too much? Does this seem reasonable at all?\n\nI paid Almost $25,000 to my attorney (in the suburbs of Philadelphia at $400/hour) to file a single motion, to file a single brief, and to attempt to negotiate. The motion and the brief were pretty straightforward. They  outlined that we had a contract and they were filing the lawsuit in the wrong state and against what we agreed to in the contract. I hired attorneys here in WI and they did A LOT more work than the PA attorney while also charging me about $35,000 total. It just seems off and I was wondering if there is something that seems wrong here. \n\nI appreciate any and all advice and thanks in advance for the help. I can clarify anything if needed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

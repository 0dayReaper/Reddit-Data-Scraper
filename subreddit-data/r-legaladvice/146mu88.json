When I was registering, I was persistently reminding them that this is an ADA compliant hotel room with a roll in shower with no lip. I was assured, repeatedly, that it was. Fast forward to tonight I find a regular bathtub in my room. They tell me they only gave me the partly handicapped room. All the fully handicapped bathrooms are booked. Now I can\u2019t even safely shower my nasty ass before I leave this morning on my flight back home. Fuck this shit. What do I do?",

Our rule was if you took a reservation for a handicap accessible room you were supposed to assign the room and put as detailed of notes as possible to guarantee they wouldn\u2019t get shuffled out of it by accident. Such as if someone comes to check in and they didn\u2019t have a room assigned and all I have left clean is your room that you\u2019re checking into the next day, if there\u2019s no notes saying why you need that room, I\u2019m going to unassign it to deal with the problem in front of me. Your problem can wait till the next day. Notes were the only way to guarantee that didn\u2019t happen. But unfortunately people are people and things get missed and an employee would forget to put the note in. Or a note would be in and not give enough info (such as  we had rooms that were \u201chandicapped friendly\u201d and rooms that were truly accessible. Someone with a walker was generally fine with handicapped friendly room but they definitely wouldn\u2019t work for a wheelchair). These things just unfortunately happen in the hotel business.\n\nI don\u2019t think this raises to discrimination BUT definitely go for the room comp as it was the hotels mistake. Go up as far in the chain as you have to. (If you booked on a 3rd party site it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t be able to comp you, fair warning).\n\nIn the future always try to talk to the hotel directly if you can. And then call the hotel itself a couple of days before check in to make sure everything it still good.",

There's a difference. \n\nAs others have pointed out the hotel may have a room that meets the minimum standards to be classified as a accessible room but does not meet the requirements for op.\n\nFor example\n\nLet's say the hotel has an accessible room type that can be reserved   \nThis room type is called AODA. \n\nThere are two rooms that are under room type AODA.\n\nRoom 1. Let's say has wider door frames or maybe it has accommodations for hearing or visually impaired. Legally this room might be considered accessible. Which is why they have made it bookable as an \"aoda\" room. \n\nRoom 2.  Has the roll in shower etc. Legally this room might be considered  accessible. Which is why it's also a AODA  room. \n\nOP Books an AODA. Which can be either Room 1 or Room 2. \nHe requests Room 2. Is Told it will be room 2 . But ultimately is given  Room 1.\n\nIn this example, it  is not possible to reserve room 1 or room 2.\nIt is only possible to reserve AODA. \n\nWhich can be either Room 1 or Room 2.\nThis is what I'm referring to when I say \"not guaranteed \".\n\nAs long as the guest is still in the \"Aoda\" room. The hotel has met its obligation. \nI'm not saying it's right but I can say with absolute confidence this is what hotel's do (atleast in Canada )\nI worked at many properties that did not have roll in showers but were still classed accessible.",

If this was an assurance by phone was it from someone at the actual hotel or like a company-wide booking call center in Dallas or the Philippines?\n\nOne of the things I've learned from travel is that if you call airline and hotel call centers and ask a question, you can often get two different answers depending on who you talk to.\n\nIn the future, given your specific needs, I'd recommend calling the hotel itself the day before each hotel stay and re-confirming the room type. Even then the information you get may not be accurate.\n\nYour best bet here might be to seek some compensation from the hotel chain corporate office if this is a chain hotel. Or you could start by calling the general manager of the hotel itself before escalating to corporate.\n\n\nAt a minimum, I'd expect them to \"comp\" your hotel stay.\n\nOnce you pay and give them the money though, it may be hard to get them to give you a cash refund though, they might try to resolve it with loyalty points or a free stay certificate.",

My experience with federal ADA Compliance has been that the party providing the service has to put forth a \"reasonable\" effort to accommodate the requesting individual, without diminishing the service provided to other guest. Example: florescent lights give you migraines. If the individual notifies the hotel, with \"reasonable\" time, the hotel could change the lights in your room. But it would not be reasonable for them to remove the lights in the entrance or hallways as that would impact other guests. \nHotels often times overbook their rooms, better to oversell than leave a room empty.  Its possible the type of room you requested was already booked by another individual, and it could be argued it would not be \"reasonable\" for them to relocate that other guest.\nUltimately you should speak to a GM from that hotel and explain your frustration. As far as discrimination goes, it generally has to be a willful action against a person to be considered discrimination. After speaking with a GM from the hotel, you should get a general idea of what your next step should be. Again I am NAL.",

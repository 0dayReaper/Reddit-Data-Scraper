    "postText": "I did everything by the book, and by their rules. \n\n* I bought a guitar online for $4,000 by having the seller send me a paypal invoice\n* Paypal terms say that I am protected if the seller sends me a counterfeit item and there is a Paypal invoice for the transaction (there is)\n* The seller sent me a counterfeit guitar. \n* Paypal told me to get documented proof from a guitar repair person and to send the guitar back with signature proof of delivery. Paypal told me to upload both documents to Paypal. I did both\n* Multiple representatives told me that I did what was asked and that I'd be refunded in a few days, but they have no power because the mysterious \"back office\" is handling this claim due to it being over 1,000 dollars. Back office has no emails and no phones accessible apparently\n* After talking to 10 people and calling for 4 weeks, Paypal denied my claim. Each person I spoke to said a different BS reason\n   * Reason 1: The signature at the address wasn't from the person who sent the guitar (there is nothing in their policy that dictates who the signature needs to be from, and a rep on the phone verified that\n   * Reason 2: I didn't provide tracking and delivery confirmation info (I know, ironic how they could claim #1 and #2 at the same time. I resent them the info, and they re-confirmed that I in fact sent the correct info\n   * Reason 3: That the guitar was a \"resale\" (again, nothing in their policy saying anything about that exluding me from buyer protection. I verified with a rep on the phone that this was BS)\n   * Reason 4: I had someone repair the guitar (uh, what? This is bogus and not true)\n* I called back, again, and reopened the case, but the whole process is just starting over again, with little hope for me I fear. Don't know what to do",

Spent a whole day trying to figure out how to send it back and no one gave me an answer. On top of that the guy who got hacked accused me of doing it while I was emailing him to tell him about the whole issue.\n\nEventually they guy did something to get his money back but Paypal wanted to charge me for the change of coin (guy had euros and my account is set on dollars). Finally found the phone number and after talking they credited me with enough money to cover that.\n\nNow a friend of mine lets me use her account. As she is from the US she has more freedoms than me in Argentina.",

This was back when the big scam was selling motorcycles under hacked accounts. Complete shit show. I come home to police cards in my door. So i call, they come to my house and ask to see the motorcycle i sold. Im like what bike? I dont have a bike. They explain it all to me, i get on ebay and see whats happened. File reports, prove i was out of country, send info to paypal, police investigate and send give me the info to send to paypal and ebay. Show them proof it wasnt me. Rule for the buyer, refund $19k from my account that never had the money more than 2 minutes as it was sent to whomever scammed. Went rounds with them, my bank refunded me and went after paypal/ebay. Paypal shut my account down and let me open a new account, which struck me as odd, if they thought i scammed, they would have banned me. They didnt, they opened a new, clean account. Tells me they knew it wasnt me but didnt want to screw the buyer who got scammed. \n\nSo a couple of years later, i sold 40 sets of custom bicycle hubs i make to a team owner in California for $41k. He gets them, immediately files a claim saying he never got the package. He gets refunded, i send Paypal signatures from UPS showing he got them. They decide to open a case. While the case is open, this dude starts listing the hubs for sale! I send screen shots and links to ads from the buyer, paypal says i cant prove its the hubs i sold! They are one of a kind! Im the only person in the world who makes them! Paypal closes the case saying he never got them. I ate the money, paypal closed my account. Then a year later sends me an email welcoming me back as if nothing ever happened. I sued the team owner, got half the money back, no thanks to paypal. I will lose money before ever dealing with them again.",

A lot of people don't just cut a cheque after they lose in small claims, they just ignore the judgement.   It's up to the plantiff to then go through all the processes to even \\*try\\* to collect - registering liens, garnishments, etc.   And none of that is easy or free.",

Paypal's TOS may still make this impossible, but my initial response was based on a misreading of your comment to suggest suing Paypal in small claims court.  My bad!",

It's kind of like when you get into a car wreck and somebody hits you and they run your insurance is required in Most states to pay out under the no insurance clause. However there is a loophole that some insurance is can use if you don't have a lawyer that says because we can't find the person or we don't know the person even if there's a witness we can't pay out. They would lose money it's not conclusive to business so you're really going to have to get on their butts to get this done you might even have to get legal representation. When we get legal representation businesses usually stop f****** around with us and they just do what they're supposed to do. Right now they have you on a string and they're just rolling you like a yo-yo don't put up with that crap. Pay a lawyer $1,000 and have them go after PayPal, in fact this could be more than a $4,000 lawsuit considering that they're actually breaking their own rules and lying about said guitar and said transaction. They have policy and terms for a reason it's kind of like a contract that's unspoken. And they will break their own rules in their own policies to make sure they don't lose money. Don't let that happen",

I had 2 bitcoin mining machines collecting dust and decided \"why not just throw them on Ebay and have done with it\"\n\nIt turned into a massive scam/nightmare.  Seller claimed he didn't receive them at first, but then I showed the ticket where he signed for them.  Then he claimed it was damaged and made a picture where apparently the solid steel casing had been hit repeatedly and obviously with a hammer...and no real damage was there regardless.\n\nThen when he was caught for that, he said \"Fine, I'll send it back\", and sent back 1 power supply unit instead of both miners and their PSUs.\n\nSupport just ran us around in circles every time - refunded him, he got to keep the stuff.\n\nHe even literally, through their messaging system, said \"LOL, don't fight me on this, I know what I'm doing.\"  AND THEY READ IT AND STILL SIDED WITH HIM.\n\nSo, no ebay ever again.",

It came and didn\u2019t fit the car I needed it for, which the description said it would.  I opened a refund request and was told to return the item to the seller and provide a tracking.  I did.  I never heard anything after that, never got a refund.  When I called they said I should have never sent the item back before getting a refund, and now there was nothing I could do.  I lost the $600.\n\nMeanwhile, do you believe they\u2019d have ever issued a refund without a tracking number showing that I sent the item back?  Absolutely not.  They are scammers",

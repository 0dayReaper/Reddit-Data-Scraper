    "postText": "[California] My partner and I moved out of a one BR apartment about a week ago. We were there 1 year, and left everything in great shape except for a yellow stain on the fridge caused by some magnets. We stopped using them after realizing but weren\u2019t able to remove the markings. We were just informed they will need to replace the entire fridge with a new unit and deduct the cost from the security deposit. The unit is completely functional aside from the hand-sized cosmetic stain on the side.\n\nAre we liable for the entire cost of a new fridge even if it\u2019s just stained? Is there another way to rectify this?\n\nAnd if we do need to replace the fridge entirely, do we get to keep the old one?",

You may owe them a good bit of that if the refrigerator was quite new.  \n\n&gt;And if we do need to replace the fridge entirely, do we get to keep the old one?\n\nIf the solution here is to replace the refrigerator, yes.  You should be able to get the refrigerator in the process.",

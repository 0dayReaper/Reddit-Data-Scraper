She\u2019s also leaving nasty voicemails about my grandmother and uncle wishing they did this weekend after she gets out of the hospital. I\u2019m scared for everyone\u2019s safety especially my grandmother who can\u2019t take care of my mom anymore. I don\u2019t understand why are there no options for housing for someone like my mom? Is there anything I can do? I live across the country and I just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s being let out under these conditions.",

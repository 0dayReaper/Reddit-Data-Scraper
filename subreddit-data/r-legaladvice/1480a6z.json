    "postText": "I have had unnatural hair color at my current job virtually the entire time I have worked there (going on one year). Colors including blue, pink, orange, and green. I dyed my hair rainbow in honor of pride month and am now being told that I can no longer have colorful hair. I am fearful that I will be fired if I don\u2019t comply. As a member of the lgbtq+ community I feel this is homophobic due to the fact that my hair is only an issue now that it\u2019s rainbow and during pride month no less. The only thing stated in the employee manual about it is \u201cno immoderate hairstyles\u201d no mention of shade or hue. Is there anything I can do in the event that I get fired?\n\nEdit: just for extra info there are crosses/religious symbols in the other employees offices.",

Employer may want to maintain a workplace free from political or religious messages in order to comply with their own workplace anti-harassment policies and appropriate appearance protocols.\n\nHave you asked for an explanation?  As I said, this probably isn't about a rainbow in and of itself.  If they tell one person they can't wear a MAGA hat and another they can't wear a religious t-shirt, I guess maybe you don't get to wear LGBTQ+ hair either. It doens't mean they're homophobic. It means they don't think their workplace is the appropriate place to express your personal views on certain subjects.\n\nThere is a difference between illegal discrimination (denying someone opportunity because they are female, black, of a certain age, etc.) and legal discrimination (prohibiting employees from expressing their political/religious views in the workplace with their attire).",

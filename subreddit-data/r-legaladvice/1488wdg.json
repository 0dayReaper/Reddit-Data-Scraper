    "postText": "if I signed a lease with a property before they signed up with a company (SimpleBills) to handle our electricity and services bills, do SimpleBills' T&amp;Cs still apply to me or can I contest them on the grounds that I didn't agree to them because my lease predates them?\n\nContext: I'm moving out 2 months before my lease ends. Hence, my utilities bill is going to be nearly 0. However they have sent me an estimated bill assuming how much I will incur. I don't want to do this, however they claim I consented to this according to some T&amp;C of theirs (which I never signed because when I signed the lease, simplebills wasn't even involved)",

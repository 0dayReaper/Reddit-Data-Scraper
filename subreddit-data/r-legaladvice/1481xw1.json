If she is violent, you could report her to police and CPS. \n\nProviding alcohol to a minor is indeed something that can ve reported. How is she getting you drunk? Do you agree to drink? What happens if you tell her to fuck off? What does your father think of that?\n\nThat said, chances of anything concrete being done within 3 months are small. And at that point, her legal authority over you will become history, you can leave her and, if you wish so, never interact with her again.",

Murder you?\n\nIn fact, everything you wrote here, did you actually tell your father? He is your custodial parent. And I am pretty sure he, not her, is your custodial parent for a reason. He exists to protect you from people like her.\n\nUnless you want to get into a struggle against your dad, you better at least try involving him first before trying to involve legal system, unless you believe that he is also an abuser.",

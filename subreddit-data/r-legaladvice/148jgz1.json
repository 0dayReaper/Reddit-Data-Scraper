    "postText": "So I filled out an SF-86 last year in September for my job that requires a secret clearance. I am a contractor and was about to be released from my current contract to get with my future employer. I didn\u2019t have a good relationship with my future employer\u2019s representatives because I was working remote for my current company and they wanted me in office full time. They had a perception I was lazy and didn\u2019t actually do any work which was incorrect. They noticed that I didn\u2019t have any education or schooling in my positions, so it started to seem like the chances of them wanting to hire me wasn\u2019t very good. I had just bought a house, was a month away from getting married, so a job loss wasn\u2019t something I could allow to happen.\n\nThey had me fill out a SF-86 and I left out that back in 2017 and 2018 I had been fired from jobs. I was afraid that being honest about that would have led to more questions, assumptions, and the possibility of them looking for a better trained candidate. I didn\u2019t really understand what an SF-86 was and how gravely important it is to be completely honest because the government is going to check your employers. The first time I filled one of these out was with a recruiter and he did most of the work for me. I didn\u2019t read most of the document, just filled it out to check a box when I did my first solo one in September of 2022. (dumbest idea ever and I have taken steps to never be this stupid again).\n\nRoughly a year later my new employers love me. They want me to get schooling and certification courses done, they want to promote me, and give me more opportunity. They submitted me and my position for a TS. Today they sent me a new e-quip form to fill out a new SF-86 and I am freaking out. I am going to be honest on it, 100%. List everything from nosebleeds to the times I have taken a crap this week. I talked to a lawyer and he basically said \u201cpay me 3k and we will help you\u201d, but I don\u2019t have that type of money. I have no idea what I should do. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I know I should have been honest, I know I put myself in a hole, but my fear and anxiety got the better of me. Is there any possibility of me coming out of this with a TS and my job or should I start looking for work elsewhere?",

            "comment": "Getting caught in a lie on your SF-86 is the worst thing that can happen to your prospects of getting a clearance this side of getting caught shooting up with grade schoolers. \n\nThat said, mistakes happen. You say you got fired from jobs, plural, in a one year period. Sounds like you had a hell of a year, five years ago. For the record, if there were mental health or substance abuse issues, you probably would have been fine explaining the issues and laying out what you did to get your shit together. They like people who are pro-active in dealing with their problems. In any case, there's a chance they look past this particular mistake after you rectify things. But you are *extremely* likely to be asked why you omitted that info. Be prepared with an honest answer.  \n\nBe aware that a lawyer will not be able to do much for you besides advise. Trying to threaten or sue your way into a clearance will make things worse. You're unlikely to face criminal charges, though it's not impossible. The most likely outcome, imo, is they just deny you a clearance, rendering you unable to get one for the foreseeable future.",

Still not a great look because I blatantly lied about that one, and yes I can confirm it was a fucking crazy year. I was constantly in and out of national guard deployments because of fire season in CA, my finances were completely destroyed because of losing that first job, and I racked up credit card debt. I still feel like because I lied about that one job though, I\u2019m screwed. Looking at my prior SF-86, I also realized I left a job off entirely, I was only here a week and quit of my own accord to accept a better offer, but I know they will have questions why I left it off.",

Like I said I wholeheartedly forgot to add a job entirely after working there for a week. I just have moved 4 or 5 times, dealt with a ton of jobs, it\u2019s hard for me to even keep up. Since I already have a secret clearance and my civilian employer is wanting me to upgrade, can I just deny doing the SF-86 and cite other reasons as to why? Walk away from the upgrade now?",

Because the government 100% has the submitted form. Even if they actually did, this is a bell you can't un-ring. The company will go into ass-covering mode and throw you under busses heretofore unimagined. \n\nThere's probably a way to present the correction that admits to leaving stuff out without admitting to doing so willfully. But I'm not gonna help you workshop that.",

It was approved and I have 10 years until I have to fill another one for a secret clearance. My job wants me to fill out another SF-86 to push to get a TS. As far as I have read online, the investigation into my TS would start as soon as I submit my new SF-86. So if I just decline doing the form to get a higher TS, stay in my current secret level, I should theoretically be able to keep my job and avoid any possibility of clearance/job loss.\n\nI know I lied about the job I was fired from, but I would never in a million years have the balls or desire to try and lie about never filling out an SF-86 and blaming my job, that would be a death sentence. Plus while I know my integrity is already in question, I want reaffirm I wanted to fix this issue months ago, but have been terrified to even try. Losing my job in the worst possible world economy with a home and a wife is a mortifying thought. I want to just decline this promotion, stay where I\u2019m at, and revisit this in a few years when those jobs are no longer required to be on my paperwork.",

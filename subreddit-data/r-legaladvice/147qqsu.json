    "postText": "A relative gave me a few tubes of toothpaste from NuSkin, the MLM they are part of. I did not know that it was some kind of sketchy cult-like cosmetic product, I believed that it was normal toothpaste and began using it, after all, it was free. \n\nAfter about six months of use, I had many cavities and required several fillings, crowns and a root canal to repair the damage. Between the sensitivity, the use of temporary crowns and the normal post-operation gum inflammation, I have found eating to be difficult and have began losing weight (I am already skinny to begin with). Of course, being American, the majority of the treatment cost was paid out of pocket. \n\nMy dentist informed me that these non-ADA approved toothpastes can be harmful to oral health. In this case, the NuSkin toothpaste is abrasive and wears down enamel, while also containing harmful substances that cause gum irritation. \n\nThe NuSkin website has a disclaimer stating that the product is not ADA (American Dental Association) approved, but this information is buried deep in their website.\n\nWould I be able to get any compensation from NuSkin or would I have to go after the \"distributor\"? I am not too keen on suing a relative.",

So you bought the only thing keeping them from being an illegal pyramid scheme. People have been scammed both buying and selling these products for decades. Seems unlikely you\u2019d be able to really do anything. \n\nIf you can find others willing to work in a class action suit you may be able to collectively pursue that. But it\u2019s a lot of work for minimal payout and would take years. If it ever proceeded.",

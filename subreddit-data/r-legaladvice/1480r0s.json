    "postText": "All of this happened, and is happening in, St Louis County, Missouri.\n\nA friend of mine was in a mild car accident 2 years ago when she was a minor, 17 to be specific. Nobody died and nobody required medical attention at the time. She thought everything had been settled but she found out while looking up her parents legal history that the other people involved in the crash were both trying to sue her, and had been failing to serve her for 6 months because somebody didn't know her address.\n\nShe called the courthouse and got a copy of the suit, which is claiming $50,000 in medical damages.\n\nWhat's her options given she was a minor at the time of the accident? She's had to escape her parents household and is barley scraping by financially. She has next to zero in savings because she lives paycheck to paycheck. If she can be sued for that amount what're her options for seeking out a legal defense? Apparently MO doesn't provide a public defender for civil cases. If she loses and has to pay the $50,000 what're her options since she has $0 in savings and no assets? (She doesn't own a car or a home)",

A \"family policy\" is not really a thing. A policy covers the vehicle and named drivers. Policies generally require that any legal drivers living at the property where the cars are registered to be named on the policy to be covered. It doesn't cover \"The Does\" it covers \"John Doe, Jane Doe\". First step is for her to contact her insurer at the time of the accident, as they were presumably paid to ensure her.\n\nIf she was covered on the policy then the insurance will handle that. However, she should be prepared for them to contact her parents who paid for the policy. I'm not sure the logistics there.\n\nIf she turns out to not have had coverage then she should hire a lawyer. As a minor at the time of the accident the responsibility may still fall on her parents.",

Like literally they have active arrest warrants out for them, stole the friends car, and fled the state. She has zero contact with them and her and the police can't get ahold of them for other matters before this lawsuit happened. She does have a good relationship with the insurance agent though who previously assisted her with getting off the car insurance after her parents stole her car, so she has a point on contact.\n\nAny clue what happens if the responsibility falls on her parents? Is she on the hook if they can't be reached?",

Even if it was cancelled afterwards by her parents the insurance company will handle it because it happened during coverage. Neither of you should make assumptions and she needs to start there.\n\n&gt; Any clue what happens if the responsibility falls on her parents? Is she on the hook if they can't be reached?\n\nAt that point she needs a lawyer to answer how to ha dle that.",

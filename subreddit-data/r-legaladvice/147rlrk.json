    "postText": "it\u2019s been a year but at 17(f) at my first job, my boss (28m now 29) groomed me over a 6 month period until he convinced me to have sex with him. the legal age of consent is 16, however i have gone through therapy for the past year and have a PTSD diagnosis and i\u2019m medicated for depression. when i first told the HR department, they didn\u2019t call my mom or police because i said not too. were they mandated to because i was a minor? they also wrote me a warning for \u201cdrinking on premise\u201d even though he begged me to drink. can i sue the workplace for emotional damage? i think it\u2019s time to put his ass in jail as he works for a law firm now, that\u2019s unfair to me. so i\u2019m suing him but i want to know if suing the workplace is also possible. i loved working there, but the warning and letting me as a minor go home without doing anything but firing him seems wrong. help.",

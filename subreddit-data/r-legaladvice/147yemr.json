    "postText": "I\u2019ve been informed my position is being eliminated in a few months. I have a surgery I\u2019ve been planning to do this year where I\u2019ll be on disability for at least 2 months. If I go ahead with the surgery, will I be required to exhaust my saved up PTO before I can collect disability?\n\nWhat are some things I should consider to make the most of this crummy situation?\n\nI have not yet received paperwork, but I can expect notice in Nov with a 60 day grace period where I am still employed but not working (valid benefits and all). Come January I would start my severance.",

            "comment": "Your employer can't require you to use your PTO but keep in mind, your first week on disability will be unpaid so you would have to use PTO if you wanted to be paid for that week. If you're taking state disability then you can stack that with your PTO so that you receive your full wages because SDI only pays about 65% of your normal wages so you could use PTO to make up the remaining 35% of your wages.",

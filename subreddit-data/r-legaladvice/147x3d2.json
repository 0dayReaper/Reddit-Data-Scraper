    "postText": "We did estate documents with an attorney some number of years ago. They were very basic documents. I went back to the same attorney as I needed to update a few things. I asked his office how much it would cost and they said $150 for fresh documents. I sent over what I wanted to include in the documents. He asked some follow up questions and his questions were confusing. I replied with a mix of answers and request for clarification. He responded saying, \u201cYour response is not responsive\u201d and \u201cIt is clear you are trying to cover every eventuality including some that are beyond concern.\u201d As well as some other things - it was a whole letter. \n\nI don\u2019t particularly find matters that have to be settled upon my death beyond concern. \n\nI\u2019d like to take my business elsewhere but I don\u2019t want to be sent some astronomical bill for \u201ctime spent answering emails\u201d. If I sent back a biting email and tell him I want to sever any further relationship that I could get such a bill?",

Him telling you some things are \"beyond concern\" sounds like he is trying to advise you that some items are not going to be possible or relevant for the purposes of serving the best interests of the estate. You might disagree with how he spoke to you, and you are well within your right to decide that you want another attorney. It doesn't sound like you are not expecting to pay something. Assuming that is true, and you are only concerned about getting an \"astronomical bill\" (rather than a reasonable bill), I would not recommend sending back a \"biting\" email. Simply tell him that you will be obtaining different counsel. If you receive a bill, review what you were charged for and then decide if what you are charged is actually unfair or unreasonable.",

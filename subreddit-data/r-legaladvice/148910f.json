    "postText": "i\u2019ve googled this question endlessly and i finally decided to ask here. i\u2019ve seen answers for other states but i have yet to find a concrete answer for tennessee. i noticed a roach problem when i first moved into my apartment. since then i tried to take my own precautions such as raid, bait, and a perimeter spray but it\u2019s only gotten worse. since the first month, i\u2019ve gone from seeing one roach every two days to finding 2-3 a day. i\u2019ve seen a bunch of dead roaches on the first floor along the wall. the first time i informed my landlord, the only thing they said was \u201cpest control just came by\u201d and nothing really came from that. well today i sent photos to my landlord and they said pest control will be here in two days to spray the place down. \n\nhowever, i am scared even spraying the place down won\u2019t do any good. they mainly come from my kitchen area so i\u2019m thinking it\u2019s probably coming from one of the neighbors. i love to cook and i make sure to wipe everything down clean and dry to prevent this problem. i feel like i can no longer use my kitchen or my living room, and i spend most of my time in my room. is there a way i could possibly break my lease without pentalty because of this? what are the laws when it comes to this issue?? any advice would help!",

            "comment": "NAL but I just broke my lease in Florida due to a roach infestation. \n\nDouble check the wording of your lease and make sure you haven\u2019t violated it in any way. For example my lease specifically stated I was not allowed to do my own pest control. \n\nDocument everything! If you haven\u2019t up to this point that\u2019s ok just start now. Take a photo of every single roach you kill and it\u2019s location. Take photos of how your apartment is clean and how it\u2019s clearly not your living habits bringing roaches. \n\nWhen/if pest control comes tell them you believe you have an infestation and ask them to do a thorough inspection. Document everything they say. If they never come document that too. \n\nYour lease should stipulate what the fine is for breaking the lease early (could be anywhere from 2 months rent to the full payment for the remainder of your term). Even with all this they still my stick you with a bill.  Despite all my documentation and being in the landlords office countless times even crying, I still got mailed a $5000 bill for breaking the lease. I just mailed back today my formal dispute. We will see how it goes. Even if I do end up paying $5000 (which is insanity) it will have been worth it to get out of that place.",

    "postText": "I was wondering what exactly constitutes illegal online gambling according to various state laws. I know it varies state by state, but any clarity would be appreciated. I live in Maryland, so that would be a good starting point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt usually isn't illegal to host a friendly poker game in your house, as long as you don't take a rake out of the pot for profit. You can do the same online using a site like [pokernow.club](https://pokernow.club). It sets up a game with fake money chips, and any sort of monetary exchange could theoretically happen between you and your fellow players outside of the site.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, what if a site took it a step further, where it accepted monetary deposits and allowed for withdrawals, and all money being transacted on the site was real, however, still no rake would be taken from the pot, and the site would not be making any money from the gambling in any way. Is this really any different from setting up a game in your house? I am curious how the law would interpret this.",

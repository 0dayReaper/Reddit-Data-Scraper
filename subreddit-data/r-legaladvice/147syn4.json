    "postText": "I have a district court injunction (civil) against a person who stole my property. The thief is ignoring the subpeona and other court orders to tell me where it's being kept and to return it. Bench warrant will likely be issued, but it won't mean jack because it won't be actively pursued; the thief would need to be pulled over to find them and even then, it doesn't tell me where my stuff is. Attorney said the thief could be tracked financially since I have court orders, but didn't know who could do it or how to contact anyone. I started calling private investigators and finally connected with a PI who said he knew someone who could help and so I paid him to do a nationwide bank search and then was going to do a transaction search after getting the banking info. I know my stuff is being held in a storage unit, or was when it was stolen. The thought was that I might be able to locate the storage facility if I could find a regular payment being sent there. The PI said there are only a few people in the whole country (US) who can do this legally, and he had used this individual for similar things in the past.\n\n4 months go by with me seeking occasional updates and finally the PI just came out and said he doesn't know what's going on, he can't make contact with the individual who usually does this stuff for him so he will refund my money, yada yada. He said he doesn't know of anyone else who can do this. He referred me to another PI and also a levy officer who might be able to help or point me in the right direction, but neither of those individuals are bothering to call me back.\n\nDoes anyone know what field I should be looking in? Or what an individual like that might be called and how to find them? I have called SO MANY private investigators with no luck. The longer this goes on, the less chance I have of getting my stuff back. Please do not recommend a specific person or business name as this is against the rules of this sub.\n\nEdit: location required. Colorado",

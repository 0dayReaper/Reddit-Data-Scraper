    "postText": "I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.\n\nThree nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. \n\nI managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. \n\nI'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations. \n\nI live in Tennessee. Any advice would be helpful. \n\nI also do not want to return home. My mother is abusive. DCS has seen physical evidence of abuse (black eye, bloody scratch marks, bruises) and placed me back in the home. They are useless.",

Your parents cannot kick you out of your home and it is dangerous for you and your pets to be in this situation. \n\nI know you also stated all family and friends are out of state, but is there anyone that you could reach out to, even if they are out of state?\n\n\nhttps://www.tn.gov/dcs/program-areas/child-safety/reporting/child-abuse.html",

Firstly, this is child neglect if not aduse and legally they must report it. They are also a state agency that can demand communication with your parents and will also keep a detailed record of said communication. When you get a chance, look up assistance for homeless/abandoned teens. Also, see if you can get in touch with thr United Way. They tend to have a lot of this information or can at least point you in the right direction.",

They will be able to direct you toward much needed resources and maybe even a couch to crash on.  There are so many Moms and Dads that open to helping teens in your situation.

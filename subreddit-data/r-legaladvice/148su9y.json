A couple of friends and I were talking about getting a place together because the way this economy is set up?? * big sigh * Since these are some of my closest friends, the idea of living with them doesn\u2019t sound so bad, especially if it means splitting costs.\n\nI\u2019m probably the best set up financially out of all of us. I currently live on my own, with a full time job, and both friends are currently part-timers and living with family (all of us are in NC). One friend has absolutely no rental history; the other friend who does flagged something the other day. They owe rent in another state (Illinois) and they wondered if that would interfere with us trying to get a place together. I\u2019m not 100% sure they were evicted tbh, they just left the place because they were behind on rent and they couldn\u2019t afford it anymore. Someone did eventually take over the lease, but they still owe some money.\n\nI\u2019m trying for figure out if I need to talk to a lawyer or something about our next steps here. I have to give notice to my apartment if I\u2019m not renewing my lease, so it scares me a little that I could give up my current place and then not be able to find another if places decide to turn us down if they look that deeply into my friend\u2019s background. Will they look that far into it? Could my salary possibly be enough for them to overlook the rest? I want to help them out of their current living situations if I can, so any and all advice is welcome!\n\nThanks and let me know if there are any other details I can provide!",

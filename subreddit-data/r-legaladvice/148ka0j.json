    "postText": "ONTARIO, CANADA. \n\nShe wrongfully evicted me because she didn\u2019t want to fix the mold and the leak in my home. Issued n12 to move out for personal use. She claimed her daughter needed a home urgently. \nOne month after I moved out she had her daughter open her counselling services in the unit. \n\nIs this okay?\nI have the daughter recorded (I\u2019m allowed to record audio as long as I\u2019m consenting and a part of the conversation) and she told me her mother will not fix the leak so is selling that I told her I\u2019d move in.",

    "postText": "I have court this up coming Monday about a protective order and don't know how to handle it. Some background. My wife is divorcing me (I haven't been served papers) but we are separated living in separate houses. She has an attorney and keeps close contact with my mom. She got the protective order against me and my daughter. The wife has been controlling me using our daughter as leverage aka if you don't do this you can't see your daughter. Eventually I was fed up and told her I would do what I wanted to. \n\nShe hasn't been allowing me to go to my own house to collect my stuff after being abruptly kicked out. She would keep me away saying if I went to the house she wouldn't allow me to see my daughter however I had nothing. Not even clothes. So I told her to shove it and I went in (maybe a mistake?) She ended up pushing me and eventually hitting me multiple times on end and in self defense I threw her to the side and she fell on the floor. She immediately called the police for domestic abuse. \n\nThe police showed up and assessed the situation. Nothing came of the situation except me being able to collect my stuff from my house. Next day, emergency protective order against my cars, house, her, and my daughter. The final hearing is Monday. How do I keep my daughter in my life. the wife has been using my mom as a mediator to talk to me. She tells my mom what to say to me and my mom relays the message. I hate this and so does my mom and she won't put up with it any longer. I don't give a f*CK if I have a restraining order against the wife. My feelings have went sour after all this but my daughter... I couldn't imagine a year long protective order against her. How do I keep her in my life?",

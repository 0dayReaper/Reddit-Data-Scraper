    "postText": "In Wisconsin, USA, I was following a drunk driver and called them in. Law enforcement caught the driver and they thanked me,  saying the driver would have probably killed someone if they hadn't been pulled over. Law enforcement asked if I'd be willing to give an official statement (I saw driver swerve off road completely). They called back again and asked if they could use my name on the driver's arrest warrent, and I said yes. The driver had denied a blood test at the station. \n\nMy question: is my info public? Can the person with the DUI find out who I am? If they get a lawyer and fight the DUI, could I get a subpoena? \n\nMy name is super searchable and I'm afraid they could find my name and leave false bad reviews on my business's Google reviews (I'm self employed and working hard to establish my business, a bad review could hurt me). Also, I don't want to be involved with/contacted by this person. \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "&gt;is my info public ?\n\nMaybe.  It exists as a police record, subject to a public records request.  But it probably doesn't exist as a more-easily-searched court record yet.\n\n&gt;Can the person with the DUI find out who I am\n\nYes.  They will be provided with the warrant information as part of ordinary pretrial discovery.   You may even be subpoenaed to appear as a witness.\n\n&gt;afraid they could find my name and leave false bad reviews on my business's Google reviews \n\nIf they get a lawyer, they will surely be advised that witness tampering is a far more serious crime than DUI.   The conduct you fear is one of the few ways that a person could make a defamatory statement into a crime.\n\n&gt;I don't want to be involved with/contacted by this person\n\nYou can always refuse to cooperate with prosecutors, and refuse to talk with the defendant or his counsel.  Until they issue a subpoena (which is a non-optional court order) you don't have to be involved anymore.",

    "postText": "Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.\n\nEarly in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.\n\nIt'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.\n\nAaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.\n\nAaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down &amp; helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.\n\nWe phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.\n\nI think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?\n\n",

And is a bit shit to be honest. \n\nIt\u2019s basic common sense and advertised everywhere by NSW police, the SES etc to never ever cross a flooded road. EVER. People die, quite frequently by making such risky decisions and the costs to rescue people caught in these situations is every expensive, financially and emotionally to rescuers. \n\nYour friend made a very stupid decision and is lucky he only lost his car and not his life. \n\nThe fact he still decided to cross a road that was previously clear with high flood water over it (a big warning sign for flash flooding etc) means he could\u2019ve put you in jeopardy if you hadn\u2019t have chosen to exit the vehicle but he is very very lucky not to have died himself.\n\nContact legal aid in nsw if you\u2019re worried. They do free quick advice and drop in visits (about twenty minutes) but even if he tried to take this civilly he wouldn\u2019t get very far. \n\nETA no. You have no obligation to him if he is choosing to be engage in dangerous behaviour to continue sitting in the car putting yourself at risk. \n\nIf your mate was drink driving and chucking doughies, you wouldn\u2019t be legally responsible if you chose to get out and then he hit a post because your lack of weight threw him off. \n\nIf you\u2019d been hurt you would\u2019ve been able to claim off the insurance for any medical or psychological issues. He can\u2019t claim his own negligence off his insurance (or doesn\u2019t have comprehensive) and is hoping you\u2019re foolish enough to pony up the money for his own negligence. ",

Observe whether the letter of demand states due date, and whether they provided you with time to reply. If you do not comply with those dates then the next step for Aaron is to follow statutory process for reissuing the letter of demand, until eventually bringing a claim to court for a debt owing. I recommend you look to NSW statute on the letter of demand process - it details the time periods and process. \n\n2. Do not contact the lawyer or speak to Aaron or write or say anything to them or other people around them. Do not try to write to them about your version of events. If I was advising a client, I would instruct them to delete any Reddit post as well, as it is relevant evidence that can be used to cross examine any written evidence you wish to provide and may undermine your credibility as a witness. Given a formal dispute may be a he/she said situation, your reliability as a witness is important.\n\n3. You should retain a lawyer promptly, who will draft a response to the letter of demand and provide you with counsel.",

It's like they've already found me guilty. There's nothing about court or how to pay or when. Makes me think it's more likely a fakey.\n\nI won't contact Aaron about it or ask him to read over this thread. In the case I want to save myself $$ and just send a copy to the lawyers involved and say \"Can I get you to validate that this was sent from you\" is that likely to be a risk? Or should even that go through a lawyer I pick?\n\nI recognise that might be going beyond what you're allowed to advise. I'll probably hit up a lawyer of my own this week.\n",

A letter of demand must conform to contain certain details including date of payment, otherwise it is not legitimate letter of demand. \n\n\"It's like they found me guilty\" - don't take it personally. From their legal perspective: he thinks you are liable for his loss, therefore the next step is to issue a letter of demand asking for payment. \n\nConcerning whether or not it is fake, if you want to save money then you can find the return address information on the letter and check it against the registered lawyer information online - https://www.lawsociety.com.au/for-the-public/find-a-lawyer\n\nThen - check the contact information of the relevant lawyer / law firm from the link I provided, and email that person, in VERY NEUTRAL terms saying \"I refer to letter x, a copy of which is enclosed. Please confirm in writing that you are acting on behalf of (person's name).\" That's it. \n\nIdeally you would use a lawyer for this. Don't accept a phone call about it or text message chat.

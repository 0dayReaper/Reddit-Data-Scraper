    "postText": "My ex-wife and I split three years ago.  Our divorce was finalized nearly a year ago.  She received use and possession of the home until 01 July when she was required to list it for sale.   She's been moved out for nearly a month now and left the house full of garbage, literal garbage piled up in spare bedrooms, plates of food, leftover fastfood, pet feces on the floor.  IMO she's made ZERO effort to ready the home, she moved her stuff out and hasn't cleaned the house or made it ready for sale.  \n\nDo I take her back to court?  Is it worth the lawyer fees and time?   Her alimony goes up $700 a month when the house is sold because I still pay all the mortgage and bills.  So I thought she would be motivated to get it ready but I was wrong. \n\nIs it a waste of time to go to court and hope the judge tells her she no longer gets her 1/2 of the profit?  Do I just suck it up and clean up her shit so I can move on?  I already offered her an addendum to forfeit her 1/2 of the profit months ago and I would take care of this but she declined.  \n\nWaiting to hear back from my lawyer but welcome any feedback.",

I would hire a professional cleaning service to clean the house, then save the receipt. Whenever you go back to court, request that the cost of cleaning be deducted from whatever amount she gets.\n\nMake sure you take photos documenting the issues.",

My advice would be: video in addition to photos; contiguous video starting from a close up of the house number and then pan into the inside of the home.

Too often people lie and claim that the evidence was from a different house, different dates, etc. After the clean up is done, take your \"after\" photos and videos, and again, upload to a third party platform.",

That is likely something in the $500 - $1,000 range which would be difficult to justify the attorney's fees for.  \n\n&gt;Is it a waste of time to go to court and hope the judge tells her she no longer gets her 1/2 of the profit?\n\nIt is perhaps a silly hope.  She doesn't lose half a house for not cleaning up.  She loses potentially what you spent on dealing with it.  More likely I'd try to account for those costs as a settled out the sale.  If the costs are somehow far different in scale than I'm imagining, you should likely talk to your lawyer (but again, you're talking about those costs not half the house).",

If so, just hire a cleaning service, keep the receipt, and split the cost or just write it off as a moving expense. It might be worth considering that the last three years have seen a MASSIVE boom in real estate prices that you're both going to benefit from. Having a pissing match and nickel-and-diming over hiring someone to take out the trash and clean the place up feels a little bit like failing to see the forest for the trees, especially if you both end up dragging attorneys into it.

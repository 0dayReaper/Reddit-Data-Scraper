    "postText": "Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. \n\nMy teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was \"our special secret\". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.\n\nI never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.\n\nRecently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.\n\nSo my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.\n\nI have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.\n\nPlease walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.\n\nFor reference, I am 19 years old and I live in Colorado",

            "comment": "To start things off, I am actually responsible for doing many of the investigations of suspected child abuse/neglect by professionals in my jurisdiction here in CO (I work in a large county along the Front Range), so I know how complicated this system can be but please keep with it!\n\nI would definitely encourage you to file a report with the police AND your local human services center (in Colorado, these are divided up by county). If you know what county this teacher is now working/living, I would encourage you to file a report with that county. In terms of contacting your LOCAL police department, you can certainly do this however I have seen these reports often get misplaced or sent to the wrong jurisdiction. Please file a report with the police department where the abuse happened. This will ensure it gets to the right jurisdiction.\n\n",

The statute of limitations in Colorado is, I believe, [ten years](https://www.5280.com/2016/06/new-colorado-law-addresses-sexual-assault/). The SOL for a civil suit is six years after you turn 18. If you have photos, a lawyer would be mostly likely love to take your case.\n\nEDIT: See /u/ImVeryBadWithNames comment about the SOL.\n\n\nFile a report!",

You likely do not want a criminal defense attorney, as even though they will be more familiar with the prosecutor and police they don't typically work with victims. A simple Google search will result in a number of attorneys in Colorado that work with abuse victims, even child victims. The Rocky Mountain Victim Law Center is a Denver-based non-profit that works with victims of abuse.\n\nAs many others have said, contact RAINN. They will be able to help you through every step of the process. After you have sat down with your attorney, you will go to the police, or it may go straight to the district attorney's office, since the evidence is already gathered.\n\nAs far as who to get as an attorney, you want someone that you are comfortable with. This is paramount. You will have to go though your story, and those photos, many, many times. It will likely be very difficult to do. Your attorney will be with you every step of the way, as will the prosecutor. Remember, though, the prosecutor represents the state, not you. They will be kind, and definitely interested in Justice for you, but will not put you first, as that is not their job.",

As you are now an adult and the abuse is not ongoing, they are bound by patient confidentiality. It doesn't matter that you are male and your abuser is female. Abuse is abuse. You are brave for wanting to keep other children from suffering and for that, I applaud you. \n\nAs you already have access to a counselor, I would speak to them about this first. Aside from being able to help guide you through the reporting process, they will be able to help you with the scars the abuse has given you. You were a child. Your abuser was in a position of authority. She used psychological manipulation to intimidate you so you wouldn't report her. Many abusers do this. You need not feel guilty for having not mentioned it before. \n\nI would also seek legal counsel before involving the police, just to keep yourself protected. Look for a lawyer that specializes in child abuse or sexual abuse cases. \n\nI would definitely keep seeing your therapist during and after this whole ordeal so they can help you sort through the inevitable mental anxiety you will go through. But please don't let that fear/apprehension/anxiety stop you. You are right to report this disgusting person, to keep her from ever touching another child again. Let that fuel you as you pursue justice for yourself, and safety for others. ",

Just a hole in the ground somewhere and sometimes food gets dumped in kind of jail. _You have done NOTHING wrong._\n\nThat said, please, PLEASE do not begin the process of obtaining justice by talking to the police. The cops mostly want to help you, they're going to see you as a victim. But walking into a police station and admitting to having child porn is maybe top 5 worst possible ideas. I understand this is scary and counterintuitive.\n\n_YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A LAWYER!_\n\nOther posters have suggested helpful resources if you can't afford a lawyer or need help locating the proper one. Use that! Go to a lawyer and explain everything to them. They will interact with the police and prosecutors either for you, or with you. They will not only protect you from misguided retaliation, whether it might have happened or not, they will also _vastly_ increase the chances of bringing justice to your abuser.\n\n_BASICALLY, GO STRAIGHT TO LAWYER DO NOT PASS GO._\n\nLawyer.

What I mean is that it's plausible that a 16 year old victim wouldn't be taken seriously if they complained of heterosexual molestation by a female adult. Not that it's a good thing - they should absolutely be taken seriously and it's a serious crime in many jurisdictions. \n\nBut it's not plausible that police would think a ten year old boy was \"enjoying it\" or \"becoming a man\" or the other nonsense they put on older teen victims.",

            "comment": "IANAL:\n\nAs a point of security. Make sure that you record everything you do. Meaning, note when you reported this to the police and make additional copies of every document.  *Especially* the photos. I know you don\u2019t want your eyes (let alone anyone else\u2019s) on them as much as possible, but I strongly suggest either scanning them or making physical copies, just so they don\u2019t get lost in limbo.\n\nI enjoy Colorado, but there is still some lax behavior from some of the police departments, it\u2019s also okay to find a witness like a psychiatrist. Not a witness to the deeds, but someone who you can identifiably say has also been informed and knows of the situation and that it is being reported by you. \n\nYou want the report to be at the forefront of the primary investigators mind, just so it isn\u2019t lost. Which it probably won\u2019t be. I don\u2019t know where you are in Colorado (don\u2019t tell me) but some places have speedier processes than other, but it\u2019s a great place to be safe if you feel in danger. The police can help no matter what. \n\nAlso, if you have drastic concerns regarding your rights or the laws in Colorado (which are in your favor as a victim), Colorado has many many online resources including [Lexis Nexus](http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/michie/) reference to all the laws of Colorado (Colorado revised statutes), and the Judicial/Court systems website has many many forms if you feel your process needs your own attention.  \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to call the cops, and don\u2019t be afraid to find mental health help for you or anyone affected. If you feel like it\u2019s a barrier, go to your districts community center or outreach center and ask for Counselor services for youths. There are many that can help. \n\n**Edit:** remember 911 is for emergency or aid services. They don\u2019t usually help you with things in the past, but if you don\u2019t have access to the internet or a police departments phone number, it\u2019s okay to dial them **in this instance** don\u2019t be afraid to dial it, but remember that it\u2019s best saved for true emergencies. If you have suspicion that an abuse is imminent within the day, you can also use it that way, but it\u2019s much better if you directly call the police department and leave the emergency line clear for near and true life and death situations. (Such as crashes, fires, danger will robinson etc.) Yet they will direct you to the proper line if you can\u2019t find one. \n\nHere\u2019s a good example of a service people forget. If you are old and frail and a fire alarm Is going off in your home and you can\u2019t get it, it\u2019s okay to call the fire department for help. Just remember to try to call them rather than emergency services. **Each of These services will help you find other forms of help when you don\u2019t know where to turn.**\n\n\nEdit: as other have mentioned contact [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/)\n\n[RAINN COLORADO RESOURCES](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-colorado)\nState issued: **A hot line for abuse reporting is available in Colorado**\nThe Colorado Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, 1-844-CO-4-Kids or 1-844-264-5437\n\nAlso here is the COLORADO COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT: 303.839.9999",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

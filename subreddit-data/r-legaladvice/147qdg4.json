    "postText": "I am transmale and have been using masculising hormones for 6 years, I very much pass as a cis male, have a full beard etc. When I started my job role in November I had just moved to the area so no one knew me previously or gender history. During my interview I used my birth certificate and deed poll as a form of ID as I couldn't find my passport due to the move. The only person who saw this and I disclosed my gender identity to was the hiring manager. I have not disclosed this to anyone else since working for the company. \nYesterday a colleague said to me \"someone told me, not management, they told me that you used to be a girl and changed your sex\" I shrugged this off and asked who, she then said \"they've left now\". The way she said \"not a manger\" almost definately means it was, and there is only one person who should know. \nI believe that outing me without my consent is direct descriminatiom under the equality act and potentially a criminal offence under the gender recognition act. I feel so uncomfortable at after this, I really didn't want to come in today. I'm so anxious that they've told more people and that the colleague who said something yesterday is the only one brave enough to do so. \nWhat do I do from here legally and am I correct in my thoughts on the equality act?",

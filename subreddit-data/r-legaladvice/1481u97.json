    "postText": "This is in Texas, which I know is a right to work state. However, this isn't sitting right with me. My 20y daughter is a store manager at a fast food chain. Her grandmother passed unexpectedly on Saturday and family was called to the bedside to say goodbye. They were very close. She was told they had no one to cover her shift and she'd have to come in or be fired. She told them that she wasn't coming in and they needed to find coverage. Well she has since gotten a threatening text about how the gm hates people who call in and that her hours are now cut from 5 days a week to 2. I told her to go above his head, however the gm is claiming the district manager demanded it. I know it is fast food, but she makes decent money and needs to work to pay for school and bills. Is this legal?",

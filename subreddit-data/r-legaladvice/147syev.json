Attorney isn\u2019t much help, and is charging $80 just to reply to an email giving very vague information.\n\nMy girlfriends father passed away about 3 years ago, and and the will awards an even split of 1/3 for her, her brother, and his wife (their step mother).\n\nThe issues:\n\nA) The will/probate has ordered a split of all belongings (money, personal items, firearms, etc) but the step mother (who currently lives in the home) is refusing entry to the two siblings, stating that she will pack up all items and drop them off so they can go through them and see what they want and won\u2019t give any answers on the location of specific items that they believe she\u2019s sold or hidden from them. Is there anything that can be done about this? The attorney recommended that all items are sorted through and disbursed by all 3 people together in person but the step mother Is refusing to cooperate. My girlfriend (the daughter) is the personal representative of the estate for the state during probate, but the step mother says she doesn\u2019t really care and the only way they are allowed to take anything is if she\u2019s allowed to sort through it and box it up, without them. \n\nB) Since the home is owned by all 3 of them, but the non-cooperative person lives there. Is there any way legally they can force her out to rent out the home, or sell the home? As of right now they\u2019re just forced to let her run it into the ground and the $500,000 home is losing value as time goes on. 2/3 of the siblings would like to rent it out, or have the step mother pay them some type of rent as they were hoping the home could be some form of passive income.\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

Michigan's eviction laws will need to be followed exactly.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;Since the home is owned by all 3 of them\n\nNo, it's not.  The home is owned by the estate.  I'm assuming the stepmother is not on the deed.  If she is, then everything changes.\n\nIf the stepmother is not on the deed, then she is a month to month tenant.  The estate is her landlord.  The personal representative, as representative of the estate, can enter the home with proper notice to the tenant (usually 24 hours).",

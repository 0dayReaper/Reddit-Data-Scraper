    "postText": "[This is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fvxeql/texas_i_23f_had_sex_with_a_17yearold_he_told_me/)\n\nLong story short, following everyone's advice I reached out to an attorney who advised me to begin compiling records of my communication with him and to record any communication we had going forward. She told me to avoid reaching out to him but to be prepared if he reached out to me. I downloaded a call recording app and started backing up my screenshots of our texts and messages. He did unmatch me on Tinder so thank you to everyone that warned me our conversations would go away.\n\nHe didn't say so, but I think he may have seen my Reddit post. I only say that because I know it made the front page and last night he called out of the blue to apologize and ask me to not call the police. So, either he saw it or he had a come to Jesus moment. He told me that he is 19 and that he only said he was 17 to scare me since I was being a bitch and wouldn't let him come over. When I told him to prove his age or I'd call the cops, he texted me a picture of his ID. He also says that it isn't me on the video but that he deleted it anyway. I'm not sure if this is the truth but I've got a recorded confession so that's something. \n\nI haven't spoken to the attorney since he called me but I did email her with a transcript and recording of our conversation. We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. I'm still going to be seeking legal action, I'm just not sure what action since his ID does say he's 19. In that case there was no CP although I know there's still a case for sextortion. I don't think it would be wise for me continue updating this situation on Reddit if he's here too so this will probably be the last thing I say about it. \n\nThanks to everyone that has messaged me to be supportive, I really appreciate it. I can't respond to everyone because between PMs and chats, I'm sitting on 300+ messages about that post. Funnily enough, a nice chunk of them are from men calling me a pedophile, saying they hope I get raped since I'm such a slut, trying to figure out where in Texas I am so we can hook up, etc. This man tried to coerce me into having sex with him via blackmail and I'm the one getting blamed because I had sex with someone I believed was an adult. \n\nFrom this point on, I'll only be seeing men my age or older, and IDing everyone. According to the attorney, the fact that he looked old enough wasn't an excuse. This might sound dramatic but for most of yesterday, I really thought my life was over. Never again.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.998375 71/193rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "Hi guys so recently I (m20) got caught drinking at a concert and gave security my fake id. They called the cops and I was put in jail for the night. I have a court date in a few mounths and I want to know what the best thing to do is. Some back story I was definitely visibly drunk. I don't belive I acually had a can or anything on me at the time of arrest I did not take a breathalyzer and while I admitted to drinking I was not read my Miranda rights. This happened in New hampshire. Any advice would be great I'm just a bit worried",

Even if the statement was inadmissible, the officer could easily testify as to how they knew you were drunk (odor, slurred speech, physical validity, red/bloodshot eyes, etc).\n\nYou can hire an attorney. As a first offense, there are generally options to dispose of it without it going on your record.",

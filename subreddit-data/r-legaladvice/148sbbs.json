    "postText": "I don't think my sister can do anything about it but I wanted to see if there was a chance. \nMy sister couldn't get a car in her name. Her credit is bad so her bf at the time, now ex, got it under his name. My sister had been paying the monthly payments and insurance but everything was done under the Ex's name. They broke up and the ex is a major jerk so asking didn't work. Is there anyway she could get either the car or her money back?",

            "comment": "The most likely way she could get some of her money back is on the theory that there was a verbal contract for him to sign the car's title over to her once it was paid off, or to allow her to re-finance and buy the car from him if they broke up.\n\nMost courts will not actually compel someone to take an action like releasing a car title to someone else, called \"specific performance\", based on this kind of dispute.   The court (especially if it was small claims court) would only consider money damages.\n\n&gt;paying the monthly payments and insurance\n\nAnd she's been getting the sole use of the car in return, right ?   Arguably she's been leasing or renting the car from him.\n\nIf her argument was successful, a court would probably calculate her payments versus a lease payment and award her the difference.\n\nSince the car is wholly under her ex-boyfriend's name, she could also simply park it at his house and leave the keys inside, and it would be his problem to deal with.   Her credit hasn't changed, and she benefitted from using his credit to obtain access to a car for the time that they were together.",

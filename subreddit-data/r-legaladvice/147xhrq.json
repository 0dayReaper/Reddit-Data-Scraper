    "postText": "On May 3rd, I received an offer letter to work as a remote marketing manager for a medical office in Chicago. My official start date was set for June 12th. During that time, I was hired as a 1099 contractor to work on a marketing brochure and signage for an upcoming June festival to promote the company. However, on June 6th, my manager made inappropriate and disrespectful comments to me. And, he stated I had to travel to Chicago back and forth for this role. I explained that I was hired as a remote employee and couldn't travel to Chicago for work, especially with no travel accommodations being provided. Due to the lack of an HR department, I reported the conversation to the owner of the company.   \nAfter reporting the incident on June 8th, I received a letter stating that the job offer was rescinded on June 9th. The letter also indicated that the role had been changed to a hybrid position, requiring residence near either Chicago, IL or Naples, FL. I have emails on June 8th and 9th asking for work on tasks, so I know it was not an ongoing conversation to switch the job role. Do I have grounds to sue? I am thinking this is misrepresentation and retaliation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: They have not paid me for the 1099 work. And, they are requesting the return of the company laptop without providing me anything to ship it back with.",

And, I asked for travel accommodations. And, he stated there wasn't any because their budget doesn't cover it.",

Most retaliation isn't illegal retaliation; most inappropriate comments aren't *illegally* inappropriate, etc. Here's what happened. They hired you. They didn't like your work. Instead of firing you, they tried to work with you. You didn't take the hint that your work was (to them) subpar and you made more demands. They terminated. That's pretty much it. Even if you disagree with that assessment, no laws were broken.",

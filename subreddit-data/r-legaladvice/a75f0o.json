    "postText": "I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.\n\n Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. \n\nSo they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their \"right\" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. \n\nSo we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. \n\nWe had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like \"do you have any antifreeze?\" I was really taken aback and I think I asked \"I think so, do you need some?\" \n\nHe then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of \"being cruel to his dogs.\" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. \n\n\nThe officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a \"specialist\" over to our house and look through our \"internet history\" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define \"specialist\" and \"internet history\" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) \"not yet.\" \nI asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his \"specialist\" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. \n\nI just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous \"internet history\" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. \n\nShe thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. \n\nThank you very much for any advice. \n\ntl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our \"internet history\" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not. \n",

Don't even allow police into your home without a warrant. \n\nIt bugs me when people say \"I have nothing to hide so they can check\". It's not right.

Absolutely not.\n\n&gt;All around this country, every day and night, police officers are advising other people\u2019s children to give up their right to remain silent by answering a few questions, or to consent to a search that the officer has no right to demand.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But, it turns out, when these same officers go home at night, they advise their children to do just the opposite.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That pretty much sums it all up, and tells you just about everything you need to know about dealing with the police.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Far too many Americans mistakenly think: \u201cIf the police want to ask me a few questions, and I know in my heart I have done nothing wrong, surely it cannot hurt to cooperate with them and do whatever I can to allay their suspicions and clear things up.\u201d That attitude is certainly understandable, but it can be a deadly mistake, and it can land you in prison for a crime you did not commit.\n\nContact your lawyer.  Ask their advice.\n\nDon't believe us.\n\nGet off of Reddit and ask your own attorney what to do.\n\nAgain, I understand, I sympathize, and it's a nice quality of your wife.  But fuck no.\n\n&gt;The police can lie to you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even though our legal system allows the police to prosecute you for lying to them, you have no similar protection against dishonesty by the police. **Quite the contrary: our courts allow and encourage officers to lie to you if that will help encourage you to waive your right to remain silent**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Police officers routinely lie to criminal suspects about every aspect of a criminal investigation. So don\u2019t think for a minute that you can trust your instincts when they tell you that it is safe to talk to the police, because the police are not required to put any of their cards on the table, or to give you any information about what they are really looking into, and why they suspect you might be involved. And the courts will let them get away with it every time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Once that policeman made it clear he didn't want your antifreeze for practical purposes you really needed to stop talking to them.

Even if the detective and prosecutor are some paragons of justice and are trying to exonerate you you still shouldn't let them.

First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "Hello! Any tips or resources would be helpful. My sister in laws dad was deported in 2003 and missed his court date to finalize his divorce to her mom. It\u2019s 2023 and he is planning on getting remarried in his country of origin. Her mother is threatening to call the police? Because they never got officially divorced. Her reasoning is \u201cpension\u201d. Her father never worked a job long enough to receive a pension so we think she\u2019s just making stuff up. Is it possible for him to remarry? Would the police do anything? Would they care since he\u2019s in a different country now? Thank you in advance!",

    "postText": "So, my mother is on hospice and we live in Virginia. \nRecently she transferred her whole savings to her checking. She'd already given me her debit card and banking info to make purchases of supplies for her (medical, food she wants), start to set up care, pay bills, and post mortem arrangements. I am not on her account. We agreed we needed a POA also in case she became incapacitated. We set up for this week for a lawyer to come. She is bed bound. She has no other assets. Nothing much to manage. \n\nShe had a Drastic change in ability very suddenly. Hospice said it may be her new baseline. She can answer yes and no questions. Give short sentences half the time, but has trouble stating place and time. Her decline is speeding up rapidly. We may have more like weeks, not months. If that. A big IF. \n\nMy questions are this. Does this change eliminate her ability to sign off on a basic durable POA? If so, I need to file a petition to do so, and have MDs sign off on it. But, do I Have to do that? I have access, and permission before her abilities became limited. The reason I ask is because we have to arrange private home health care for me to even do any of this. Right now we're just using it for when I'm at work. I'm with her the rest of the time to give care. If I don't need the POA, I can stay close if she needs me, or anything happens, and not waste time going downtown and to court to do this if she can't sign. I'd rather not do all that if we don't have to.",

            "comment": "It sounds like she might be beyond the capacity to sign a POA.  To \u201cbe of sound mind\u201d, she needs to be able to understand the ramifications of what she is signing.   You may want to ask her drs about their opinion.  If there is a local department for aging or something like that you might try reaching out to them.  Her hospice may also be able to provide some guidance.  You won\u2019t be the first person they\u2019ve encountered in this scenario.  Good luck.",

This guy is a sub contractor and he said my father still has unpaid dues for some of the work he's done. We have no money to pay this guy.",

If you probate dad's estate you may have to pay this guy out of the assets in dad's estate even if those assets were otherwise scheduled to pass to you.",

There's nothing wrong with that sense, or even with reaching the conclusion that you need to resolve it in some way.  \n\nAs a legal matter, so long as you've not taken assets from dad's estate, you have no obligation to do so.  You can walk away.",

So for instance, if your father had a house, and this subcontractor has a lien on the house, he will need to be paid off out of the sales proceeds.\n\nThis assumes that you have not agreed to be liable for your father's debts, such as by co-signing or guaranteeing a loan.",

So, no, as a general rule creditors of the estate do not have a claim on life insurance proceeds.\n\nThe one exception I can think of is where the person's estate is the beneficiary of their life insurance policy, but that is unusual.",

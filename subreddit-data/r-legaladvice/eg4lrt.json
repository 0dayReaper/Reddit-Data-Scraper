We've all had posts where we were actually correct but were initially downvoted, only to have a comment rise after enough people see it. Putting a lid on things early after \"enough advice has been given\" is a particularly bad way to run a *legal advice subreddit*.",

This also includes that \"and a happy new year\" follows merry christmas, meaning it is a separate yet acknowledged event. And/or means it would be covered to universally wish everyone some level of merriment with no absolute guarantee\n\nAt the end of the day, it'd be a pointless debate based of the letter over the spirit of the law and phrase- so perfect for bored lawyers to drone on to a tired judge.",

It was some guy being charged with a crime in a Native American tribal court and he didn't have enough money to pay for an attorney. Obviously the default advice here is \"you can get a free public defender here are some links Reddit can't help you here etc\". \n\nBut here's the thing: apparently there is no right under the Indian Civil Rights Act to have a public defender in tribal court. The right only allows the defendant \"at his own expense to have the assistance of counsel for his defense\" for cases under 1 year in jail. Good fucking luck trying to find free legal aid that both is capable of dealing with tribal law and can even practise before the court OP was going before. Especially considering OP alleged that the court was corrupt and predisposed to find him guilty because the guy who accused him was a prominent tribal figure. He can be sentenced to jail for an entire year without any legal representation to stop it.",

See, when you have purposely vague wording (aka legalese designed to be as general as possible), the courts look to the \"Reasonable person\" argument. Aka what would a person of the expected average intelligence and knowledge on the subject at hand be/do/think in this scenario.\n\nCurrently there are only [11 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_calendar) which don't use the Gregorian Calendar officially and/or alone. Only 4 of them downright do not use it. Outside of those 4 areas, it can be assumed by most courts of law that a reasonable person would accept the use of the Gregorian, or \"civil\" calendar for any generally broad statements, especially in places like the US where there is an indisputably vast majority usage over any other option.\n\nPlus calendar usage options just isn't a protected class so on top of all this it wouldn't really stand in the US or anywhere else that doesn't have a protected class for calendar usage. There is no religion that could be argued a reasonable person would know about that specifically demands the usage of a different calendar.",

That's the thing I didn't learn in law school.\n\nThere is no one more valuable to an attorney than their staff. A good legal secretary keeps you on calendar and the riff raff out the door. A good paralegal keeps you on top terms with the clerks of court, filed on time, and the hard work completed. \n\nThe mods on this sub are those staffers, maybe wouldn't be mine, but it's easy to see the good they do. Thank you all. \n\nOther attorneys, future or past or just hopeful like me, appreciate your office staff more. They carry your ass every day for nickels on the dollar.",

    "postText": "While on vacation for a month, I paused my car insurance premium. Unfortunately, I forgot to resume my premium upon returning, and as a result, I was pulled over by a police officer who issued me a traffic ticket for driving without insurance. It's worth noting that I reinstated my insurance immediately after receiving the ticket. (This is my first offense). \n\nWhat should I anticipate at my court hearing? Can I expect a fine, or is there a possibility of a license suspension as well?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nLocation: Utah.",

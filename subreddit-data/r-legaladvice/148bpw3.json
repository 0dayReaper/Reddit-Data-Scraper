I work in hospital and I made ID cards for me and my coworkers, with the logo of hospital, name photo and our work here.\n\nI can\u2019t ask directly to the director because he is always busy.\nJust wanted to know if it\u2019s allowed for patients, like they they see better the name etc.\n\nThanks",

No one can say for certain since we don't know your country's laws nor your hospital's policies.  \n\nYou need to run this idea by whoever is in charge no matter how busy they are.",

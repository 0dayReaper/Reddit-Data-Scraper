    "postText": "I work at small bar with 10 hours shifts. We don\u2019t get lunch breaks. Recently, one of my coworkers wanted to go on a break and the owner refused. My coworker thus quit due to that refusal. The following day the owner sent out an email with a \u201cMeal Break Waiver,\u201d attached for us to sign. Basically, stating we waive our right to a meal break. Is this legal to do? I feel quite in a bind, because I need my job, but also feel out of principle I shouldn\u2019t be forced to sign a waiver that seems illegal and immoral.",

            "comment": "This needs to be reported to the Department of Labor. Such waivers can be legal, but they're part of collective bargaining (i.e. unions) and you need to get something in return. What you've described is not legal, and you have a recourse.\n\nVia [NY DOL rest &amp; break requirements](https://dol.ny.gov/day-rest-and-meal-periods):\n\n&gt;Employers in New York State must provide all employees time off for meals, after working a certain number of hours. In general, employers must provide at least 30 minutes of unpaid time off if an employee works more than 6 hours.\n\nPer the [FAQ on that same webpage](https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/03/meal-and-rest-periods-frequently-asked-questions.pdf):\n\n&gt;The New York State Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held that, in a situation where there was a collective bargaining agreement that provided for a waiver of statutory mealperiods in exchange for additional breaks and meal periods scheduled at other times, employees may waive their rights under the Labor Law. Such waivers must include the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The operational needs of the industry make strict compliance with the meal period provisions impractical  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The waiver was obtained openly and knowingly, absent of duress or coercion, through good faith negotiations  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The employees received a desired benefit through the negotiations in return for such a waiver\n\nThe [claim document](https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/04/ls223.pdf) specifically calls out no meal breaks. The DOL wants to hear from you and to defend your rights for you - it's what they do. Filing a claim is the proper way to handle this situation. It's a simple form you fill out and mail in. Keep your head down and let the DOL handle it; if you feel like you have to sign under duress, do so, but note that too on the claim. Include a copy of the waiver when submitting the claim. \n\nThe DOL can and will whip your boss into shape. It's far worse for an owner not to comply.",

                    "comment": "Depending on how the law is written, it may not even be legal to allow you to waive your meal break. I suggest you pay close attention to the very bottom...\n\n**What Are New York\u2019s Lunch and Rest Break Requirements?**\r  \nSection 162 of the New York State Labor Law  - NY employers are required to provide lunch breaks to *most* employees who work more than six hour shifts. The length of the required break depends on the industry, and the shift times that they work.\n\nNon-factory workers - 30-minute lunch break between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. if the shift is *scheduled* for at least six hours.\n\nIf the employee shift begins before 11 a.m. and ends after 7 p.m., they must receive an additional 20-minute meal break between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nIf the work shift lasts more than six hours, starting between 1 p.m. and 6 a.m., the employer must provide a lunch break in the middle of his or her shift.  (non-factory workers must receive a 45-minute break as well)\n\nEmployers do not need to pay their employees for meal breaks. Although state law does require a meal break, it does not require employers to provide shorter breaks throughout the day. An employer can provide these breaks at his or her discretion.\n\n**New York\u2019s lunch break laws apply to all public and private sector New York employers and their employees who work in the state.** In addition, the New York Department of Labor maintains that **Section 162 applies to every person working in blue collar, white collar, and managerial occupations covered by the state labor law.** This means that employers must provide meal breaks to salaried employees as well as hourly workers.\n\n***Most New York employees must take their lunch breaks and cannot opt.*** However, there are certain situations where an employee can eat without taking a break from their job duties. *First, an employee can request a waiver for the meal period* ***in exchange*** *for additional breaks and meal periods that occur at other times.*\r  \n\r  \n**For the state to recognize the waiver, the employee must meet the following criteria.**\r  \n\r  \n**The employee\u2019s industry has operational needs that makes strict compliance with the meal period laws impractical.**\n\n**The employee obtained the waiver openly and knowingly through good faith negotiations.**\n\n**The employer cannot coerce the employee into obtaining it.**\n\n**The employee received a desirable benefit through negotiations in exchange for the waiver.**",

            "comment": "Worked overnight for a medical scheduling company. They made me sign one also. I was the only person working overnight so i didnt take lunches but i had to clock out. Anyways fast forward to when i left i went to the local labor board office in my city in the state of CA and told them. Filed some paperwork and my company was fined for every day i was on the shift. I got a huge check, 10k after taxes. They had to pay me for every hour at OT rate on top of the fine lol. My friend told me that following that, they had to put two people on night shift so each can take an uninterrupted lunch and break.",

            "comment": "I worked somewhere that we signed a break waiver. It was legal in that case, because we got to leave early in exchange (worked 8-3:30, got paid for 8 hours to compensate for a 30 minute unpaid lunch and two 15 minute paid breaks) and it was for a limited time for a specific reason. What you're describing isn't legal anywhere that I know of.",

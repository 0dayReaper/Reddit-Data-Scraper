    "postText": "My partner (28m)and I (28f)are about to have a baby. He has a child with his ex(35?f) to which he was married to for five years. He also adopted her child from a previous relationship. He currently pays child support for both children and pays her spousal support. They\u2019ve been divorced for four years. The child support is garnished from his wages, however the spousal support he just send to her via cashapp. After we told her I was pregnant. She got upset, claimed he shouldn\u2019t  be making anymore kids, before taking care of the first two.She sent me a message to which she claimed she works three jobs and my fianc\u00e9s money to her is chump change\u2026 I\u2019ve never dealt with this personally, so I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s required to pay her spousal support. We live in WA, they got divorced in this state as well.",

The divorce agreement should state how long he has to pay spousal support and I hope for his sake he didn't agree to spousal support for longer than the actual marriage.\n\nAlso I wouldn't engage with the ex about the spousal or child support.  If she messages you don't respond or tell her that this is between her and your BF",

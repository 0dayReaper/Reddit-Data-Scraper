    "postText": "Today I visited my chiropractor. They told me I had to pay $100 up front to receive services. I gave them my insurance card, telling them I should have a $50 copay for it. They said they'd call my insurance to check. I sat down and a few minutes later they said I had to pay the $50 copay, and afterwards I was led into a back room to begin. After receiving services, I was then told that my insurance actually didn't cover it and I had to pay an additional $50, and that I might be sent a bill for an additional cost because the $100 was only a \"down payment\". I was only told this after I had paid the \"$50 copay\" and received services. I did have to sign some documents. What can I do against this company for being so obviously fraudulant and misleading?",

If you received services your insurance doesn't cover you need to pay for those services. You need to contact your insurance to verify whether or not this was covered and if it's subject to your deductible.",

Is there seriously no law to protect someone from a company that lies about what is covered and misleads about pricing?",

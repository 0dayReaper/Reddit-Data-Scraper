However, I was given a laptop when I started college and I was wondering if I\u2019d be legally allowed to take it with me or if it\u2019s considered my parents property since they bought it for me. I am leaving my phone and planning on getting a new one since it\u2019s under their plan but I am unsure about my laptop.",

    "postText": "I, a resident of Minnesota, had bought a product from a well known and large online retailer. It claimed to be on sale for $.01 per item, and the normal price is about $0.54 per item. I bought 16,000 items. They gave me a order confirmation, a shipping confirmation, shipped it and delivered it. They instead delivered 320 units instead of the ordered 16k units. I called, (never asked for a refund) to fix the problem. They said they would call back and never did. They simply refunded me. The issue is I am pretty set on getting the order at the price that was paid and agreed upon. I called and they said they would not do it. All I want is the order, and I am not a litigious person. But this is a fairly exceptiononal case to me. Do I even have a case here, and how would one go about pursuing this?\n\nSorry if this post if funky. I'm not in the know about how things like this go. I'll add more details if nessacary, but I felt like the subreddit is geared towards understandable vagueness. Thank you",

There's a term called \"unilateral mistake of fact\" - basically, even though you technically had an (implied) contract to buy at that price (due to how online retail works), there was a factual mistake in that contract.\n\nIf you decided you wanted to try to force the company to honor the $.01 price, you'd probably want to talk to a lawyer about planning that case out.\n\nNow, as for the units you already have, are they asking you to return them?  Pay for them?",

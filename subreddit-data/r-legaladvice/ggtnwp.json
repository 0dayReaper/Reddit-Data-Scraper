    "postText": "In June 2019 my neighbors came to my door, i had some experiences with them (they invited us for a BBQ not long after they moved in). They asked me and my wife if we would look after their pets, and their house for the next 3 weeks, as they needed to return to Taiwan as his mother was dying. They even left me $500 dollars for food for their 2 German Shepards, and their cat.\n\nI don't know what happened to them, but they just never came back. I don't know if they ended up in some sort of prison, or decided to just not come home at all. Today i found out their basement had flooded, probably sometime within the last week. Apparently a pipe burst, but the entire basement is completely fucked. I paid for have the leak fixed, and i spent all of today using my shop vac to drain their basement to the best of my abilities.\n\nBetween this and one of their dogs needing surgery i have spent several thousand dollars of my own money, and frankly the damage to the basement was pretty awful. I don't have their insurance paperwork, and don't really know if i can even do a claim for them.\n\nOn top of this his two giant German Shepards while they are amazingly good boys, it is becoming almost too much for us to handle. Their last name is extremely common, and their Facebook profiles are private. Which gives me very little avenue to tackle this down.\n\nTimeline:\n\n* June 07, 2019 - Neighbors asked me if i would look after their pets, and their house while they were handling the death of his mother back in Taiwan. Told me 3 weeks at latest.\n* July 1st, 2019 - Neighbors sent me an email stating they needed some additional time to handle his father's affairs. He apologized and said he would be back by July 15th at latest.\n* July 21st, 2019 - Sent him an email asking what was going on, explained how we were going on vacation in August. Never got a response.\n* July 31st, 2019 - Tried calling him on his cellphone, # he was given to me was no longer in service.\n* August 14th, 2019 - Went on vacation, had my brother look after all 4 dogs, for the next week.\n* September 2nd, 2019 - Emailed him again, no response.\n* September 3rd, 2019 - Tried to reach him and his wife via Facebook using the private message feature.\n* September 6th, 2019 - Ended up moving his 2 dogs, 1 cat into our house as they seemed extremely miserable. I ended up disassembling part of our adjoined fence to allow his dogs to use their outdoor area.\n* November 19th, 2019 - One of his dogs started showing signs of being ill, brought him to the vet turns out he is suffering from a medium severity case of IVDD. He ended up requiring surgery which we paid for.\n* January 21st, 2020 - Sent another email and never got a response.\n* Today - When i was bringing his mail in to his house, i noticed it smelled pretty awful and i quickly discovered his basement had about a foot of water in it.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* What exactly is my level of responsibility in this. I agreed to look after it for a few weeks/couple of months at the most. It has almost been a year now.\n* Is there anything i can do?\n\n**Location: Ontario, Canada**\n\nSorry some other points:\n\n* I am assuming they have some sort of auto payment for bills setup, because they still have hydro/cable/internet.\n* I am unsure where exactly the husband worked, i know he said he was an engineer, however i cannot find his linked in profile, so i don't know what company.\n* Their last name is a very common name (common like Wong), which gives me tons of facebook results.

IANAL but one thing I would add is that even if you\u2019re getting no response, continue to send email updates to your neighbours. It\u2019ll keep a paper trail of your attempts to contact them and may help if you end up taking them to small claims court for the money you\u2019ve spent whilst they\u2019ve been away. \n\nIt may be worth enabling read receipts on these emails. This will at least tell you and the police if they\u2019re reading and ignoring your messages, or if they\u2019re not being read at all (which may point at something more sinister having taken place). \n\nIf not done so already, I would also start collating bills, bank statements, correspondence with vets and plumbers which show the money you have spent on their property and animals. Make a note of any maintenance work you\u2019ve done to keep the property in order such as gardening or use of your shop vac - how long have you spent doing this, what dates this has been done on, have you had to purchase additional supplies to complete the basic maintenance. I would also include copies of any email contact you had or continue to have with them. Having this organised and in one binder now will put you in a good position later on and maintain a clear timeline.",

Typically there's the mortgage name and return address on the upper corner of the envelope, you could just Google and then call the phone number. They wouldn't give you any information, but they might be willing to contact the owners, especially when they hear the house has been flooded. Police would most likely just say it's a \"civil\" matter and won't do much without proof of criminal laws being broken, and maybe file a missing persons report. It wouldn't hurt to try multiple things, trying to get in contact with the owners, to resolve this issue ASAP. OP head gone WAY above IMO.",

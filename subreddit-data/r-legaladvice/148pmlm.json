    "postText": "A relative was fired from Walmart about a year ago for improper stopping of a shoplifter. Apparently it\u2019s against Wally\u2019s policy to approach after they have gone into the bathroom. However the real story behind this is a suspicious agism. The person who was fired had the wrong birthdate entered into the Wally system, they had it as 10 years younger than they\u2019re actual age. This person had discovered this and was attempting to get that rectified because they were planning on retiring in 3 years and didn\u2019t want Wally to say that they had improperly represented themselves. After starting this process all of the sudden they were fired for the shoplifting issue, which they had done many times in the past and no one had ever reprimanded them for it. There was no reprimand, just an immediate firing. So no retirement. Does this sound like a good lawsuit? Do you know of any lawyers willing to take on Wally?",

Most private companies have a 401k or something similar. \n\n&gt;Does this sound like a good lawsuit? \n\nNot really, but it's impossible to know without all the facts. \n\n&gt;Do you know of any lawyers willing to take on Wally?\n\nMost any plaintiff's employment lawyer would be delighted to go after Walmart if there's a viable case to be made.",

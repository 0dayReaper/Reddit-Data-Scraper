    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I are planning a marriage for next year in Pittsburgh, PA.  We are planning on each adopting a new last name, rather than taking one party\u2019s or hyphenating.  Is this possible to effectuate through the regular process of obtaining a marriage certificate in PA or will we need to go through the process of a court ordered name change?\n\nApologies if this has been asked before, I searched the mega thread and prior posts and couldn\u2019t find anything applicable.",

I\u2019ll call him \u201cD.\u201d\n\nGiven the initial evidence, what are the most serious charges D could face in Ohio?\n\nD has several prior misdemeanors for domestic abuse, DUI, drugs, and theft.  He also had 2 separate warrants out (car theft) during this incident. \n\nThe following summary of his latest arrest is from victim\u2019s public statements/security camera + the police report:\n\n     \u2026As part of an ongoing dispute with the victim, D was repeatedly going to his house to smashup windows/victim\u2019s car while making threats.  On the FOURTH time this happened, police were called and D fled before they arrived. \n\nAs police were finishing the call, D returned with his girlfriend in a stolen car. They sped off and surrendered a while later. \n\nDuring arrest, D had coke and meth in his pants and a road flare in his lap.  He had the hammer and bat he used to make the threats in the car, along with a mostly full gas canister, and empty beer bottles. One of the beer bottles was filled with gas and had a rag stuffed in the top.\n\n\u2026Does the state have a case for attempted arson? \n\nWhat generally happens in cases like this?",

Is there an angle you're particular concerned about that an arson charge is more prominent in your mind than *two* warrants for car theft, slam dunk drug charges, open containers (plural), and the molotov itself [which may be a destructive device](https://www.atf.gov/explosives/illegal-explosives)?",

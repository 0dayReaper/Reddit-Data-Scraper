    "postText": "I was stopped for speeding back in 2020 and I never received a court date in the mail because I moved the day before I was stopped, so my address wasn\u2019t updated on my license and I guess the mail got lost, by the time I got anything regarding the ticket it was already past the court date and now I have a bench warrant for it. Will I get arrested for showing up to take care of it? I can\u2019t afford to miss work and have been putting it off because I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll arrest me and keep me until my court date. I live in Louisiana.",

            "comment": "Best outcome - call an attorney in the state where the warrant is issued and speak to them about quashing it. You may not need to travel or make an appearance yourself, especially if it's not a felony. This will cost you money.\n\nSelf-help outcome - call the clerk at the courthouse you were supposed to appear at and ask about scheduling a hearing and turning yourself in (usually called a 'court surrender'). Go to the appearance, bring all of your evidence about your move, explain what happened to the judge, try to be contrite and hope they will allow you to pay a fine and move on with your life.\n\nYou should be able to schedule an appearance so as to avoid an arrest, since you'll already be at the courthouse, but it all depends on their particular procedures.",

I missed the date because I was out of town training at a new job. I got strip searched and everything even though my bail was already paid. Don\u2019t put it off! It was a total nightmare, and I nearly lost my job because I couldn\u2019t call in. \n\nOn the bright side, the judge was very sympathetic and looked horrified when she found out I had \u201cdone time\u201d for my crime.",

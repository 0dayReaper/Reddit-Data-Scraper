    "postText": "I\u2019ve been working for a papa John\u2019s in Alabama for two years. Today I found out I make 25 cents less than another driver who started the same time as me, and not only that but he was given a raise a year after he started, and I was only raised from 9.00 to 10.25 a few months ago. It\u2019s a right to work state. If they don\u2019t agree to give me back pay what are my options?\n\nEdit: I like this job, and if I started a new one now I would be making even less. I consider quitting an option but not my first one, so please give me steps I can take before quitting. Also, my boyfriend worked a job where employees received backpay, so it is a possibility in this state.",

There are lots of valid reasons for pay discrepancies.  They don't need a valid reason; they just need not to have the discrepancy for an unlawful reasons.",

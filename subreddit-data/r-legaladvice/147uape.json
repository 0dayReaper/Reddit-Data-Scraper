    "postText": "I have a few questions about how legal guardianship works in a will:\n\n-Is there a way to select a legal guardian for my child with the condition that they move into or near my home in order to gain custody? The guardians I would choose live far away, and I'd like my child to stay where they feel comfortable and established.\n\n-If my husband and I make separate wills with conflicting guardianship wishes and we both pass away, how will guardianship be decided?\n\nPS - If this isn't the right place to post this, please let me know!",

I know you think it would be better for your child to stay in the same place but if something happens to you and/or your spouse all bets are off.   Circumstances change when loss happens and living in the same place and expecting it to be the same as it was prior to the loss is just naive.  \n\nChoose the best person someone you trust making the best decisions for your child.   They aren\u2019t going to raise your kid like you will.  They aren\u2019t you.   They will be left picking up pieces.   If you trust them with your kid.  Trust them to make the decisions.",

I assumed having a constant (like a location) would bring comfort, but I can also see where that would just be a painful environment. I wouldn't expect everything to be normal after a loss, but uprooting everything didn't seem right before reading your comment.\n\nI appreciate your advice in trusting the people I choose regardless of if they'll parent just like me. This has been a really tough thing to think about because, of course in an ideal world, I'd love to make things exactly right for my child if I were gone. I guess I need to try to have a more realistic perspective moving forward in this process.",

    "postText": "I signed a contract with a general contractor to do a specialty install at 12 houses. We are not finished with the first one and we are way over budget. They have made it impossible to be successful by delaying start date a year,  week by week.\nBad management, bad design, other trades in the way, \nBad materials, now hostile work environment.\nI want to quit so bad but I signed a bad contract that says I have to pay for any overages if I defaulted on the contract.  What are my chances of having to pay for damages? I have an LLC and I\u2019m the subcontractor. There are no attorneys available near me\u2026",

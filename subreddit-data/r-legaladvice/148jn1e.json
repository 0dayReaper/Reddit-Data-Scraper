    "postText": "Tesco in the UK (England) has just started a new policy where, when you pay for petrol, it takes \u00a3120 from your bank account and then will refund the difference within 48 hours. How can this be legal? My mum went to pay for \u00a315 of petrol only to them have a notification claiming unauthorized overdraft. Is there anything that can be done here as this has already caused issues for us.",

    "postText": "Throw away due to unique details of case. Omaha, Nebraska. Recently moved into duplex which is one of 5 on a block owned by the same property management company. It's just one guy and his assistant, not anything large or super official.\n\nMy building has 3 floors. We toured both sides before choosing the one we're in now. Other side has access/possession of all 3 floors in the lease. Ours only includes main and second floor. The unit was chopped up in a way that our basement is only accessible by a padlocked door on the exterior of the house, next to ours. Our HVAC, water heater, and breaker box are down there. They use that space for maintainance work and storage (several days a week I hear the maintenance guy hammering away down there). We were not told that the basement was used for such purposes, but that's a different complaint. When they redesigned the floor plan, they left a gaping hole in the floor trim so I can see in the basement. The light is on 24/7, it has never been turned off since we've lived here. I have an infant and am up all hours of the day and night so I am sure it's always on.\n\nWas irritated enough with our home being used as a workshop without forward notice, but when I noticed the light always on, I wondered who's footing that bill. On our building there are only two meter boxes (ours and one for the other half of the building/neighbors). Based on this, I'm assuming that we're the ones paying for that light to always be on and all the power tools being used down there.\n\nHow do I verify I'm right, and (if I'm right) address this with the owner without causing a rift?\n\nSeparate issue to maybe address at the same time: I can't make clear of our city/state laws on access to breaker box. From what I read it says tenant either has access to it or a 24/7 maintenance guy available, we have neither, but I'm not sure if that's a law or a suggestion.\n\nETA: All utilities are in my name.",

            "comment": "The first thing to do is politely ask the landlord who's paying for the power in the basement. (While a single light being on isn't going to affect the bill much, using that space to run power tools definitely will. So you have a very valid concern.)\n\nIf the electric bill is in your name you could voice your concern someone else is using your power to the utility company. Otherwise, if it's in the landlord's name, per NE law the landlord must provide you with a written explanation of your utility charges.",

Would it be better to talk to my utility company first or landlord? Landlord I can only talk to through his early 20s year old assistant who we've had issues getting clear messages back and forth. We're not allowed nor have the contact information to speak to the landlord directly.",

They rewire the basement and have a new meter put on the building? They take over utilities and have us pay them whatever portion we're using? I want to have something in my pocket when I meet with them so I can ensure the problem is resolved and not just expect it to be fixed, you know?",

The damages are probably less than that based on your description. Consider how long you plan to live there, because you will have a relationship with these people for that duration.",

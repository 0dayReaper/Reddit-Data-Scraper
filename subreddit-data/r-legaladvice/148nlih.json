    "postText": "Today I opened my mailbox to find a Notice to Quit from my apartment complex. The exact words in the title are \"Notice to Quit Rules and Regulation Modification No Smoking Addendum\" and immediately I went into a panic attack. I have very little understanding of legal wording and I'm quite frankly, an idiot, so I need all the help I can get. \n\nFrom what little understanding I have, they are telling me to quit smoking, specifically THC in the apartment, (I'm from New Jersey, it is legal here)\n\nOriginally I saw nothing about smoking on the original lease, and all of this seems new. \n\nMost of it is about secondhand THC, which makes me think that someone nearby complained about a smell I may have accidentally slip by, (I'm usually pretty careful and try not to let the smell get out of hand). And for clarification, I also vape nicotine, but vapes are not mentioned at all in the paper work, but I'm wondering if they think of that as smoking too, as I have done that outside while walking the dogs, though never around anyone. \n\nDoing whatever research I could, not that I truly understand, but it was said online is that a notice to cease must first be given, to which I never received. \n\nThe wording at the end I'll quote, cause that's what I need help with the most. I'm mostly wondering if they are just telling me to quit, or if it's just new rules being added on. Is this directed at me personally, or did they change everyone's lease rules. \n\n\"Your rules and regulations are being modified as follows:\n\nThe landlord is changing rules and regulations to prohibit smoking of any substance inside the building or common areas. You can smoke on your deck. If medical marijuana is required, you can use edibles.\n\n(Now this is where I really got confused)\n\nYou have a choice. You can surrender possession pursuant to this Notice to Quit which you are hereby being given, or in the alternative, you may stay and remain in possession of the premises; but if you stay and remain in possession, you will be deemed by operation of law to have accepted all changes of the terms of your tenancy relationship which are presented by this new form lease rules and regulations. You have 30 days from the date of this notice to quit and cease smoking of any substance inside the building or common or within 20 feet of the building or common areas.\"\n\nOf course the 30 days was marked for May 23rd, only giving me 10 days to figure out how to change everything. \n\nObviously I'm not exactly happy about any of this, and renters always have what appears to be no God damn rights whatsoever, I'm just trying to understand everything. \n\nI'm guessing in the end it means stop smoking anywhere in the vicinity of the building, with possibly the exception of my \"deck\" (if you can even call it that, more of a first floor crappy balcony), but I honestly can't tell if they mean only tabaco on the deck, or I can smoke THC on the deck. \n\nPlease, any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm generally an idiot with most things in life, but with this I feel even more damn confused. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "They are bound by the original contract as it was written. They are trying to change that contract by adding a new condition. As a legal matter, yes, you could litigate this if they evict you in the future. Whether that would be successful depends on a lot of factors that aren\u2019t knowable here.\n\nAs a practical matter, it would almost certainly be easier to just start smoking only on the deck, and if you are vaping and for some reason cannot vape exclusively outside, try to minimize it or do it in the area of an air purifier or something along those lines (to mitigate any aroma).",

Yes, I'm very much trying to go with the easiest of options here, that's why I'm trying to figure it all out before doing anything. \n\nDo you think they mean by this I can smoke cannabis on the deck? The language is confusing in that manner with the whole 20 feet from common areas thing, all the decks are right next to each other, and the smell and second hand smoke will definitely travel a lot more out there, it's why I was scared to smoke out there in the first place. I do think this whole thing is much more directed at my cannabis smoke than my vape, considering they never mention vape at all, but I will refrain from vaping outside while walking dogs or walking to my car to avoid any other issues. \n\nKnowing me, and probably what I should do at this point is switch to edibles, which kind of really sucks cause I definitely prefer a smoke, but at least I have options there.",

If they don't like your behavior wrt marijuana (regardless of laws) they may try to evict you, and if you are 100% legal in your usage, then I think you'd have a pretty strong case that they cannot evict you because the lease doesn't say no smoking. But it will be a pain to get to the point where you argue that in court, and they can also try all kinds of other shady tactics aside from the bullshit new clause, like disturbing quiet enjoyment, alleging crimes in the unit, causing a health hazard, etc. Depends on your local judges how they would feel about their allegations there, but it is a risk you could be evicted for something you didn't do, simply because they don't like you and are good liars. So it'll be a good idea to be on good behavior, minimize odors and smoke, etc. Do it outside as much as you can. Basically, you have legal rights here but it might be a pain to exercise them to prevent an eviction.",

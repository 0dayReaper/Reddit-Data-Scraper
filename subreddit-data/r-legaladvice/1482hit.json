    "postText": "Got in an accident in April I was trying to merge to the right lane and other driver entering turning lane as I\u2019m merging and we collided cop cited me a ticket and his insurance company deemed me at fault which in my personal opinion I believe 50/50 fault he claim he was trying to make a call so I\u2019d assume he was distracted and hadn\u2019t seen my trying to merge. Anyways I was pulled over and told my license and as suspended ( FR PIP crash) basically I have to pay the guy 2,000 to reinstate my license :\u2019( to be fair I hadn\u2019t known at all I was uninsured at the time of the crash since I was under my mom\u2019s policy and it was canceled. Guy claims he\u2019s having shoulder and knee pain from the accident but walking fine after I asked him for documentation of his hospital visit he tired to dodge the question also claims the damage to his 2019 Hyundai is 21,000$ and the only damage to his car is a slight dent to the driver door his insurance company hasn\u2019t contacted me but is there anyway to prove 50/50 fault I believe we both made a mistake it was clear as day I was trying to merge my car was even half way in the lane when he passed through any advice? I\u2019m also in Florida",

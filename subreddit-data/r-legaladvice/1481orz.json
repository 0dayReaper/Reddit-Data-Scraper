    "postText": "So tldr back story backstory i work with this guy and he  is a bit of a drunk. He lives right across the street from me and is constantly over at my house. At first i didn\u2019t mind hanging out with the guy because he was kinda cool, he is older than me and had a lot of wisdom. It got out of hand very quickly, the guy was over everyday and when he\u2019s very drunk he is a very loud, annoying and sometimes confrontational.  He would constantly call and text me, come over knock on my windows and doors until i opened.\n\nSo the night of the incident i wasn\u2019t home due to hanging out with other friends out of town. My co worker comes to my house late that night while im on the way home and begins knocking. I assume he knocked for a while and then he called me. I didn\u2019t answer but he left a voicemail along the lines of \u201c the laws coming and hells coming with it.\u201d  (He was absolutely plastered.) He then proceeded to call the police and ask for a welfare check even though i had seen him literally the previous day and gave no indication of anything that would require a welfare check. I then arrived home to him on the sidewalk to him yelling and screaming in his usual gibberish manner. I approached to ask why he had called the police. He was very confrontational. He\u2019s been like this before so i put my hand on his shoulder in an attempt to usher him inside to avoid waking neighbors and causing a scene. He then pulled a knife and put a 4 inch wide 1 inch deep gash in my side and a half in stab wound right below. I pushed him away and he replied \u201chow you like that bitch?\u201d I then ran and he also ran back to his house. ( i wanna add another small piece of info: my co worker is a felon, he did 10 years for armed robbery in the 90s. He also happens to be in possession of a shotgun. Illegally of course.) Once i saw him run for the house i suspected he may be going for that so i retread two blocks and called the police my self. They arrived and arrest him as he belligerently struggled and screamed. I retrieved treatment at the hospital that night. 8 staples and a tetanus shot. He was charged with Malicious Assault-1\n\nFast forward to today, i go to work to inform them of the incident. ( i work for a Dining Service Company for a University it\u2019s probably the one your thinking of) I walk in and am met by my managers and the campus police. I was informed that i am suspended until the court case is over may be fired , and am not allowed on the campus.\n\nIs this legal? I feel like i as the victim of a fucking stabbing shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. Especially since my coworker is known around town as a crazy drunk and ALLEGEDLY has come to work drunk and been sent home by the managers and again i say allegedly.\n\nAny help is appreciated\n\nThis happened in WV, USA",

What has your work heard? If you have not had your side presented perhaps they heard a story from your coworker and are purely acting off that?",

    "postText": "I applied and opened a credit card for care credit for medical/vet bills. When I applied, I used, my legal name that has been changed for a year and half. It was changed through the DMV and Social Security January of 2022. The company changed the name to my old name without speaking to me first. \n\nWhen I called them to have them change it to my legal name they first tried to transfer me to the fraud department. I told them, it's not fraud (yet) they just need to change the name in the system. \n\nThe same person (never spoke to fraud) came back on and said they will only change it if I mail a copy of my license to a P. O. Box. \n\n1) I am not mailing a pic of my license through the mail at all, especially to a P. O. Box. I have very little trust that something won't happen. \n\n2) The company is the one that changed the name, claiming that that is the name that the credit bureaus have. The problem with this claim is not only did I double check the credit bureaus and they have the correct name, I have several credit cards with the correct name and haven't had this issue before. \n\n\nHere's my question: Since they won't make attempts (again, not mailing personal info to a P. O. Box) to correct their mistake, am I legally responsible for any debt on the card? At least until they correct their mistake. I'm not saying that I'm gonna run up the card or anything, I just don't feel that since they won't fix it, I shouldn't have to pay something that isn't in my name.",

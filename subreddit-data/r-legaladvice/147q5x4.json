    "postText": "We're in Massachusetts, USA.\n\nWe hired a contractor a couple years ago to replace our roof, since it was old and had a lot of storm damage. He was a small time guy, we were new homeowners, and we thought all this was settled with a simple contract.\n\nFast forward to now, and we suddenly had water pouring back into the house again, in the same damn places. We got other roofers to look at it, and turns out that he did a horrid job with the roof and we needed to replace the whole damn thing *again.* Extensive picture evidence of the bad work he did -- 18 pages of roof report on everything he fucked up. There was no storm damage from the recent incident, it was all craftsmanship stuff, so we were up a creek regarding insurance. They don't cover \"your repair guy is horrible.\"\n\nSo I looked up his registration number recently, and according to MA records, it was expired at the time he did the work. We're out like 25,000 for the whole roof replacement. Do we have a case against this guy, like should we even try? Or is this just \"caveat emptor, you should've known he was skeevy, fuck you\"?\n\nWe asked him about insurance for his work, he says he has it, but he's now mad that we didn't call *him* to fix the issues (that he caused) and won't talk to us. What can we do?",

All said and done I was out my lawyer fees (which was about $2500) and everything else was covered. Not perfect but his insurance had to pay me $14k so I guarantee his rates were jacked after that.",

            "comment": "Ideally, you would want to look up the contractor's license prior to signing a contract, not after the work is done.  In the future, don't hire an unlicensed contractor.  I would stop communicating with that person, and file a complaint with the MA Office of Consumer Affairs:\n\nhttps://www.mass.gov/how-to/file-a-complaint-against-a-home-improvement-contractor#what-you-need\n\nThe amount of money you're out likely exceeds the small claims limit in your state.  You may want to contact a lawyer to see if it's worth pursuing in court.  Regardless of what they told you, if this person doesn't have a valid license it's doubtful they are actually insured.  \n\nOne option might be to file a claim for the maximum allowed small claims court limit. At least this way you have at least a chance of recovering something without the need for a lawyer.  \n\nGood luck! (I am not a lawyer.)",

He was a local handyman that had done a bunch of work in the area, and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg...it is what it is.\n\nI already looked at that, and if his license was expired, there's nothing a complaint is going to do. I guess there's not much more to say than \"ask an actual in person lawyer.\"",

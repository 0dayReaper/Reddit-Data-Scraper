    "postText": "Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.\n\nI was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).\n\nSo then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.\n\nWhen he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a \"sorry, computer error you are free to go\" and I was released.\n\nWhat can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.\n\nEDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told \"good luck\". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",

He could, however, get back pay from the employer if the employer did something wrong, but that doesn't appear to be the case here. Seems like the employer fired him for no call no show for 60 days. That's also statutory misconduct under UI law, but hopefully the circumstances in this case will overcome that. \n\nP. S. Hello fellow Madison lawyer who's also up way too early in the am.

I didn't really think about it until a few min after posting, although I should have since I've done a ton of UI cases and volunteer at the UI clinic (it's early and I barely slept lol). I think if he did everything he possibly could to reach the employer but was unable, he may have a shot. I mean, if someone is kidnapped or goes into a coma, they can't really expect proper call-in procedures. The statute is pretty clear here, but misconduct still requires some intent, I would argue.*\n\n\nhttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/108/04/5/e\n\nEdit*",

I\u2019ve had it happen once, where a defendant had his private attorney convinced that it was a case of mistaken identity. That someone gave the officer his name and address instead, so they sent him the summons and arrested him when he didn\u2019t show up to court. \n\nWe took his prints and compared them to the ones taken the night the notice to appear was given. They matched. Defense still argues it was not him. Then I showed them the video with a clear shot of his face. \n\nThe DA hears that excuse all the time. The PD needed to find the proof and present it. It should not have taken two months for a PD to meet with their client. But they were 100% right to not make argument at the initial appearance, because procedurally you don\u2019t argue at that stage. But the PD should have been with him the next day. I have a great working relationship with my PDs and I know they don\u2019t take that long to meet with clients because they usually have motions written up (or other similar actions) before the file ever even makes its way to my office. \n\nI think this mistake falls on the police department and PD.

Personally, I don't find that to be acceptable cosmically, but it does mitigate the liability. If that's the case I'd rather blame and fix inefficiencies in the system than those within it.\n\nWithout more info it's hard to say. I still feel it violated rights at a fundamental level and the state should do something to help salvage the guys life, but I can't say I know enough to correct or condemn anyone if they genuinely had no other info.

The problem is that none of these system are really interconnected.  Yes, there is AFIS to check fingerprints(if its working, it goes down a lot), but that doesn\u2019t give a criminal history, it just gives a name/DOB.  Then you have to run that name DOB through NCIC and state level records check.  There are also non-computerized records you have to request to have mailed, if you\u2019re so inclined.  The databases are ancient systems-think black screen with all green letters, no mouse capabilities, tab through every field, typing a \u201c.\u201d for some reason confuses the hell out of the computer.  The main screen has a copyright date of 1987.  Now, when you do a search, it doesn\u2019t print out just that person, it prints out \u201csound alikes\u201d.  It uses some algorithm to get every possible person it could be and gives you their record.  No pictures, just general descriptors and charges.

There\u2019s a lot of overlap in that practice area with a general plaintiff\u2019s personal injury practice or even criminal defense, so don\u2019t be thrown if lawyers you\u2019re considering do a mix. Initial consultations are typically free. A lawyer that practices this type of law in your area will be in the best position to tell you what options are available, which may include bringing a lawsuit on your behalf. You should meet with several before you choose which lawyer to work with. Ask questions about similar cases they\u2019ve handled and don\u2019t work with someone who\u2019s never handled a case anything like this before. You may end up working with your lawyer for over a year, so take your time making the decision. \n\nThis is an absolutely horrific story. I am so sorry this happened to you and I hope that you find someone to help you figure out what your options are. Good luck. ",

They probably only have claim to / care about the vehicle itself.\n\nIt may also be worth investigating how the auction process works. It is possible that the underlying business model is designed to make a profit from short periods of \"storage\" &amp; the purpose of the auction is simply to get rid of unclaimed vehicles to make room for new arrivals. As such, it may be cheaper for you to buy the car back at auction than to pay the fees at this point. I would assume that many cars going through this process have a questionable history, which will depress their value at auction; you have an advantage when bidding for your own car, because you know its history. \n\n*I would investigate the auction process via a Google search rather than asking somebody from the towing company in-person* because it's almost certain that they would rather take the guaranteed income from the fee now than the uncertain (possibly lower) income from the auction later, &amp; will therefore seek to discourage / prevent you from taking this path. (I would expect that they will use an external auctioneer, who probably won't care who buys the cars provided that they've got the money.)\n\n**Keep receipts** for any expenses you incur as a result of this case, as they will form part of your eventual claim.

A defendant can serve their sentence, discover new evidence later and file an appeal under habeas to get a conviction overturned.  The risk is having the case overturned and the DA pursuing the original charges which stay in place til dismissed or dropped. \n\nIAC is a basis for criminal appeal. IAC can be the basis of a tort if the defendant was damaged by the actions of the attorney which fell below the standards of legal representation in the state in question.\n\nIn this case, spending 60days in jail bc the attorney wouldn\u2019t bother to validate OP\u2019s claim of mistaken identity is likely to lead to a civil judgement of significant amount.

I\u2019m just glancing over the law in Wisconsin but I am thinking you must have waived your preliminary examination? Do you remember anyone asking whether or not you wanted one when you were arraigned? According to Criminal Procedure Law 970.03, in Wisconsin, it should take place within 10 days if you are remanded and bail is set higher than $500. If everything you have said about your case is true, it seems like having a prelim may have been the right strategy in this case, but I really can\u2019t say for sure. To put it very briefly, the prelim is basically a hearing to show whether or not there\u2019s probable cause that you committed a felony.\n\nFYI, from the perspective of a PD, there are very rarely good enough reasons for people to have a prelim. The DA in my county is a dick about it, gives no discovery beforehand, and frequently immediately indicts people immediately after if they lose. Based on what you\u2019re saying, though, seems like your case it was probably appropriate. \n\nWas there ever any talk that you were going to be indicted? \n\nWas bail set and if so what was it?\n\nWith all that being said it\u2019s entirely possible that the PD was basing his decisions on strategy. I don\u2019t know the timing issues in Wisconsin as far as indictments go but he might\u2019ve just been running out the clock \u2014 here in New York, once a D waives his prelim, the DA then has 45 days to indict or the attorney can file a motion to have him released from jail. It\u2019s possible that something similar exists there and your attorney didn\u2019t want to \u201crock the boat\u201d so to speak \u2014 and thought that if he just let things slide (and hope the DA would forget about things) maybe he could get your case resolved without an indictment.

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "Location: Texas\n\nI understand that a landlord needs to provide action when a roach problem occurs. Our landlord has been pretty proactive on hiring an exterminator weekly. However, the roaches keep coming back. Ive run myself ragged cleaning this unit and keeping it tidy, but somehow, the roaches just. wont. quit.\n\nThings are tense with my landlord now, as shes pointing a finger at me for not being clean. But i swear i make this place SPOTLESS on the daily. Its becoming exhausting. i cant spend 6 hours a day every day cleaning and then pack up all my food and clothes for the exterminator once a week every week.\n\nWhat can i do? i understand under texas law, if a landlord doesnt repair a problem (this includes rats and roaches https://texaslawhelp.org/article/right-to-repairs-as-a-tenant ) then legally we may terminate the lease. \n\nThe grey area here is that the landlord IS making an effort to fix the issue, but regardless of what we both do (and god knows im trying), the roaches remain. Can i break lease over this issue?",

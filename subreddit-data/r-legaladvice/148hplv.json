    "postText": "I work as an outside sales rep for a pest control company. I am 100% commission. During the hiring process I was repeatedly told I could easily make $100k a year and that I would get a minimum of 5 leads per day. I first noticed an issue with the operation when I had several days scheduled with only 2 or 3 leads. There were also days where I had 5 or 6 leads but upon further inspection a number of those leads were actually service issues that were scheduled wrong. Starting in April they divided our sales territories into equal areas based on monthly dollar values and arranged them according to zip codes. I noticed fairly quick that I was not being scheduled in my territory. I thought at first that maybe there were no leads coming in and they were filling my schedule with what they had. We are suppose to alert the office of new sales via group text and include the address. I noticed that sales were being made in my territory on days where I was scheduled outside of it. I was told by our manager that leads are scheduled on who has availability on their schedule and that some leads may be allocated to other reps if our schedules are full. We have no control over this allotment. There were days where I was overbooked with sales outside of my territory and some sales were scheduled elsewhere. But when I started to track all of my leads and compare them to the sales that other reps made in my territory I found out that it was happening every day and that the territories I was given were of lesser value than the one I was designated. In the month of May alone a single rep sold over $22k inside of my territory. There were days where multiple sales were made in my areas while I had only a few leads that were outside of my designated territory. Our manager receives leads from technicians as well which are suppose to be delegated to the proper rep for that zip code. On multiple occasions leads were given to one particular rep and not the rightful one. I even had confirmed sales scheduled for payment moved from my schedule and put on other reps. There has to be some sort of protection from this. Without transparency from my employer on all of the incoming leads I have no way of determining how much opportunity is being mismanaged. Anyone familiar with law or how to approach this? I am seeking employment elsewhere and will be resigning my position asap because a can no longer afford to work there, I am behind on bills as a result of the two months this occurred",

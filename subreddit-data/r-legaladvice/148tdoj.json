    "postText": "Quick run down: grandma has a will back in 1995, written for the siblings equally divided the estate on the parcel she lives at with my dad the executive. 2009 she filed a quit claim deed of the parcel and another land parcel. The land parcel sold last month before her passing last week, all the funds went into her account to pay off the remaining of the loans and bills. None of the remaining went into my dads account unfortunately before she passed. \nIs he going to be entitled to those funds for the parcel on the deed, or since all the funds are in her bank account it\u2019s equally divided to the siblings as in the will?",

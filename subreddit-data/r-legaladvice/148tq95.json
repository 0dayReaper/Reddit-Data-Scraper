    "postText": "I moved into a Philly apartment June 1st. I moved in without seeing the place in person (dumb, I know. hindsight is 2020). The oven was broken upon arrival, so submitted both a maintenance request and texted my landlord. One week later, I reminded him and it\u2019s still not fixed. I\u2019m so annoyed because I can\u2019t cook meals. I put down a security deposit totaling 2 months rent. \n\nI looked up my address and it turns out the building\u2019s rental license expired 2 years ago. Can I move out because of this or use this as leverage? Thank you!",

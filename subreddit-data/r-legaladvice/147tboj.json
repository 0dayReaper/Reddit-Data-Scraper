    "postText": "My partner became very ill about 2 1/2 years ago with a mystery illness/condition that doctors couldn't figure out. She manages an animal hospital and when this first started she had the building at work tested for mold. The report she received stated that there is mold, that 1/3 of the air quality in the building was deemed safe and that remediations needed to be done in order to fix it. Well fast forward to last week when she was officially diagnosed with mold toxicity after hundreds of doctors visits, procedures, time off work to go to these appointments, etc.\n\nHer company rents the building and she made her higher up's as well as the building owner aware of this issue 2 1/2 years ago when it was tested and they never did anything to fix it, the landlord/owner buried the report. She cannot return to work because she is detoxing from the mold and can't risk getting sick again. The mold is still there, just even worse now.\n\nWhat steps should we take in order to fight this? We are completely lost in where to start/do. She is being tested this Wednesday to prove that the type of mold she got sick from is in fact the same mold in the building.\n\nUpdate: Location is North Carolina",

If it\u2019s a serious enough danger, she may have a right to [stop working](https://www.osha.gov/workers/right-to-refuse). The requirements are:\n\n&gt;Where possible, you have asked the employer to eliminate the danger, and the employer failed to do so; and\n\n&gt;You refused to work in \"good faith.\" This means that you must genuinely believe that an imminent danger exists; and\n\n&gt;A reasonable person would agree that there is a real danger of death or serious injury; and\n\n&gt;There isn't enough time, due to the urgency of the hazard, to get it corrected through regular enforcement channels, such as requesting an OSHA inspection.\n\nBased off of what you\u2019ve written here, I would say there\u2019s more than enough evidence for your wife to implement stop work authority.\n\nNow as for the workman\u2019s comp stuff and reimbursement for your medical costs, I can\u2019t speak to that. But filing a formal complaint with OSHA might be a good first step to at least establish violations on the part of her employer, and get her connected with resources",

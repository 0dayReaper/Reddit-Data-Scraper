    "postText": "Hi everyone, I just bought my first home and we had a 30 day closing and a 30 day rent back, but closing got pushed due to seller not being able to fix the septic issues in time. the day finally came and we did our final walkthrough, she had taken our fridge, washer, and dryer. My realtor has been really helpful and is trying to figure this out but they already said they refuse to return the appliances and refuse to pay the cost of brand new appliances. I\u2019m 19 and this is all very stressful for me, the seller has already been very difficult to work with but I need a fridge\u2026 my realtor said she\u2019s talking with her broker to try to sort it out but i\u2019m a little worried i\u2019ll need a lawyer. any advice?\nedit: our agreement includes appliances.\n\nupdate: it was the sellers agents fault, he told them they could take the appliances and our contract states that the home came with all appliances with no exceptions. My realtors are calling his broker and  he will be responsible for replacing our appliances with comparable ones, delivered and installed in an appropriate amount of time. the sellers had no idea they couldn\u2019t take the appliances. the agent was telling us he was so embarrassed and couldn\u2019t believe his clients would do something like that then when my realtor threw out calling the cops for theft he told the truth. it all will work out!",

Going forward, they can agree to put appliances back or replace them. However, unless you have photos or serial numbers, they pretty much can put any working condition appliance in. \n\nIf funds have been released, after you inquired about missing appliances, then the Lawyer &amp; their firm who turned over funds, without contract terms being fulfilled, also now bare liability also for not doing due diligence. You may be able to ask for loss of use of your new home because the kitchen was rendered unusable for daily living. So costs for take out/extra costs for lost food or convince or any actual costs involved in not have a functional kitchen\n\n\nLawyers and Realtors have legal obligations in this matter to ensure ALL terms are agreed upon and met on completion of sale. The sale funds must be held in trust and not released until all those are met. If the funds were released without due diligence by both sides of Lawyers &amp; Realtors or by previous owner  to meet those terms, you have cases against all of them, they may go beyond just cost of appliances. They also can be fined or have licenses revoked and the agency they work for held accountable also. This is contract law. You may need another Lawyer. \n\nMake sure EVERYTHING you noted that is missing, is in writing and video/pictures. Also, send in writing or email a summary of what has taken place. Ie: when you noticed appliances were missing, what brand/condition/kinds off appliances were there when you viewed home 1st time, who did you speak to, when you spoke to them and what was discussed or offered as solution. Do it as a 'clarifying' inquiry to establish what has happened so far. Your phone has a camera.. pictures are important - even of the empty spaces they were supposed to be in. \nIf you have law where 1 arty consent on recording, record all phone calls and conversations. Phones have a lot tools to help protect you in this. \n\nWorst case scenario - check Facebook, kijjii, etc, for free or cheap appliances or post your own ad seeking them. People upgrading rather give them away than deal with them sometimes. \n\nIn the end, you have contract law on your side, and the Lawyers and Realtors have ethical standards they have to meet to remain licensed. You have lots of Law and Regulatory boards, courts on your side.\n\nAnd congrats on your purchase. That is a foundation for your life going forward. You are blessed to own a home.\n\n* was Realtor In Canada/Alberta previous and Client Service Coordinator in Law Office.",

Your realtor should be able to set things straight. Worst case scenario (depending on your state) you can sue the seller in small claims. It varies from about $5,000-10,000 but can be as low as \\~$2,500.

It is nice that your Dad\u2019s legacy is giving you a strong foothold at an early age. \n\nIf you used a real estate attorney at closing you can likely have a quick (free) call with them about the situation and they can advise you on the best course of action (small claims, do you just buy replacements and then sue for difference in $1500 etc). Ultimately this will all be in the rear view soon. \n\nOh, and you can negotiate on appliances especially if you are buying several and especially if you buy ones on the floor. For example, if you found a fridge, washer and dryer totaling $2300 you may want to tell the lowes/hd manager the situation and ask if they could get close to $1500 if you opened a HD or lowes account (assuming your loan closed already).",

I wanted to do something he\u2019d be proud of. we just talked about if they don\u2019t pay the reimbursement for new appliances we\u2019ll have to go to small claims. disappointed but it is what it is, at least i get brand new appliances out of it. I will definitely try to negotiate though, i appreciate the advice",

    "postText": "So, my older half-brother has been named the heir of his uncle\u2019s estate. The problems are 1) my brother is severely mentally ill and though he is technically competent, it is unlikely he can make important legal decisions on his own and 2) my brother and the rest of his family live in NC while his uncle lived in CA. My family and I have no idea where to even begin. We don\u2019t even know if we can even do anything legally as we are not his legal guardians, nor do we have power of attorney over him. Does anyone have any advice?",

            "comment": "Competency of the heir is likely irrelevant.  \n\nSince you mention \"heir\" was there a will?  Was an executor named?  This executor would open the probate estate in the county the uncle was a resident of at the time of his demise.  If necessary, an attorney can be engaged to handle these matters for your family.",

    "postText": "I was in a single vehicle accident where I totaled my rental car, damaging some trees and fencing- no injuries to anyone. Walked away from the accident without any injuries just a concussion. Bc I had a concussion I was unaware I was in an accident I did not report it. Highway patrol ended up giving me a ride home as I was in town on work travel. That\u2019s the short version of the accident, really just looking for advice or guidance. They are stating the violation of hit and run misdemeanor. Now I have a CHP 215 notice to appear that says complaint to be filed with a date to appear in court. Should I hire a lawyer? Has anyone else been in this situation? What happens on the day I go to court?",

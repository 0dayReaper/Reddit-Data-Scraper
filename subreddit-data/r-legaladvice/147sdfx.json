Current court order saying father will not contact anyone on our side of the family to include his soon to be ex wife and will not talk badly about each other in presence of the kid. Lawyer we currently have is saying no one will believe their son of we get recording of him saying he was interrogated he is 5 years old. Help! Suggestions!?!?!",

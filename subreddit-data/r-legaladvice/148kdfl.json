    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating college next month and I really want to move out of my apartment because mold has continued to grow on the walls and windows and management has refused to do anything. My asthma is getting worse, so my husband has been cleaning up the mold our apartment since management has refused to do anything about it. I do have documentation and hospital records of having to go due to asthma attack. The only way to break my lease is to find someone else to buy it but who is going to want to buy a lease with a apartment containing mold. I live in Idaho btw.\nNot sure if this matters but my husband and I have always paid rent on time and a couple of months in advance.",

If you have say 6 months left in your lease, maybe tell your landlord that you\u2019re unhappy due to the issues, you\u2019ll move out by June 30th and will pay through July 31. See what they say. Maybe it\u2019s worth it to them to not go through however many months with an unhappy tenant.",

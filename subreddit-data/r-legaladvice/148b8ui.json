    "postText": "hello all. firstly, thank you for reading and any advice. im in a real bind here and need help. i live in the UK.\n\nso im 25m and im expecting my first born in a matter of days. i am no contact and have a warning letter against my mother that only applies to me and her. i met with my little sister yesterday 17f, shes 18 next week, and discussed how things are at home. my sister is being treated like a slave, she cant do her college work until the house is spotless and its 100% all on her and my little briother 18m. my brother and sister have been sharing a room for the past few months (not okay i know) because the 3rd bedroom has been my mums partners grow room (for green). they have trimmed the plants so there is still green on the property but they now have seperate rooms,. my sister is also having most of her wages taken for \"rent\" despite mum still getting child tax credits for her (Fraud?). i want my siblings out of there my mum is toxic af and abusive and her partner isnt any better. i offered to help my little sister get a place ( i dont really talk to younger brither since going NC with mum) or to house her with me for a bit but she declined.\n\nwhat can i do here without breaking the warning letter (i dont want her able to contact me again), withoyut causing potential issue for my child (mum will probably try to get custody of my child tbh) etc.\n\nthanks.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure that i understand the legal issue.  \n\nYour brother is an adult and your sister is one week away from turning 18.  They can simply move out of your mum's place.  It sounds as if your sister has declined your offer to stay with you.  You also don't seem to know what your brother wants.  You can't force your siblings to leave their mum or have separate rooms if they don't want to.",

    "postText": "I work at a restaurant and every other sunday we pressure wash the kitchen and back alley way. A lady has repeatedly complained and called the cops about the noise even though we\u2019re following within the rules of the noise ordinance. This past Sunday she came to the back alley way, where we have a locked gate. She stayed at the gate, and proceeded to record me and my coworker. She then later posted that video on Facebook. Do I have any means to legal action against her? Edit:We\u2019re closed on Sundays, I don\u2019t know if that changes anything.",

Then she shared the video of you out in public to the public.\n\nNo law was broken.\n\nYou can report the video to the hosting website and see if they'll take it down.  But you have no entitlement to see it taken down; that's at the hosting website's discretion.",

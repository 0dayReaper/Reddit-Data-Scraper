    "postText": "A college kid sold me a broken monitor for $100. I know it was my fault for trusting him but just seeing if there is any action I can take. I have his legal name, his car make and model, and evidence of his listing showing that the monitor was in \u201cgood condition\u201d. I reached out to him hoping if he just made a mistake and he deleted the listing. Is there anything I could do? I dont want to threaten him with police but it might scare him into getting my money back. Kind of silly and its just $100 and probably nothing i can really do but just throwing this out there.",

    "postText": "I am currently living in NYC and have been jumping around airbnbs. Noticed a rental room available while I was on a walk and called the landlady. I have seen the living space and found it to be in great shape and the other tenants are okay. She is offering a month to month rental for this room and wants me to Zelle her with the notes detailing it\u2019s for a security deposit and a first month for the room. She says if I include it in the notes for what it\u2019s for it\u2019ll be enough for me to keep my room. What do I need to do in order to be safe rather than sorry legally?",

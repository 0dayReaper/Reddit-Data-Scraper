    "postText": "Ok I\u2019ll try to keep this simple. My wife and I separated in 2021 and it unfortunately was an ugly divorce after 8 years of marriage. I hired a lawyer as did she. After many many months we finally had it finalized August 5th 2022. After this I fired my lawyer cause she was not what I needed and wasn\u2019t as smart as she led on, I hired a new lawyer a month later, so September 2022. As we unfortunately have another custody hearing with me being once again the respondent. My new lawyer found out that our divorce was actually never finalized by the judge, which both lawyers apparently just missed. Not sure how that happens. So we have still technically been married up until today. With that being said, am I entitled to any refund or compensation from my lawyer for her not doing her due diligence? I hired a divorce lawyer, paid tens of thousands, and she didn\u2019t do her job in making sure that happened but of course neither did my ex wife\u2019s lawyer. Thoughts? Am I missing something here that I could use to get money back?",

    "postText": "(Not sure if the correct flair, but it is the closest to banking)\n\nI was applying for a loan. Because I work the night shift, my husband typically communicates these things so I can sleep. I filled out the initial application with his phone number (so I don't get awoken by my phone ringing) and my email address.\n\nWhen a rep sent me a text message to my husband's phone, the number we provided them, I responded that I would like them to speak to my husband on the matter and said, \"He has permission to speak on the account.\" This was followed up, in email, not a text message, with them asking to speak with me verbally to get consent for my husband to speak on the application/account. They never got that. They called once when I could not speak, but we kept trying to get them to contact me to give them consent. Never happened.\n\nIn my email communications with them, I added my husband's email address as a CC; this way, he can see everything. NEVER providing my husband's email address as a part of the application process.\n\nYesterday, they denied our loan. I received a form letter via email to my email address, my husband got nothing as his email was not on the application. I emailed our rep asking that they take a second look.\n\nToday, my husband received a call from someone at the bank that left a voicemail, stating that I should check my email for important information regarding my application. Nothing in my email, but my husband received something from this person telling them they denied our application. My email address is not a CC, nor did it end up in my SPAM folder.\n\nNo communication has ever come to them from my husband's email address; he has only ever been CCed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is: does me saying via a text message, \"He has permission to speak on the account.\" give them permission to release information to my husband directly, and not me? Do they have consent to release any information to him at all, seeing as I never spoke with someone to give them verbal confirmation as they told me they needed? Do they not need to speak with me directly to confirm my identification in order to provide application/account information to a third party, even if the third party is my husband? Since his email address was never put on the application by either of us, are they allowed to email only him and not me?",

They have key fobs on all the doors and the garage is opened with a clicker for resident parking which you have to pay month for. There has been reports of numerous break ins, catalytic converters stolen, and whole vehicles stolen from the garage. However in light of this, they leave the garage doors open for days at a time, haven\u2019t installed any additional cameras, and haven\u2019t had security brought on to help curb the issues. Unfortunately I was one of the victims now, I filed a report with police and notified the complex of the theft. \n\nLiterally the day I reported the theft and had police come out the garage door was left open again all night, this afternoon I saw a car with multiple windows smashed. \n\nI took every precaution and even had a lock on the bike itself. I unfortunately didn\u2019t have comprehensive coverage on the bike (major lesson learned, everyone please check if you have this) so I\u2019m basically SOL. \n\nMy question is, do I have any legal recourse to go after the apartment? This building has continuously been targeted and is likely due to them not doing anything after multiple crimes of this nature. \n\nLuckily I\u2019m moving in 2 months but I\u2019d like to at least get out of my lease a month early. \n\nAny advice is helpful!",

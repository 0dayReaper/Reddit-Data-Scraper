    "postText": "I don\u2019t live with them but my immediate family reside in California. My dad, who is never really around has eufy surveillance cameras installed in the living room/entrance and my mom\u2019s bedroom, which is technically also in the living room (there are very large shelving units that divide the bedroom and living room). \n\nI live out of state but I am visiting my family and I am realizing how much of an invasion of privacy this is for my mom and three siblings. My family is telling me he is constantly watching them wherever he may be. My mom, for example, who is a stay-at-home parent can\u2019t go outside on her own without him calling and asking where she is going, why, and with who. She stays home most of the time because of his tendency to lash out verbally if she does something to anger him which is a whole other thing. They\u2019re also not allowed to have anyone over even if it\u2019s for a plumbing service which has been required for a while. \n\nAnyway, point is my family does not feel comfortable having these cameras constantly watching them since the spying is making them feel like prisoners, but they\u2019re afraid of taking them down because of how my dad may react. Can my dad legally keep these cameras up if the rest of my family does not consent to be recorded and/or he is using these cameras for malice?",

            "comment": "He can place cameras in places where those who are captured by them have no reasonable expectation of privacy, (one generally has an expectation of privacy in bedrooms and bathrooms, though if they have knowledge of surveillance equipment prior to entering those rooms, that expectation is diminished). There might be a legal issue here under certain circumstances  if  the cameras transmit/record audio. Your family is legally free to, in the least, cover them any time they want. It\u2019s likely there\u2019d be no legal consequence to removing them entirely, not for your mother/underaged siblings. They should take care not to damage the cameras if they  remove them.",

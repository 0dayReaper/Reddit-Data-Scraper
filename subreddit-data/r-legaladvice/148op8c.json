And you risk getting in trouble at school for this, big time, for bullying at a minimum. If people \"actually like the account\" that doesn't change anything legally or administratively. You can do this in the privacy of your own home, but you cannot distribute them or share them.",

Whoever takes a picture owns the copyright, unless it's assigned to someone else at the time (work made for hire).\n\n&gt; the edited version would be my copyright, no?\n\nYes, but not wholly yours. Nobody else could use it, but you can't use it either. You can't exploit it. There are exceptions for parody and transformation, but those things are ultimately established in court.\n\nImagine that you take Star Wars and you make everyone in it a zombie. You'd own the copyright to your changes, but the underlying copyright still belongs to Disney. Nobody else could use it without Disney's permission, *and* yours.\n\nBut this is all hypothetical, because this is a great way to get suspended.",

Even if they were taken by students in a journalism class, the school may have it written that they still own the rights to those photos. Basically if they\u2019re publishing the images than they have rights to them. I can\u2019t imagine them selling you the rights to the photos, so there\u2019s really no legal way to do this. Also, I would strongly recommend not doing it, because if even one teacher gets upset about it the school may punish you very harshly.",

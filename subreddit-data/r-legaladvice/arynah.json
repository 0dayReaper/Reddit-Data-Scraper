    "postText": "I get my daughter every other weekend. She\u2019s 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. \n\nThis weekend, we were watching a movie when I got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t attach myself to my phone (unless I\u2019m working) and I got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. \n\nWhen I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. \n\nThe movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I\u2019d be up to tuck her in. \n\nI went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. \n\nHe mother was SCREAMING into the phone \u201cYOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!\u201d\n\nI took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. \n\nShe yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn\u2019t true at all. \n\nI asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  \n\nI handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear \u201cdaddy is going to leave the room now, please don\u2019t stay on the phone long, it\u2019s way past your bedtime.\u201d (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). \n\nI had to get my stepson to bed (he\u2019s a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). \n\nI walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she\u2019s repeating \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. \n\nI walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. \n\nI sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn\u2019t speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. \n\nI\u2019m sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. Divorce is hard enough on children, and I think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be. \n\nWhat can I do?",

Most States have very strict laws against parental alienation. \n\nmake sure you document the discussions that you have with your ex. Do not drag your kids back to court. \n\nConsult with your attorney, and prepare yourself. Ensure you never bad mouth your ex to the daughter. Check over your documents from the divorce and look for the word disparaging. The explicit text to tell you to fuck off, is in fact disparaging statements to the children which would mean in a court, you could push for more JOINT custody, 50/50 split, or even try to get a temporary order for a custody adjustment. She is most likely in violation of disparaging statements outlined in the custody agreement and family plan. \n\nEnsure that your issues are taken seriously, by filing soon with your attorney. Please, please, for your daughters sake. Take note of EVERYTHING, and get your attorney on the line ASAP. This is unacceptable behavior and the judge will see that as well. ",

Because you definitely should. It\u2019s another step she has to go through to communicate with you and it may help her chill the fuck out since she knows you can show it to your attorney any day. It\u2019s the same with phones, but it adds a layer of formality that may serve to deter some of the bullshit.\n\nAs others have noted, you need to keep a record of all of her bad behavior and hopefully you have been. But telling your 9yo daughter to tell you \u201cfuck you\u201d is above and beyond anything that could be excused by frustration between exes. A judge should hear about that. Talk to your lawyer.",

I would also ask if she\u2019s happy living with her mom. If she says no, ask if she wants to live with you, if yes, take the mother to court.

Common sense tells us that will increase her verbal abuse.\n\nSecond, giving the daughter a 'secret' phone doesn't solve the problem of the mother talking to/abusing the daughter. There's still the original phone.\n\nThird, having a phone that dad instructs the daughter to keep secret makes him look bad. I imagine opposing counsel would have a field day with that information.\n\n&gt; If she wants to talk to the daughter, she has to go through Dad.\n\nThat's probably not a horrible idea. Dad should definitely keep tabs on the daughter's emotional well-being during calls with mom.",

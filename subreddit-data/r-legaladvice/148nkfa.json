    "postText": "A couple months back I bought a used bicycle from a local shop. This is a legit local store and I got a bill of sale for let's call it bike A for $2,000 cash.\n\nI received a email from the purported \"owner\" of the bike store. It's a bit long winded but he claims that\n\n1. He was out of country for 6 months and left an employee in charge of the store\n2. The employee ran the store, buying and selling bikes but he stole from the owner and took off with tens of thousands of dollars and deleted records\n3. The owner found that I scheduled an appointment to look at a bike B and that bike B is worth $15,000 and is gone. \n4. Owner is asking me to either return bike B or pay fair market value for it but he'll give me a 20% discount if I'd like to keep it.\n5. If I don't return the bike or pay for it he'll report me to the police.\n\nProblem is, I didn't buy bike B, I bought bike A which is worth a lot less. I like bike A and want to keep it but I've already paid for it. And ofc I don't have bike B nor do I want to pay 15K for it.\n\nI live in a smallish town and the cycling community is small. People know I bought my bike A from the bike shop and its only a matter of time until shop owner shows up to a group ride. I'm a bit worried about my reputation if the owner tells everyone I'm riding a stolen bike, I don't want confrontation/problems.\n\nDoes the owner have a leg to stand on here? My thinking is that this is a problem between him and his employee, legally speaking. But see my concerns about reputation above.\n\nAny advice?",

            "comment": "\"Dear owner.  I'm sorry to hear about how your employee stole from you.   I did buy a bike from your store, but it's not the bike you described.  I have a receipt for that sale.   \\[Or credit card record or whatever.\\]   Hope you catch the guy.\"\n\nIt sounds like the employee was selling bikes and embezzling the money.  That's the owner's problem, not yours.  He left the employee in charge.   The bikes aren't stolen -- what's stolen is the money people paid for the bikes.",

I would document by taking pictures of your bike, getting the receipt/credit card statement and letting the owner know that while you are sorry he is going through issues you didn't buy the bike he claims, you have a receipt and you don't appreciate being threatened. If he had anything, he would have gone right to the police and they likely would have already interviewed you. He wants to scare you into paying for something you don't owe. It may even be worth it to do a consultation with a lawyer and see if they can send a letter telling the owner to back off.",

You may also want a lawyer to explore options to protect you and your property as well as any communication with the shop.",

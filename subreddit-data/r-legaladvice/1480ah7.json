    "postText": "   So we were just chilling in the bathroom and one dude challenged us to jump higher than the bathroom counter. \n\nWe all tried without actually puting our legs anywhere near it except one which jumped slightly forward and off balance tried to keep himself from tripping by putting his leg on the counter. \n\nThe whole granite slab side of the counter fell off and the sink bowl aswell, breaking the granite while the bowl is fine. \n\nAll 5 of us were in the bathroom at the time and the school council seems like it's accusing us all of being accomplices for one persons doing and they want us all to share the price for it instead of just the one who messed up, is there anything we can do to convince them not to? \n\nThe student who broke it even confessed and didn't mind paying.",

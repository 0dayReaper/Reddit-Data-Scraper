I lost my social and my birth certificate in a house fire and just recently lost my ID. How do I go about getting all of these and what order? I\u2019ve been trying to get them for months with no luck.",

Typically, there is a small fee. In some cases, the state agency uses a third-party vendor but begin your search at the official state agency to make sure you are using a legitimate provider. You can start that process at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm\n\nYou can start the process of replacing your Social Security card at https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/\n\nIf you have ever had a job or filed taxes, you can contact those employers to get a duplicate W-2 form.\n\nYou can get a copy of your school transcipts whenever you have enough ID collected to do so. ID might not be required for an adult. Each school district has an office that provides this service, but it might take a phone call or two to locate them.\n\nThe next step would be probably be to get a state ID or state driver license. You'll either want to replace your Michigan license or, if you're staying in Indiana for more than a short while, get a new Indiana license. [Here's the site for Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/license-id/license-and-id) and [here's the site for Indiana](https://www.in.gov/bmv/licenses-permits-ids/new-indiana-residents/). Go over the list of requirements for a state ID that is on that Web site. It's a long list, but there are probably a great many alternative documents. Look for the quickest, easiest choice for each of the required documents and just work through them. Sometimes there is no shortcut, so you've just got to be persistent and diligent.\n\nYou should try to receive some kind of mail at your new address. A phone bill and a bank statement are good choices, but get even more if possible. Keep the paper bills because they come in handy.\n\nPut in a change of address form with USPS and/or put in a forwarding notice so all of your mail will get sent to your new address.\n\nIf you are moving to Indiana permanently, you should register to vote as soon as you have a permanent or semi-permanent address.\n\nYou should obtain a public library card as soon as you have the requirements necessary.\n\nAll of these things should get you back in action for most purposes.",

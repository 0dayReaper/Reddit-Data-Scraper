    "postText": "I've never posted on Reddit before, so please let me know if I should put this post in a different community. I hope someone here could help me with my situation or at least point me in the right direction. I was 17 when I first started undergrad at a local community college, and thanks to my academics I got pretty much a free undergrad degree (excluding some fees, textbooks, and meal plans). My father, who said he'd pay for my undergrad, barely had to pay what he was expecting to. Now that I have finished my undergrad, I have a GA position lined up that will pay half of my tuition for when I am go back for graduate school at that same community college in the fall. I figured at 20 it was high time I started doing other adult stuff like getting a credit card, however to my surprise I was denied for \"outstanding unpaid loans\" despite never having taken any out. It was then that I found out my father had taken out student loans in my name, and had been using the money to do whatever he wanted without my knowledge or consent. My dad makes good money and my family unit is around middle/upper-middle class, and in addition to my scholarships there should have been no reason for him to take out those loans. I feel that I should add that although my family is financially well off, my dad rarely allows money to be spent on anyone else in the family. Before I started working my current job two years ago, my mom got a job just to be able to take my sister and I to go thrifting every once in a while to have time and special things for ourselves without having to ask and be guilt tripped about money for small things. In addition, he is backtracking on his claim that he'll give me money that he promised me (10k, which was incredible because I never expected him to promise me that amount of money!) to put into my savings as a graduation gift. When he first changed his mind, he said he'd only give me half of that amount and the rest he would put towards the remaining fees that my GA position didn't cover-- which was fine. I was upset at first because he has gone back on his word on other things before, but I was still happy that I was getting something at all. Today I found out that he is playing with the idea of not giving me any of the money he originally promised me, and instead putting it towards my grad school. Perhaps I am being selfish or stupid, but he hardly had to pay anything for my undergrad, and if he hadn't taken out those loans he could have used the money to pay for my graduate school instead of playing around with it. I can't even apply for a credit card to build up my credit, and even though he says he is paying the loans back I'm terrified of leaving my credit score in his fickle hands. I don't even know where to start building a case against him, and I don't know if I should even think about suing him because if things go south I would lose everything. I'm both scared to rock the boat and scared for my future if I don't. If there is a better place for me to put this, or any advice, please let me know. I'm happy to answer questions, I wrote this right after I got really emotional so I may have missed some stuff or made it a bit confusing. Thank you again to anyone who read this far, I appreciate your time.",

Either you take on the loans (and all of this will repeat itself, 100% guaranteed), *or* you fight it and that almost certainly involves at the very least filing a police report at some point.",

I'd feel guilty for cutting off the financial support for my mother and sibling, in addition to myself. Our insurance for our medications and medical care all go through his job, and I don't know how we could feasibly support ourselves for the foreseeable future without him being employed. The way we live our life (although it's not great in some parts) would potentially become non-existent. He is still technically paying for the rest of my grad school, and all of that will go away if I take legal action.

You owe your father nothing and he has stolen from you big time. Please don\u2019t allow him to steal your future. \n\nBut even if you decide to do nothing, you still need to freeze your and your sister\u2019s credit and put a fraud alert on them. When he can\u2019t get any more from you, he will go after her. I\u2019m sure your mom\u2019s credit is already ruined.",

In my case, who has the power of attorney if I were to be hospitalized?\n\nBackground: I missed a summer due to my disability.",

And in Texas at least, having a fiancee, by itself, does not change your POA.\n\nIf you no longer want your father to be your agent under your medical POA, you should sign a new one.  (Same goes for your financial POA, too, if you have one.)",

I didn't want to assume anything when it comes to that; it's not that I distrust my fiancee but everything that she knows of my long stint in the hospital is pretty much second hand whereas my dad was there the whole time. \n\nRelating to a financial POA:\n     I have life insurance from my former employer which goes to my father first, does that make him a financial POA after my death?",

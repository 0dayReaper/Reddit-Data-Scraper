            "comment": "&gt;Next day I talk to HR about getting combination done for my illness .\n\nPresumably you're talking here about an accommodation under the ADA?\n\n&gt;Co worker came over with my mom to basically check my work which should not happen.\n\nThat could be a company policy issue, it isn't a legal one.  Lots of us have our work looked over by peers, especially when we're new.  \n\n&gt;Her Co worker kept going on how I need to quite my job again .\n\nThat isn't appropriate and you should discuss that with HR so she stops.  It can be hers to decide whether your work is up to snuff if the company makes it so.  But she should stop short of suggesting you leave, especially if an accommodation is in the works.  \n\nIt sounds like you quit, rendering the rest of this moot.  Though I guess at this point you might go back to HR, talk about what happened, and ask for your job back.  \n\nIf you do, it isn't clear how your accommodation plays out here.  Being able to skip trash cans (or more generally do less or lower quality work) probably isn't a reasonable accommodation.  \n\nGet with your physician.  Understand what specific accommodations you might ask for.  Ask for them in the formal process.  In the meanwhile, discuss with HR whether this person is supposed to be checking your work and what should play out while you work through your accommodations.",

    "postText": "I'm going to try and make everything straight to the point.  Here I go:  \n\n\nObjective:  To know whether if I have a case to even try and go to small claims court or just cut my losses\n\nLocation:  Lawton, OK  \nParty Involved:  Myself and a local business  \nJob:  Installing septic sprinkler heads\n\nTimeline\n\n* Business sent us a quote for job and we accepted\n* Business came and installed sprinkler heads as agreed upon\n* Something didn't feel right so I looked up local codes.  Septic sprinklers are not allowed within 10 feet of fence line which they did install\n* I called and asked them to fix it.  They pushed back saying this is what we agreed to.  I pointed out that was against state code.  They said they would fix it.\n* No word from business, then worker shows up unannounced to fix it\n* Work is completed\n* Weeks goes by with no contact from Business.  We think it is all done and write all this off as a sucky deal.\n* Worker shows up unannounced to fix the previous job.  City inspector was coming to inspect their work.\n   * They had to replace all the piping as it was not with in reg for septic lines.  Septic lines are thicker and colored purple to warn people\n   * Lines had to be dug deeper than the first time they did it\n   * They were required to pull a permit (the fact the guy said he never had to do in 19 years was concerning)\n   * Cap all the sprinkler heads with purple tops as per city code\n* Passed inspection and completed work (I did not contact the city inspector)\n   * Left trash in my yard (pictures taken)\n   * Sprinkler heads are under ground causing algae (pictures taken)\n   * Part of where they dug is collapsing in (pictures taken)\n   * They didn't reseed the yard where they dug so now there are bare spots\n* Called owner and requested for a refund for all the labor.   Nothing more\n   * It took three days to contact him.  No call backs but me calling him.\n   * I stated it was not okay how they left my yard\n   * This is the second time they showed up unannounced to fix things\n   * The first two times they conducted work was not according to code for septic lines\n   * Owner has yet to come to my house to observe the state of my yard\n* Owner said he would need to discuss with other owners\n* Total time of trying to work this out has been 2 weeks with me always calling (call logs available)\n   * Reached him today and he stated that I would get something but not a full refund on labor\n\nWhat I want to do:\n\n* Go to small claims court to resolve this\n* Escalate to full refund, cost of lawyer and court fees, and charge for someone to fix my stuff.  Not looking for anything extra but just what is fair.\n* My justification for this is it clear the business owner is avoiding to resolve the issue and take accountability, wasn't qualified to work on my property in the first place, and is trying to hide the code violations his company did at my property\n\nWhat I need to know:\n\n* Is this worth the effort to go to small claims.  Looking probably $4000 to $5000 in all for what I'm thinking.\n* Or will this come as a petty owner?  I feel like I'm justified but court is a game you need to play.\n* Based on what I get back here, I will then move to trying to find someone local to provide legal advice.  But since this is a small town, there isn't many options.",

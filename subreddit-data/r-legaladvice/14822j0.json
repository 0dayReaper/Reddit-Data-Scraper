    "postText": "In 2013 I was convicted of a felony as a very young adult. I successfully completed my sentence and my felony was expunged. Fast forward to now, I find out that I am still a felon and the expungment was only for the court record. \n\nI was told that it would be for the criminal and court record. I dont even know where to begin to fix this problem. Any advice would be greatly welcomed.\n\nThanks!",

But unfortunately you were mistaken in your belief that expungement removes the felony and restores gun rights, which isn't a criticism of you because most lawyers don't get that either.\n\nYou can, however, get the fingerprints and arrest records removed with the Department of Justice in most cases by filing the necessary form.

Only cases where no charges resulted in a conviction can be removed from it. However, I could be wrong. You may benefit from a governor\u2019s pardon, but those are not easy to get.",

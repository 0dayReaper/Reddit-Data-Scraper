    "postText": "Hey everybody,\nSo it\u2019s a complex situation, basically friend told me I legally raped him and I want to figure out if what he is saying is true.\n\nBackground: we had an intimate relationship before that night where we would engage in everything but sex. We did not go all the way because he did not want to.\n\nNight: we were both under influence he more so than I (he is saying he wasn\u2019t able to give consent though he was still able to talk coherently, he just had a panic attack before that). I cuddled up very close next to him with clothes on to calm him down (he says that was sexual harassment/ me initiating). He undressed me and did it in the next breath even though I told him to stop. \n\nHis argument is that I had the power to actually stop him if I wanted to since I was way less under influence, that he would have never done it if he wasn\u2019t under influence and me being so close. He is saying that I had the intent so that legally I would be at fault.\n\nWould this under any circumstances be considered rape on my part? If yes or no could you send links? \nI think his argument is unsound since my verbal confirmation that I did not want it should count more than his \u201cinability\u201d to give consent.",

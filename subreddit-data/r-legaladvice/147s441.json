    "postText": "Hey all. Looking for some advice on what to do.\n\nI live in a townhouse with teens. We have no yard and instead take our dogs on walks. Recently however we\u2019ve come into a problem regarding a neighbor down the block. \n\nShe owns a huge dog, looks like a Staffordshire. But she\u2019s elderly, small, and not very strong but owns a huge, powerful, reactive dog. It drags her around like a toy. On at least two occasions it has torn away from her and attacked our dogs. I\u2019ve almost hit both her and the dog with my car because it saw a squirrel and bolted across the street right in front of my car.\n\nMy boy (16) came back from walking his dog last week in tears. I ask what\u2019s wrong, what happened? He says a huge dog raced across the street to go after his puppy and he couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it. It was a good 40+ pounds heavier than her and it had tangled its leash around his ankle and tripped him and he couldn\u2019t get up to protect his dog and it took a separate neighbor in his garage hearing the commotion and racing over to help to control the dog and help Luka home. It was definitely not playing, he says sounded like bloody murder. \n\nBoth Luka and his puppy are fine, but I\u2019m at a loss at what to do. These incidents have been happening for a month or two and today he saw that dog outside and raced home shaking. He\u2019s so gentle with animals, it breaks my heart to see him afraid of one. There\u2019s no bite marks on either of them so I can\u2019t press charges for injury by negligence. His owner always apologizes but she still tries walking him on her own. What do I do?",

Animal control might not act until someone is bitten. This depends on your location ofc.",

It is probably going to take several instances before anything can truly be done. The animal will not be seized immediately. Don't get discouraged, keep calling, show a pattern, and make this animal control's problem.\n\nIn Illinois, an owner is required to be in control of their dog at all times. This neighbor is not in control of her pet.",

Tasers can be expensive and unreliable IMO though, so that's why I say pepper spray.",

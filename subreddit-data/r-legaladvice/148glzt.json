    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if this is the right sub to post this on, but my girlfriend never received her W-2 from her old job. We\u2019re both 18 so neither of us really know a whole lot about how taxes work, I just filed mine through turbo tax back in April. She worked at two different locations at a Texas Local fast food chain called P-Terrys for part of the year, and then started a new job at HEB, a Texas grocery store. She has her HEB W-2, but for months has been contacting P-Terrys to get it and has been unable to. There\u2019s only three emails P-Terrys has provided on their site to contact them, and she has emailed all of them several times and gotten no response. She\u2019s asked her previous managers what to do and they just tell her to contact the emails on the site. Does anybody know if there\u2019s an alternative way to find your W-2, or if there\u2019s something else she should do? Thank you.",

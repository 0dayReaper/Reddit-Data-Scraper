    "postText": "I work as a professor at a university. Given my area of research, I have been asked to be an expert witness in a trial. Even if I was to do it pro bono, I would still need to be reimbursed for travel. I'm worried that this might break the conditions of my H1B Visa, since it's payment not from my employer.\n\nI asked my immigration lawyer for their perspective and they said this likely would not be allowed but to ask my university in order to be sure since they are the ones who sponsored the visa.\n\nSo, I asked the international department at my university for advice and they said that not only reimbursement but also even payment would be acceptable so long as this work is occasional and on a short-term basis. There seems to be some conflicting opinions, therefore.\n\nI just wanted to check with the community here before I accept if the university's opinion seems consistent with your understanding. Also, theoretically, if it was to be an issue, who would actually get in touch with me, how would it happen, and what would the consequences be? Any further insight would be appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: In case anyone else has this issue, I got another immigration lawyer opinion: Basically, my employer has to be able to argue it is incidental to my employment. If not, I can't do it.  \n",

            "comment": " Traveling professor here (former). In my experience, the money usually is paid in a form of a stipend. The inviting college arranges for flight and hotel (or works with your college to arrange payment for these. Payment going to the college and not you). Then you will get a stipend to cover food and transportation. I\u2019m really surprised your college isn\u2019t being more helpful.\n\nEdit: Ask them to handle this situation like they would if you were invited to lecture at a different college.",

Just to be clear, I'm being asked by a court to give expert witness testimony during their trial, so it's a bit different than giving a guest lecture. There is clear guidance from the university on guest lecturing at different institutions, fortunately, but expert testimony seems to be more unusual (though not in my research field).",

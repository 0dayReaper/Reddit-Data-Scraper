    "postText": "Hello! \nI work for a very large company. I was hired as a remote teleworker for this position 2 years ago. When I was hired it was strictly a remote position (not just for Covid) and I was told there would be no change to that. \nRecently we\u2019ve been told that we must go back to the office permanently. I live about 30 minutes away from a satellite office. However I was told that we MUST work in the same office as our team, therefore the office near me is not an option.\nThey have told us they will give us a \u201cdesignation\u201d of which approved office we must report to. The list of approved offices are all in different states than I currently live in. Once I have my designation I can either relocate (ON MY OWN DIME, NO RELOCATION ASSISTANCE) or I can decline and be put on a list to be surplussed.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight to share on the legal aspects of this? I have briefly looked into employee relocation rights but I\u2019m feeling extremely overwhelmed. Are there any loopholes that can help me keep my job? \n\nThank you in advance for any insight!",

It's the absence of a employment contract that says you're permanently remote without any other language saying that can be changed. In all 50 states there's really no protection for this, none us has an absolute right to work from home &amp; our employers can change our work location.",

Your schedule/hours, assignments and work locations are not guaranteed.  \n\nYou are not alone.  Return to the office is definitely a trend that is happening now.  Even some companies that were solidly WFH before Covid are now requiring their employees to come back to the office, at least as a hybrid schedule.  \n\nIn absence of an employment contract (not just an offer letter), there are no legal loopholes.",

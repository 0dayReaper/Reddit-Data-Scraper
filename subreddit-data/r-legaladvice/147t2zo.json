The job description states, \"qualified applicants with chronic medical conditions and/or disabilities receive job preference.\" Can my employer force me to undergo testing or provide documentation to prove that I have a chronic condition. What is involved other than making the claim?",

An employer can't \"force\" anything.  They can in many cases make medical testing or examination a condition of employment or ongoing employment.  That would be surprising and perhaps problematic in this case (though that could perhaps change with some additional context)",

    "postText": "Hello, I have a question regarding liability for fire damage in the UK (LegalAdviceUK is currently private). We had a fire in the flat/apartment we are renting which we accept was our responsibility however we didn't have any smoke alarms. There was a fault with the alarm while we were away so it was taken away by the agency who let themselves in while we were gone. They said they would send a replacement but never did.\n\nThe fire started in the middle of the night last night. We were woken up by the CO2 alarm in the kitchen (Where the fire was). By the time we were awake and realised what was happening the kitchen and hall was already full of smoke. I think that if there was a proper alarm it would be more sensitive to the smoke and would've alerted us much sooner and thus reducing the fire damage. It was a small fire which i put a bucket of water over before we evacuated the building (however fire brigade were still called) but it would've been even less if we caught it earlier from a smoke detector.\n\nAre we liable to pay for repairs as we did accidentally cause the fire or does the managing agent need to accept some responsibility for failing to meet legal safety requirements which have in-turn put our lives at risk and  failed to alert us sooner of the fire.",

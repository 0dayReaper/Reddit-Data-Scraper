    "postText": "Greetings to anyone reading this. To make a simple point, my father's vehicle was damaged in a storm. Paid through insurance, the repairs were done at a dealership. The vehicle was completely repainted (dents filled I believe), and most of the glass was replaced. The repairs started in October or November of 2018 (I will need to go back to paperwork for specific dates), but for various reasons the work was not done until sometime in late spring 2019 (again I don't have the specific date on hand).\n\nThere was a whole bunch of drama with the dealership not wanting to do the work properly and the insurance company wanting to total the vehicle. It was a crazy situation that ended with him keeping the vehicle (totaling and reinstating after inspection). Well, there have been various issues arisen with the paint job, and as of yesterday (June 11th, 2013), the windshield seal began leaking at the top. \n\nMy father just recently found out the dealership could still be held responsible for the workmanship (even though it was through an insurance claim and the vehicle was totaled). We tried looking into the laws about this, but I am having a hard time determining the laws pertaining to such a situation. I am also not sure about the statute of limitations. What Georgia laws will I need for determining if he should file suit? Also, what are the statute of limitations? \n\nThank you in advance.",

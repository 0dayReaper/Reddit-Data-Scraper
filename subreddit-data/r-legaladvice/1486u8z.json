    "postText": "We have been told time and time and time again by our apartment\u2019s manager to call the apartment\u2019s security officer every single time we 1) have weed coming into our apartment through the vents and 2) the noise at the pool gets to the point that we can\u2019t sleep after the pool has been closed. There isn\u2019t a number to them directly, you have to call the leasing office and then it transfers you to someone who speaks with them. We not only had no way of knowing it\u2019s just one guy, but it\u2019s a game of telephone on the information they get anyways. \n\nI have been emailing the office for MONTHS about these unresolved issues and we are always met with the same thing: call the security officer and they will take care of it. \n\nTonight we did that. We are fed up. Our \u201cluxury\u201d apartment is run like a frat house, we\u2019re tired, we need quiet during QUIET. HOURS. So we call like we\u2019ve been told to.\n\nThe security officer screamed at my husband, SCREAMED at him. I got it on audio recording. His rant went from the world doesn\u2019t revolve around us to it wasn\u2019t even a large party at the pool to he *promises* (a threat?) to come bang on our door every single time we call and to stop \u201cchecking on him\u201d (????? We don\u2019t even know what that means). \n\nSo can we break our lease now that the SECURITY OFFICER WHOSE JOB IT IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND ENFORCE RULES came to our door at 11:30 PM, knocked like he was gonna break down our door, and screamed at us!?!?!? He even went on a rant about how his wife has to wake his children up for school and told us to fuck off? \n\nOn top of it all he is a resident here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for a resident to come to another resident\u2019s door and scream at them at 11:30 at night!?!? \n\nWHAT. THE. HECK. IS. GOING. ON.",

    "postText": "My father has a case of elephantiasis and has been hospitalised due to a recent infection to his foot, likely to be amputated. In the past he was moved many times to different departments, where he was comfortable and could see my mom at least once a day. \n\nToday he has been moved once again and he is desperate. The bed is problematic (he is obese and might damage him), he feels trapped but what harms him the most is that he can't see us, only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. He says he can't make it without us. It's damaging him mentally and psychologically, and us too. \n\nHe wants to be moved again, but they don't seem to listen or maybe it isn't possible. Is there a way to change something? To make him feel better or even get a change of departments? Please, I need an answer. We are very worried. Please. \n\nThank you.",

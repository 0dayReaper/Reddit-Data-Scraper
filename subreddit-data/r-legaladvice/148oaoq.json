    "postText": "14th Amendment \n\u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d\n\nSo NADDI made a list of everyone convicted of a vague \u201cdrug related\u201d felony. Persons on the list cannot buy any pseudoephedrine products while persons not on the list can purchase the products. Nobody was ever sentenced to being on this list. This list was never included in anyone\u2019s plea agreement. There is no expiration or a time frame after which persons will be removed from the list. \n\nHow is that not deprivation of liberty without due process? How is that equal protection?\n\nThey decided one day to add an extra sentence to anyone convicted of a \u201cdrug related\u201d felony. Most of those people completed their sentences long ago. How does that not run afoul of the 14th Amendment?\n\nI think the sex offender registry is also unconstitutional but at least most people currently on it were sentenced to it. Its the inch that was given for the mile they are currently taking. Ill be looking out for more government naughty list used the abridge freedom without due process. They seem to be on a roll.",

This is no different than felons being denied the right to own firearms, a right that is explicitly in the Constitution unlike the right to purchase pseudoephedrine.",

    "postText": "For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and \"a good spankin'\" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me \"repossessed\" by \"the goons.\" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been \"gooned\" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?",

Let the counselors know that your mother has threatened to have you abducted. You should be telling absolutely anyone that will listen. There is no telling if your mom will try and hire someone or fool them into helping her so tell everyone so they cant get fooled into helping her. \n\nYou should file a police report at every incident. If you have any threats in text, you may be able to get an order of protection, restraining order, or ex parte order. You need to speak with a lawyer/police and see what you can get help with.  \n\nIf anything happens and any medical professionals grab you then be super calm. As much as you are able, offer no resistance and speak calmly. Explain you mom is trying to force you to return to her house, dont say 'home'. \n\nIf someone grabs you and takes you across state lines, then try and let people know. Breathe on the window and write 'help'. Try and keep lipstick or something you can write with to leave a note. If they get you across state lines,  try and call 911. Kidnapping across state lines is some pretty hefty federal charges. Just because you are a minor in Nebraska, this will have zero bearing on an adult getting kidnapped in Colorado. ",

Since it's all you've known, you may think it is, but it most definitely is not. Here is what I would do in your shoes:\n\n1. Send a written notice to your mother, certified, receipt requested mail (spend a $100 and have an attorney do it if you really want to get your point across), and let her know, very clearly, that you do not want her to contact you again. \n\n2. Let your dorm RA manager know about her and let her know that she is not welcome and to call police if she comes. \n\n3. Let the campus security know she is not welcome. \n\n4. Do a hard reset/wipe of your phone, get a new phone number and do not give it to her. \n\n5. Do not go to NE until you are 19. \n\n6. Keep a file with all of her threats in it so if she tries to convince someone that you are a threat to yourself to have your committed to a psychiatric hospital you can have something to show them. If you do talk to her (which I don't recommend), record all of the calls. \n\n7. Let any other family members or friends back home know not to give your information to her.\n\n8. Enjoy your freedom. \n\nAlso, if she continues to harass you after your have sent the letter specifically telling her not to, you can look into filing a restraining order.",

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

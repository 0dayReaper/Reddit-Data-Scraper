    "postText": "I stumbled across a negative post about my last job on Reddit. I haven\u2019t worked there for over a year. I narrowed down who that person was (ex coworker), as they left quite a few obvious points in there, down to one of three possible people. Everything in the post was very true so I commented adding in more (truthful but negative) information. The original post was deleted and I deleted my comment, but apparently not soon enough. \n\nA different previous coworker texted me later asking if I had wrote the post. I said I didn\u2019t write the post but had an idea who it was. I didn\u2019t confirm who it was.\n\nCan I get in any sort of trouble from this? Everything I wrote was truthful and I could confirm with other coworkers, it would be on old camera footage (if they still have it/let me see it), plus there are other reviews mentioning the same things. I have a new job where I\u2019ve been for over a year, I wouldn\u2019t have used them as a reference in any way because my leaving caused friction. I blocked who I could on Facebook and secured my privacy settings as the boss is quite petty.",

            "comment": "if the statements you made were true and you can provide evidence to support them, it may be more challenging for someone to successfully claim defamation against you. truth is generally a defense to a defamation claim, as the law typically recognizes a right to express truthful information, even if it is negative or critical. it's worth mentioning that defamation laws can be complex, and the specific circumstances of your situation may influence the outcome.\n\nto simplify, you should delete all negative comments or posts about your previous work, set your social media to private, and avoid discussing about this publicly.\n\nif someone contacts you about this situation, you can choose to confirm or not confirm your involvement",

It was all truthful and while it might be a bit tricky to relay the evidence of it being true I could do it. \n\nIs there a difference between this and a standard negative review?",

In my reply I mentioned the rodent infestation and how I had to clean under the booths and how I came across a very disturbing thing while doing so (I won\u2019t mention it here!). I told all our other staff about what I found, there are multiple negative reviews regarding finding rodents, exterminators were hired, and all the staff knew about the issue. I once had a table keep their feet up the entire time they were there.",

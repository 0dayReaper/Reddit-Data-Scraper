    "postText": "Context: this takes place in Florida, USA. My roommate and I rented a 2 bedroom apartment and the lease was set for 12 months. \n\nThe apartment complex was repeatedly in clear violation of the lease. After 6 months and having numerous, numerous talks with the property manager (complex is owned by a large corporation) we invoked our right to end the lease early. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and sent them record of the lease violations. \n\nI have never studied law. But I did extensive googling before making this decision and Florida tenant law says that if the landlord is in violation of the lease or federal/state laws (they were in violation of both) and they don\u2019t fix it within 10 days after written notice (we gave them months and multiple notices) then it is the tenant\u2019s right to break the lease. So that\u2019s what we did. \n\nNow they are trying to stick us with a massive bill (over $5000). I sent back a formal refute that was 18 pages of evidence of lease violations on their part and no wrongdoing on our part. We also sent them a negotiation offer saying that they can keep the security deposit if they drop the charges. \n\nWhat are our odds this works? Or do we need a lawyer to have any chance at winning this?",

    "postText": "Background:\n\nMy husband and I bought a house in 2016 from a bank, as it had foreclosed upon the previous owner. About a year after we moved in, the previous owner showed up at our front door and tried to push past my sister to get into the house, saying she owned it. She left after threatening to call the police, but showed up 4-5 more times over the next 1.5 years, doing the same thing. She brought the police herself once, and they told her to leave once we showed him our contracts from closing on the house. He said that if she came back it would be considered trespassing, and included in his paperwork that she wasn't welcome on the property-- fortunately she hasn't been back since then. We invested in a Ring doorbell and security cameras near each door after the first two visits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that she brought us to housing court in 2018 to try to evict us (from the house we own) but did not show up because she put our address down as her own in the paperwork, therefore never received the notice to appear since her copy was mailed to us. Fortunately we have title insurance and they send a lawyer to represent us for free, and the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. About a year later, she did the exact same thing but showed up to court saying she has a certified deed to the house so she owns it. The same lawyer represented this time, and the judge dismissed it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mail part:\n\nA bit over a year ago we began receiving her monthly phone bill in the mail (she didn't just forget to change the address after she moved, there was a 2-3 year gap with no mail in her name) so my husband brought a few of them, unopened, to the post office, explained what had been going on, and they said they'd take care of it. Then in summer 2019, the key to our mailbox no longer worked-- it turned out she brought her deed to the post office, said she lost her key, and asked them to change the lock and give her a new key. Fortunately when my husband realized the key didn't work, he went to the post office and was able to intercept before they gave her the new key, so I don't believe she actually gained access to the mailbox.\n\nDuring this time, the cell phone bills never stopped, and we've been receiving more mail in her name (from a radiology office, the Motor Vehicles Association, and other random non-spam items). I worry she's trying to do the same thing again-- have mail sent to our address, steal it somehow, and attempt to use it to prove residency.\n\nMy husband said when he told the post office manager what had been happening, they would report it, but we haven't heard anything at all-- and as I mentioned, the mail in her name has increased since then. I tried calling the Post Inspector's hotline, but it went to voicemail and I've never gotten a response from any voicemail I left to them.\n\nI'm just kind of at a loss of what my next move should be? I just want this mess to be over.",

I assumed it was just a neighbor's guest or someone being picked up/dropped off. When we woke up around 6am the next morning, she was still there sleeping in the drivers seat, which is when I realized how creepy it was. \n\nWe began the paperwork for the restraining order but got caught up in other life junk and didn't get around to submitting it. I definitely should've made that more of a priority at the time. The things didn't seem so bad in isolation since they were all like 6-8 months apart, but now that I list them all in one thread......",

The first case was dismissed with prejudice, she refiled the same basic case and it was allowed to go forward while it was a quick dismissal there should be a request for costs, or even sanctions even though covered by title insurance you should not be \"paying\" to defend yourself against the same suit over and over as \"With Prejudice\" means never ever do this again.  Also, my guess is she is doing this without an attorney.  If she ever has representation you/your attorney should be filing a bar complaint against that attorney, they have a duty to research the validity of the action prior to signing there names on it.  If you are dragged to court again (and I bet you will) your attorney also should be asking the judge to take action on a Vexatious litigant.\n\nEverything you are doing in your story is correct and the proper way to proceed.  You will probably not get a lot of things to do beyond your current steps taken from this forum as you are already taking the proper steps.",

You should go down to the county recorder's office and get certified copies of these documents if you don't already have them.  Then, put them in a safety deposit box or some other safe location not in your home.  Likewise, you should obtain copies of the two dismissed housing court actions for your records.\n\nWith respect to this woman, you have a name - that means she can be located. If this harassment continues and the police don't bother to investigate properly, consider hiring a private investigator to locate her.  (In my experience, locates can cost less than $100) and have a lawyer send her a cease &amp; desist letter at that address.    \n\n\nUltimately, this woman is potentially mentally ill and for whatever reason cannot let go of the idea she owns her old home, still.  Maybe the foreclosure was unfair?  Doesn't matter, you're an innocent purchaser for value.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.992 13/71ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

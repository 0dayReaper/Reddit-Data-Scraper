    "postText": "Hey, i rented a car in Finland during holiday. The guy at the counter told me about some damages, so i guessed they are in the system. Anyway, luckily i made a video of the car before i drove off. After the holiday they sent me a receipt which was overpriced. After i told them what was too much on the receipt, i got a mail with the accousations. The amount was the maximum excess (1100 Euro) in the contract. Now they want me to fill out some forms, i just answered via mail that i have this video and they should tell me where to upload it. Anything else i should do right now or what i def should not do?\n\nThank you in advance.",

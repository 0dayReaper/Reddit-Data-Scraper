    "postText": "My aunt and uncle co-own a home in NY State with their Son and  Daughter-in-law.  They and Son and DIL are on deed.  The Son amd DIL are getting divorced and DIL is saying my aunt must sell so that the DIL can have her quarter of the equity.  As in MUST sell.  I thought divorce arrangements were as per negotiated and there are several ways for DIL to get her net due (considering whatever other assets and liabilities there are.) But if the couple cannot agree on a settlement would a court force a sale?",

It's unwise for unmarried people to co-own real estate but if they do, and one of them wants to sell it and the others disagree, then they sue them for a partition sale. Divorce or no divorce, marriage or no marriage.",

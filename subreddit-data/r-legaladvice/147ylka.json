    "postText": "I (22 F) lent my older brother (32 M) one of my cars and he is now refusing to give it back. I believe this constitutes it as being stolen. He is also an attorney (just graduated law school).\r  \n\r  \nBackground: We live in California. He was having troubles that are not my place to clarify on back in Northern California, so he moved down to Southern California (my city) to live with me for free for a month and use my second car to get back on his feet. My understanding is that he was going to have his friend who already lived in my town repair the engine of the car that he was going to use and THEN use the car as his primary vehicle, but this still has not happened. (This car was my project car, and I replaced everything on the car out of pocket with my own money and recently discovered this engine issue. So while the car still runs, the engine is bad.) In the beginning I frequently came home at random times of the day and would find that the car was no longer in it's designated parking spot. I would complain to him about this and while he kept up communications in the proper way for a short while (a week at most), he still kept crossing my boundaries with the car. One time he took the car back up to where he used to live (12 hours away) and did not tell me. He told my mom, who I don't get along with and has NO ownership over the car and felt that was sufficient notice to me.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAfter he got a job in my town, I let him use the car more regularly for work and earning income, but I told him that if he could not keep up proper communication lines then we would have to reevaluate the situation. He was disrespectful in this conversation, and I did not find out until recently that after this conversation he blocked me on all communication platforms. I only found out because I had to send him a message about his insurance coverage for the car not meeting my financing companies standards. He unblocked me yesterday after I told my mom I would be reporting the car stolen and said that he will not be communicating with me about the car again, that he will not tell me where the car is located/being stored, and he will not give me my car back until I give him $500 for things like gas, insurance and registration fees for the car. I understand giving back prorated registration fees, but I don't think I owe him money for things that are required for you to legally drive (insurance, gas). Not to mention he already had a free stay at my house and has not made any finance payments on the car, so I will still have to be paying that this month like I did last month. He says he only \"lived\" at my house for 5 days and all the other days he had his stuff stored at my property (which is considered living in the eyes of the law).\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI am at a lost at what to do and although I don't want my brother to be charged with Grand Theft Auto or Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle, I feel like I have no other options if he is blatantly holding my property hostage. He is a lawyer and I honestly feel like if he thinks I owe him money, he should sue me for it and return my property. A Landlord doesn't say to a tenant \"You're late on rent, so I'm locking all your belongings up until you pay me.\" Thoughts??",

He has expressly told you that he will not return the car or tell you where it is, in text.  \n\nCharges are unlikely here, but it can't hurt to see if you can get a local station to at least file a report.  You would specifically want this for insurance purposes, should he get into an accident.",

In your shoes, I'd just let him know that he doesn't have permission to use the car and if he doesn't return it by x date (maybe a week?) you're going to have to report it stolen.  Its very likely that police would brush it off as a civil matter, but hopefully he'd be able to put together the thin ice he's on \n\nReport or don't, but if you do report and he doesn't return the car, you don't have anywhere to escalate to that isn't going to cost more than the $500 he's asking for.",

It won't hurt to contact the police, sometimes this sub is overly pessimistic and you may be surprised.

Especially in California. \n\nFirst and foremost, you need to serve him with notice informing him that his permission to use the vehicle is being rescinded and he needs to make the vehicle available for you to pick up, or return it to you, within a reasonable period of time.",

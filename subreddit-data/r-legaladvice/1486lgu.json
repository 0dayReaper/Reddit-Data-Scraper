    "postText": "I\u2019m a small store owner and was served with a lawsuit by a former employee claiming they did not get paid overtime a couple of years ago. They are falsely making claims but they are suing for a huge amount that I cannot even afford in this lifetime. I have not been able to find any information on what small businesses should do in these situations. Are there any laws that protect us from such theft and false accusations? Do I sell my kidney to settle this? Actually 1 kidney wouldn\u2019t even pay the settlement my whole family would have to give a kidney each. I\u2019ve worked so hard for this life and I feel like my life is being snatched away from me. Just to get an attorney to fight my side would cost around $50K and high chances of losing. The system is so flawed. What can I do?",

Which they can't do if you didn't commit wage theft against them. Did you? \n\nTalk to a lawyer who can see, first of all, if this is within the statute of limitations. Perhaps it can be thrown out. Where are you located, and how many years ago?",

You committed various labor law violations and tax fraud too, but that doesn't mean he should profit off of it necessarily. And you'll eventually need to get your CPA involved. This is not some innocent situation that they are using to their own advantage. You need a lawyer.",

You can get their claims reduced to any legitimate claims. That's the court process. Are they suing in small claims court without an attorney, or in \"big boy\" court with an attorney?\n\n&gt; If I decide not to settle and go to court what\u2019s the process for that? Do we have to do a trial by jury?\n\nProbably not but it's possible. Probably a judge. More likely, you settle.",

    "postText": "I recently put in my two weeks notice at a job where I found out they classified \u201cemployees\u201d as self employed contractors and were paying me less than I earned . Within 48 hours of me demanding the money and explanation for myself and my subordinates I was conveniently relieved of my position . We are employees we don\u2019t have our own equipment, we do not make our own hours or business decisions . We are made to wear uniforms and speak to customers with dialogue they\u2019ve drawn up ahead of time . They refuse to take taxes out and every paycheck for every employee is always short . This was met with hostility when addressed with the owners / supervisors . All employees have been classified under the organization as self employed contractors with 1099 . Do I have a case for any sort of pay correction , damage costs from putting in hours I haven\u2019t been properly compensated for or possibly a lawsuit ? They have caused great financial difficulties in my life since employment and now I facing an eviction if my last weeks check this coming Friday isn\u2019t up to par . I\u2019ve already received a 5 day notice to pay or quit paying",

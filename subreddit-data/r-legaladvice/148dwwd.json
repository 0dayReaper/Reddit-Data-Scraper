    "postText": "It's looking like my mom is not my guardian like she has always told me because I called the courthouse and there are no records under mine or her name pertaining to guardianship. But she does handle all my medical stuff, etc.\n\nSo I was told even if my mom is not my legal guardian and has no authority over me, she can still call in a silver alert and have the cops bring me back home (if I leave home) because I'm officially diagnosed with a mental disability. Is this true?? After all, no guardianship proves I am my own person, right? And therefore can leave home like any other adult? I mean if I don't have a guardian wouldn't that mean I am a legal adult that can do as I wish, including leaving home? Because ain't the whole point of guardianship is when someone is incompetent so if I don't have a guardian, then I wouldn't be incompetent in the eyes of the authorities? Also if I did leave home, and my mom sent the cops after me, if I tell them she is not my guardian and that I am not under guardianship and that I left because I wanted to, could they legally and forcefully make me come back home against my will?\n\nWhen I say leave home, I'm referring to things like moving out or moving in with friend or even just getting out of the house for a few hours to hang out with a friend.\n\nAdditional question:\nIf my mom is not my guardian (but I'm officially diagnosed with a mental disability), can she press charges against someone for dating me or having sex with me? I mean in other words, if I'm not under guardianship, does that mean I'm legally capable of consent in the eyes of the law (despite being officially diagnosed with a mental disability)?\n\nBy the way, I am also on SSI and my mom is my payee and as I said, she does handle my medical stuff. But she is not my legal guardian.",

It would have been made clear to you by a judge what rights you were losing and you would have had a chance to argue that you did not want it. It does not sound like this happened.",

Not as much in what the police do in a given circumstance. \n\nCan mom start using the police as a taxi service every time you're not at home?  No.  For a lot of reasons.  But in a specific instance, what will police do when mom says you're a vulnerable person and you're not where you're supposed to be?  We just can't know.  Bringing you \"home\" isn't shocking or outrageous.  If home is also mom's home then they're bringing you back to her.",

If you went on SSI as a minor then makes sense she was the payee but if you are no longer a minor and are capable of handling your own money then those payments should be coming to you in your name, not hers.  You probably need to contact SSA about getting the payments in your name.  You should probably contact adult services and talk to social workers.  They may be able to assist you in getting housing and benefits.  If they think that you aren't capable of living on your own it may strengthen any case your mom is trying to make but would also let you know what types of obstacles you may encounter to trying to live independently.\n\nGetting a case worker with adult services can also assist with police encounters.  If mom calls and police make contact with you, you can let them know that you are fine and if they have any concerns they can talk to your caseworker.  Unfortunately if mom calls police and tells them that you are mentally disabled it will likely be on you to show police that you are capable of being on your own.  They will want to err on the side of keeping you safe and may return you to mom.",

Why not believe me over my mom? She says I'm incompetent but I say I'm not incompetent. Why not believe me instead of her? How do they decide whose word to believe? Because parents can lie too. Why would the police believe an adult who they've been told is mentally disabled? Because 1) said disabled adult is not under guardianship which should show the adult is not incompetent or else they would be under guardianship and 2) because parents lie (Dee Dee Blanchard comes to mind). Also if they believe the person who says \"she's incompetent and vulnerable\" and not the person who says \"I'm not incompetent or vulnerable\" then anyone can say that about anyone (their adult son/daughter, their spouse, their roommate, etc.) to have cops bring someone back to them against the person's will, which is why it's important to believe the person who says \"I'm not incompetent or vulnerable\" because it can be misused and used to one's advantage.",

Guardianship should be the deciding factor because if someone isn't under guardianship then they're obviously not incompetent. Mentally disabled don't always equal incompetent but guardianship does. And not all mentally disabled adults are under guardianship. Some mentally disabled adults are married and got kids. By the way, I'm not trying to be rude or a smart ass. I just don't understand how my mom can claim I'm incompetent and vulnerable and have the cops bring me back based on that if she is not my guardian since no guardianship should mean I'm not incompetent and am my own person.",

    "postText": "I work for a construction company and I\u2019m currently on a decent sized housing project in a downtown area of a major city. And theft has been so bad. We can\u2019t keep anything on site, materials or tools and any work we do during the day gets ruined at night. 1 step forward 2 steps back situation. We hired a professional security company but they don\u2019t even carry pepper spray and they just sit in their cars at night and if they get out and walk it\u2019s not even a full site walk. I\u2019m partly convinced they\u2019re part of the problem. I have filed so many police reports and they\u2019ve come out a couple times but for the most part they don\u2019t give a damn. We have security cameras on the outside but all it does is shows guys breaking in to the building but the cops won\u2019t follow up with any investigation. \n\nAnyways, I decided to stay around a couple nights this week through the night to try and scare off some of the offenders. I have a couple cans of bear spray and and some gloves but that\u2019s all as far as my self defense gear. I\u2019m just checking to see if I actually do get into a conflict, if I will get in trouble or not.",

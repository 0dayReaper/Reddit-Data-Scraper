    "postText": "My ex and I were together for almost 5 years. We have a child together. \nWe separated just before new year and my mother passed away late January and left me everything she owned. \n\nFast forward 1.5 years later and we are just getting around to selling the home we purchased and sorting out custody of our child. \n\nIn the letter from the lawyer I received they are requesting my pay slips, my bank accounts with detailed transaction history, my super balance etc. \nIn the letter it stated \"our client advised your mother recently passed away\" and are asking for all of the information regarding my mother's stuff. \nPreviously my ex stated she wanted half of the money from my mother's stuff/house. \n\nI know any money or property I own has to be taken into account when splitting assets etc, I don't care about that. Can she take anything from my mother's belongings or will I just be able to give her money and keep my mothers stuff?",

For more complete advice you should consult a family court lawyer.",

    "postText": "Hello, the seller of our house signed up for tax assessment service before I bought the house. The tax assessment service supposedly reduced my tax liability. The seller forwarded this doc saying my tax is reduced  and I should pay them or him so he can pay them. I'm not even sure my tax bill got reduced and not sure what impact it has on my future taxes. Due to the increased in property value recentlu and there being a cap on how much county can increase tax bill, we have a reduced assessment value than what I paid for. Any advice?",

My guess is the seller did this before the sale, had to pay for it (generally they charge you a % of the $$ they saved you by having your valuation lowered) and is trying to see if they can recoup their money. Most likely the actual assessment has been updated to whatever results the service got and OP can ignore the seller.",

This is a simple matter of filing some forms with the tax assessor's office which these people do for homeowners on a regulars basis. They usually have a rapport with the town/city tax clerk which makes the process go smoothly.\n\nMost municipalities have limits on how often you can apply for a lower assessment, and there is no guarantee that in the next few years your assessment will not jump over the previous one, increasing your tax burden.",

You\u2019re only proper course of action here really is to reach out to them and ask how to handle this. \n\nMy understanding of the situation is the previous owner used a grievance service which battles the county to lower your property tax for the following year. They charge you this percentage up front. So if for the upcoming tax year their grievance result will save you $5,000 and they charge a 30% fee, you owe $1,500 up front. As a result of this you\u2019ll save $3,500 ($5,000 - $1,500). Emphasis there is on YOU. The previous owner does not benefit from this, you do. There possibly should have been a transfer form for you to sign from the company they used so that communication goes through you. \n\nBtw you can do grievances yourself if you wish to save the fee. In NY it\u2019s standard practice to grieve every tax season, it\u2019s a racket. The companies that charge a percentage only charge you if are successful, which is a nice deal imo. \n\nAlso u/Ok-Education-3926 mentioned, make sure you apply for the STAR credit. \n\n\nsources:\n\ngeneral process\nhttps://www.maidenbaumtax.com/how-it-works\n\nsome places charge as low as 30%\nhttps://propertytaxbuster.com/",

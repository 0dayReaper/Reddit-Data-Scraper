    "postText": "i am 14 years old, my other family members want to go to cps for this and i\u2019m scared my mom will get very mad if this doesn\u2019t work out so i want to make sure this is cps material. \nfor all of my life my mom has had bed bugs, everywhere. i mean everywhere, i can\u2019t sleep anymore and it\u2019s getting to me, she will not get rid of them. when i was 5-11 i would get bit up so much, my beds had no sheets and i would see them everywhere, i would wake up with one in my mouth, all over me. sometimes in my ears it was really weird. i found one in my charging port once, and now my family is lying to me and saying they have got rid of them all, they have not i still see them, i don\u2019t get bit up anymore but it really bothers me and keeps me from sleeping because i see them and i feel them all over me. the house isn\u2019t in very good shape either, my mom has tore up our couch looking for bugs, i mean tore it up !! the house is a mess, the kitchen has dirty dishes everywhere, spoiled food and just disgusting stuff a child should not see. is this cps material please someone tell me.",

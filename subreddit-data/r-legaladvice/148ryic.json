    "postText": "Hello! My girlfriends grandfather served one of his tenants an eviction notice on the 6th of May. Ohio laws (as far as I know) say there needs to be a minimum 30 day eviction notice. He showed up on the 6th of this month to make sure they were gone and they weren\u2019t. It has been a week since they were supposed to be gone and they still haven\u2019t left. Her grandfather showed up to the house with the police, but they are saying the most they can do is go to court, but I thought if the 30 days passed, they got what they could and then left because they had ample time to get something figured out. Any advice?",

            "comment": "Ohio attorney here (but not yours). Ohio is pretty tenant friendly and it seems like the tenants know that so your gf\u2019s grandfather is probably going to have to go by the book to do a proper eviction. \n\nI\u2019m going to assume the tenant was on a month-to-month lease because if there is a written lease it may change some generic advice. Other posters are correct about the 30-day notice period being 30 days past the next periodic rental due date. So if the tenant usually pays on the 1st then they\u2019d have until 7/1. But if they are supposed to pay on the 15th it could be 6/15 instead. Regardless, once that period is up, if the tenant is still not out, then he has to serve them a second notice at least 3-days before filing eviction that tells the tenant an eviction is going to be filed. \n\nAll that being said, if there\u2019s another reason for eviction, such as nonpayment of rent, your gf\u2019s grandfather should be able to go ahead and do a 3-day notice now.\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend your gf\u2019s grandfather hire an attorney to go through this. Evictions are all about procedure but are relatively simple so it\u2019s possible to get a lawyer for one relatively cheap.",

            "comment": "Some states consider the advance notice period to be calendar days from an arbitrary day of notice.   In California, for example, a \"30 day\" notice given on May 6 would end the tenancy on June 5 (presuming all the other factors were also followed).\n\nBut in Ohio, the notice has to be given\n\n&gt;to the other at least thirty days prior to the periodic rental date.\n\nThe \"periodic rental date\" is the next day that rent is due.   So a notice given on May 6 would not be valid for termination at the end of May (25 days) but rather at the end of June.\n\n&gt;I thought if the 30 days passed, they got what they could and then left because they had ample time to get something figured out. \n\nNo.   The expiration of the notice period just allows the property owner to file an eviction suit in court.    He has to win that suit, allow for appeal, and then get an eviction order that allows him to take possession or have the Sheriff remove the tenants if they don't leave.\n\nIf your girlfriend's grandfather doesn't understand these basic mechanisms of being a housing provider, he needs to hire an attorney to do evictions for him.",

    "postText": "So this is honestly so small it probably doesn't matter in terms of there is nothing I can do but man it is the principal of the thing.  So I live in a state with sports betting.  I got an email that there was a free bonus bet if I logged in on Saturday.  I did that and went to place a bet using the bonus bet.  This app defaults to a $50 bet every time.  I went in and selected the bonus confirmed it and placed the bet.  As soon as I had it said I bet $50.  I went to go cash out, I cant.  Ok so I search for who to contact.  It took about 10 mins of searching but finally found a number and an email address.  Call the number, no one answers.  Email stating their system messed up and I would like to pull the bet, I even state if it were to win if this is not resolved then before the results on Sunday I don't want the winnings as I didn't make the bet.  The email me backing saying they cant find me in the system.  My iphone had sent from Icloud email, so I responded back immediately Sunday morning from the correct email stating the email in it as well.  They responded with the same email saying they cant find me so I reply back stating that is the email.  After the bet is settled they email saying sorry its settled nothing we can do.  I forward again the original email and get the same thing back.  There is a different number on the email they send so I call them today.  They tell me the same thing even though I have time stamped emails showing it was sent well prior and a call that wasn't answered.  I asked if I had done the chat option and told them there is not one on the app.  After a 30 min phone call am told sorry nothing they can do the bet is settled.\n\nLook at get its only $50 and honestly that's not really that much money.  Its the fact there app messed up and they refused to do their job to find me before the bet was settled and refuse to do anything now that it is.   That type of customer service just drives me crazy because honestly they stole from me.  Is there anything at all I can do not even so much to get back the money but that this doesn't happen to people in the future.  Thanks for reading my pretty much pointless rant.",

            "comment": "&gt;I live in a state with sports betting.\n\nNice for you.   Is the sports book you placed your bonus bet with headquartered in the same state ?\n\n&gt;As soon as I had it said I bet $50. I went to go cash out, I cant.\n\nDid the sporting event on which the wager was based occur ?   Or do you mean that you want to cancel your bet before it does ?\n\n&gt;it's only $50 \n\nHow do you figure you had a loss:  because you think you should have been able to cancel the bet before the event on which it was based ?    I'm not clear if you placed a $50 cash bet and a \"free\" bonus bet and wanted to cancel one or both.\n\n&gt;honestly they stole from me\n\nYou were literally risking your money on sports wagers, so I'm not sure I see larceny or fraud here.\n\nYou could try to sue them for some kind of violation of their terms and conditions if they promise a timely retraction of wagers.   But it's very complex to sue corporations, especially if they are foreign ones to your state.   And the amount of money at stake makes it very impractical.",

                    "comment": "No it is located in a different state.\n\nThe sporting event did occur.  I was trying to cancel before it happened.\n\nI went to place the bonus bet and clicked to apply it.  Instead of doing that it put through a bet of $50.\n\nFair.  I would say my point from that was I would not have placed this bet with my money.  Now with the free $10 bonus bet sure.  \n\nYeah honestly that is what I figured.  According to their terms I had 15 minutes to cancel.  But I guess email doesn't work for that since they say they will respond in 24 to 48 hours.  The number i called I assume was already closed for the day and there was no chat option.  Its more of a justice thing than getting the money back but I still don't see a way that it is practical.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an illustrator and designer that creates \"imaginary plants/botanicals\" and flora and fauna art. I was made aware by an IG follower that Old Navy is using my copyrighted work without my permission. I have the illustration registered with the US Copyright Office, but I'm afraid nothing can be done because they changed the leaves and removed one of the petals.\n\nFor reference, I did not base this flower off of another plant or flower and I created it as one of my \u201cimaginary botanicals\u201d.\n\nI want to send a cease and desist and request compensation. Licensing the use of my work is how I make a living. Using my work without my permission and payment deprives me of income, so I feel the request is fair. \n\nI know it may be a long shot, but please let me know if I am within my rights to send a cease and desist and to ask for compensation.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I am looking for an attorney. I wanted to check with the community to see if you also felt my work was being infringed upon. It's validating to hear everyone's feedback, and I appreciate all the advice, info, and support! xo\n\n[old navy](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=655280012&amp;vid=1#pdp-page-content)\n\n[my art](https://www.highwestwild.com/products/leonie-art-print-1?_pos=1&amp;_psq=leonie&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0)",

The fact that you registered your art hugely plays in your favor.\n\nYou can try to send a registered cease and desist and demand letter yourself first and see how they respond.",

This is your property that you believe was stolen (and, for what it\u2019s worth, I think so too) so the advice on self-help is so wrong that it\u2019s borderline criminal. \n\nYou have every advantage and reaching out with your own C&amp;D waives all of that. Really, you should nuke this thread as well.\n\nYou know how lawyers always advise \u201cdon\u2019t talk to the police, you will just incriminate yourself?\u201d The same applies when dealing with an adverse party when that party is represented and you are not. \n\nI started my career as an attorney in the IP group at a large apparel brand. We operated on the up and up, but at the end of the day we protect our employer, not artists. \n\nLook, I\u2019m sorry if it came across as condescending but at the end of the day the top answers here are bad advice. I wouldn\u2019t let Old Navy know you think you\u2019ve been wronged until you know what the strategy is, what the value is, and what you\u2019d accept as fair settlement. \n\nI also am confident you\u2019ll find plenty of folks ready to take this with no out of pocket costs for you. Or, if the experts disagree and think this isn\u2019t theft or infringement, they won\u2019t charge you for that consultation.",

It will add insult to injury.  NAL but was a designer for several big companies and yah, lazy designers use small artist inspiration and generally know to change enough not to be able to legally get in trouble plus the company has in house lawyers to fight it if it ever got to litigation. They are pushing it though because of the colors being the same but shapes and details are different enough, esp petals, that this isn\u2019t a clear infringement based on my schooling and experience with learning about graphic design copyright.\n\nhttps://www.epgdlaw.com/how-can-my-artwork-steer-clear-of-copyright-infringement/",

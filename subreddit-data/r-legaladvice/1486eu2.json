I haven't yet retrieved it because I don't want to go to their house. My mom is claiming after 30 days they are property of the owners of the house, is this true? I have receipts for the items.",

Depending on where you are, the rules for landlords claiming property abandoned by a former tenant vary -- but almost all US states require the landlord to give notice to the tenant that the property is being held for pickup, and then only after the notice is ignored could they consider it abandoned property.\n\nIf they did notify you and you've been reluctant to go back, that may complicate things.  They aren't likely to be obligated to bring it to you -- only to make it available for you to pick it up.\n\nIf you try to make arrangements to pick it up and they refuse, you can try to sue them. Whether or not you can sue them to force them to return the property or sue them for monetary value depends on where you're located.",

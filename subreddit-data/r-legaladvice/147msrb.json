    "postText": "We are in an interminable house purchase in the UK.\n\nThe sellers are the siblings of the former owner. \n\nShe was murdered by her estranged husband (over her refusal to sell the home). He has been convicted and the sellers have a court order removing him from the title.\n\nThey had a mortgage with Santander. Our solicitor maintains that until the lender provides consent, the Land Registry will not process the application to transfer the title to us. Their solicitor maintains this is not a problem.\n\nBecause this has taken months to progress, we've had to refresh searches, and are in danger of our hard fought mortgage offer expiring. The sellers have decided to remarket the property for 10% more, depsite the UK market actually falling, and the delays sitting with their solicitor.\n\nWe are stuck waiting for a mortgage lender we have no relationship with to complete a bit of administration that we aren't 100% sure is needed. Our lawyers say it is, theirs say it isn't and we're stuck in stalemate with \u00a3000's already sunk into the purchase and a place for our young family to live at risk. (our current landlords are choosing to sell the place we rented 'short term' whilst our purchase was progressed)",

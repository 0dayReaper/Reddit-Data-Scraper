    "postText": "Hello, I traded in a car (2018 accord) for an older one with lower insurance (2011 crv) and was told by the \u201cbusiness\u201d department that after all adjustments I\u2019d be getting a $6100 check for the difference in value.\n\nToday the check arrived and it was $4885. Trying to contact anyone at the dealership and I\u2019m getting radio silence, no call backs. \n\nDo I need to take this to small claims court? They haven\u2019t even sent me my copies of the sales paperwork. Tomorrow I\u2019ll be in that area and will stop by in person but I imagine they will have no clue as to what I\u2019m talking about.",

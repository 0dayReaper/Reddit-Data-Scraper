    "postText": "Myself and my two children lived with my parents for approx 7 years (2013-2020). \n\nI offered to pay rent when I first moved back in, they refused me. \nI went back to college (paid for through grants and scholarships) and offered to work while in college to pay rent, they refused me. \n\nAny time previously when I would bring up if I needed to pay them back their answer has always been \"no\". Now that my spouse and I are married and are no longer allowing them access to our children, my parents are insisting that I pay back $225k over the next 7 years. \n\nThere was never a verbal or written agreement between myself and my parents regarding payment. \n\nDo they have any legal grounds to act upon to recover said amount?",

My father would just hand it to me and insist I take the kids to get some ice cream with it. Each time I would earn some money from babysitting, I would try to pay him back, but he would refuse to take the money.",

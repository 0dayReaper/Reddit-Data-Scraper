My fianc\u00e9 and I signed the lease 1/26/23 but while cleaning it on weekends to move in, I had a baby 2/24. We were staying at FILs house during that time. We didn\u2019t move in until after 3/15, because it has stairs and I was post partum. After a good two months of living at the apartment, we began to look into maintenance. It\u2019s a 2006 Luxury complex, but it has cheap and shoddy maintance. Caulking everywhere is old, hard, discoloured and the grout in the bathrooms isn\u2019t sealed so it crumbles when you walk on it. You get the picture. \n\nMold Time:\n5/25   While looking around for any issues, I checked the air conditioning unit that we have in the center of our apartment. Immediately, after opening up the vent you are met with this strong, musty, fresh rain, smell. The coils on it are covered in mold and dust. You can\u2019t even see the coils or any resemblance. It looks like the mold had a durag and successfully got the best waves. I wish I was joking. I emailed them 5/29 about this but got no response until today, 6/12. I was able to get the new manager to look at it today, but she insisted that it\u2019s only dust and it\u2019s normal. I know that dust isn\u2019t black and moist. In a spare bedroom closet where we keep baby clothes, the vent flaps have small black dots on it that we believe resembles mold. That scared us out of there. Currently, we\u2019ve been back at FILs since 5/29. \n\nI\u2019m trying to get out of the lease due to unsafe living conditions but I don\u2019t know how to do all of that confidently. We found an HVAC company that can inspect and test for mold. I already got confirmation through word of mouth from the manager, that they can come onto property and test but they\u2019ll call her personally to confirm tomorrow morning. \n\nTLDR; Apt Mgmt trying to gaslight us by telling us its only dust and normal. We want out of the lease &amp; HVAC company to test within the next few days. How do we go about this? What else can we do from here? Is there anything else I should be informed about before going further?",

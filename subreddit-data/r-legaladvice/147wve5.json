    "postText": "Hello all, I am new here in the country and I ordered a vehicle through a car buyers agency. They help people who are new to the county (USA). The agency helped me choose a vehicle that would best fit me. I chose a vehicle that had all the features I wanted and I signed for the vehicle.  \n\nFast forward, the vehicle finally arrived, and it is missing the blind spot monitors and parking sensors. Apparently, the car manufacture had a shortage of units and a select few vehicles got chosen not to have them. \n\nThe agency received a $750 credit from the dealer to give to me but I refuse to accept it since this is not the car I purchased and signed for. They keep insisting to accept the money that they even raised it to $1200. What should I do? I do not want a vehicle that does not meet my standard, as this is a big investment for me.",

The manufacturers have a shortage of units and so they are delivering some vehicles without these optional parts, as they will **deliver and install them later**.  You likely aren't being denied the parts, just delayed.  \n\nHaving said that, regardless of whether I am right or you are, your options are pretty clear.  You certainly don't have to accept delivery if you don't want to; but your option is not to take a car at all or not take this car until the parts arrive.  The parts don't exist; there's no way you can make them arrive now.",

Presumably, you signed a contract with the car buyers agency, which would specify any right of refusal, if your criteria are grounds to turn down the vehicle, etc., including whether you purchased a vehicle with specific features or packages.",

I'm going to guess that it spells out Make, Model, Trim, and Option Package Codes (e.g. a CarCo FastCar XL-B w/ Nifty Package B, RoboCar Package C, and Deluxe Profit Center A) and did not spell out individual pieces and parts.\n\nIt's not really the fault of the broker or the dealer that the manufacturer is suffering from the same supply-chain issues affecting the entire industry.  Your remedy here is going to be to not buy the car; you can't force them to install the parts that don't exist, either now or later.",

My father died 4 months ago and I am in charge of his estate (which is not much and being probated at this time). Do I have a legal obligation to call them back?",

            "comment": "No.\n\nDid you file a notice of publication (about the estate being opened) in a local newspaper so that creditors will know where to send a claim for payment?\n\nThey technically should be submitting a creditor's claim to the executor for payment of this debt, IF they are familiar with that procedure.  If they file a claim, you will take it into consideration to either pay it or deny it.\n\nIf they don't file an official creditor's claim, then you don't have to do anything about that debt.\n\nYou are not legally obligated to call them back.  If you reasonably expect that there are not enough assets in the estate to pay this debt, then you can send them a letter that the estate is insolvent and that unfortunately, their bill will have to remain unpaid.",

    "postText": "I saw a therapist and a psychologist for five years. I paid a copay for the visits and insurance paid for the rest. Apparently, in the last two years of the visits the Insurance started \"refusing\" to pay. Apparently, they have told the doctor's office it is \"patient responsibility\". I have not had a chance to talk to the insurance company. It was so long ago I don't even know what insurance I had.\n\nI had a balance of \"$700\". When I asked for a detailed invoice it magically went down to $600. The invoice says \"automatic adjustment\" every couple of weeks and magically adds 90 dollars. Then I pay my $60 copay. Then it's magically $90 extra dollars again. This eventually adds up to $600 something. I was not once told my doctor's visits were costing more than $60 dollars. Nor was I told I had a balance. When I mentioned I was never told I had a balance she told me it was not the front desk responsibility to tell me about my balance. \n\nThey are claiming they've been contacting me for years. They have threatened me over the phone and told me if I didn't pay it now they would continue to call me and would eventually send it to collections. I spoke with billing and she continued to try to bully me to make a payment that day. I asked to see the invoice and hung up. Unfortunately, I was not recording this call. I had no idea who was calling me to start the recording. \n\nIs there such thing as a medical invoice lawyer? How do I about finding one? I have high suspicion that these invoices are altered due to their shady billing and customer service representatives.",

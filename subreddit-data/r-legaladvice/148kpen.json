    "postText": "I paid the last two months of my lease early to be able to move due to documented harassment from a neighbor. The lease was for an apartment in Shelby County, Tennessee.  The landlord has re-rented the unit to a new tenant and their lease overlaps mine by a month and a half. \n\nMy lease stated that the early termination fee would be 3 months of rent and security deposit forfeiture but the property management company \u201cgraciously\u201d let me pay two months since that was all that was left on my contract. They\u2019ve now sent me a disposition letter saying they owe me the security deposit (minus a cleaning fee).  This reads to me like they aren\u2019t treating it as an \u201cearly termination\u201d now. \n\nI found the below quote online and it applies to my county:\n\n\u201cIf you don't have a legal justification to break your lease, the good news is that you may still be off the hook for paying all the rent due for the remaining lease term. This is because under Tennessee law (Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 66-28-507 (c)), landlords must make reasonable efforts to re-rent your unit- no matter what your reason for leaving-rather than charge you for the total remaining rent due under the lease. So you may not have to pay much, if any additional rent, if you break your lease. You need pay only the amount of rent the landlord loses because you moved out early. This is because Tennessee requires landlords of larger counties to take reasonable steps to keep their losses to a minimum--or to \"mitigate damages\" in legal terms. (By larger county, we mean counties having a population of more than 75,000; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 66-28-102 for details.)\u201d\n\nI\u2019m curious if I\u2019m entitled to a month and a half of rent that I paid since the unit has been re-rented and the new tenant will also pay rent for that time period.",

If he's charged he'll get a year of probation with conditions largely to obey the rules of school and home and no new crimes, and that's assuming that county doesn't do consent decrees that result in an outright dismissal upon successful completion.\n\nI'll say this though: if he's charged you're going to find a lot of lawyers who will tell you they can represent him in juvenile court better than the public defender's office can because they handle adult criminal cases. Don't listen to them. Juvenile law is a completely different statute section, and much of what's done in adult court is not remotely handled the same way there. It is rare that you'll find a private lawyer who knows the law better than a PD.",

Hes also doing something that every single 13 year old I knew did at one point in their life, it\u2019s really not the end of the world. He\u2019ll be fine, probably needs to pay a fine and do some volunteer work.\n\nThis will not effect his future.  Turning it into a huge deal probably will though. Relax.",

She added her partner to the deed of her home, the relationship has ended, and he refuses to let her buy him out or him buy her out.  But he\u2019s also refusing realtors and has already ruined one pending offer to purchase.  He is harassing her, calling up to 20 times in a matter of 2 hours, refuses to remove all of his belongings, making very vague threats, etc.  What can or should she do?",

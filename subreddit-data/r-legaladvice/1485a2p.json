    "postText": "So, my uncle had a temper tantrum a few years ago and disinherited everyone but his daughter and his grand nieces and nephews. As in, if his daughter predeceases him (unlikely) these grandnieces/nephews inherit. \n\nMORE grandnieces/nephews were born since then. All are minors. In the unlikely event he dies after his daughter and the grandnieces/nephews are still children, would there be a way to distribute among that generation including the younger children born after the will? Or could the parents where some children are beneficiaries and others are not use the money for a common good that all children benefit from? Donate to charity on the children's  behalf? \n\nI have no idea if this is $100 or $1m that we are talking about. Probably in the middle. \n\nAs a parent of children born both before and after the will, I sincerely hope my cousin lives a long and happy life and it never becomes an issue.  I'm just curious as to what could be done for the sake of equity among the children (and, crucially, avoid a riff among them) in the unlikely event it did come to pass.",

The grandkids are not owed anything in any case. \n\n&gt; The intent was\n\nDoesn't matter. But, he's perfectly free to revise his will now. If not? A will is a sacred thing. You can't go in and rewrite one. If you could, then a will would have no purpose.\n\nIf the will says \"to all my grandchildren\" then it doesn't matter who is born or not. If it says \"Daisy, Harold, and Chester\" then they get it all. Be they adults, minors, or whatever. It would not be legal to do anything otherwise. And judges, courts, and lawsuits do not look kindly on people who do. \n\nRemember also: *none* of us have a right to any inheritance whatsoever, aside from spouses. Not even direct children.",

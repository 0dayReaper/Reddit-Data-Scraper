We have no desire to go public and we do not want this story of sexual harassment to be attached to our daughter forever. Please leave us alone.\n\nAnd to the person who messaged me and told me I should have never had children and that I'm taking feminism back a step, please reconsider your feeling of entitlement over my daughter's body, time, and life. Going public would have lasting ramifications for her social life and self esteem, particularly if subjected to internet trolls and the like. She is not obligated to dedicate the entirety of her emotional energy to an internet phenomenon. We are handling this without the media.",

If someone walked up to the principal and grabbed his balls, would he say \"Well, I didn't say you couldn't\"?\n\nThe people telling you that the principal's mandated reporter obligation was triggered are correct.  If other students were grabbing your daughter in intimate areas either above or below the waist, then Wisconsin defines that as sexual contact.  If she is 17, and it was non-consensual, then it triggers mandated reporter rules in Wisconsin, even if was another student.  Failure to report in Wisconsin can result in up to six months in jail and a revocation of the principal's license.  In other words, in addition to whatever hot mess these kids are in, the principal has committed a misdemeanor and the kind of mistake that can get him blacklisted.\n\nPlease note, you face no legal jeopardy.  You're not a mandated reporter.  The principal is.  We literally take training over this every year a) to remind us of this and b) to give HR a reason to fire us with cause if things ever go south.\n\nIn reality, will he go to jail over this?  Probably not.  But it gives you lots of room to maneuver.\n\nExternally, your next visits are to the police and to a lawyer for a free consultation.  Internally, your next visit is to the principal's direct superior, who doubtless would like to know what his employee has been up to and who might have a thing or two to say about any possible expulsion hearing.  In my district, the title you're looking for is \"School Support Officer\", but it might be different for you.\n\nI suggest the lawyer first, as for a small fee, they could be convinced to write a very persuasive letter to the SSO.",

Just get ready for fallout.\n\nWent to the worst school system in the worst state in the country for most of my time there.  Mom was a teacher there whole career.  About lost her mind trying to make things better.  Lots of worse stories of kids and administration.    \n\nThe main thing I learned is nobody will do a thing to help your kid and they threatened to punish her for defending herself in a really appropriate manner.

Usually there is a sentence about apparel that is deemed offensive or causes the disruption of the learning environment cannot be wor, and if worn the specific steps to deal with it. The admin threatening expulsion is to me a very poor example of clear thinking and communication in addressing your daughter\u2019s initial complaint of sexual harassment not being addressed properly. Find out what the school district\u2019s routine complaint compliance process is. Make a text document noting each and every incident of your daughter being groped, by whom, when, where and how she responded, all communication with staff and admin and all phone calls, texts, emails. Forward all documentation to each school board member, the superintendent and state your concern over the lack of respectful timely response to your daughter being harassed and the threat of expulsion.

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

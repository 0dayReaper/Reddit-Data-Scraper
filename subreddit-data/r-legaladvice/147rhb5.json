    "postText": "Hi i\u2019m from the Uk and purchased a 2nd hand car.\n\nMy issues that have happened with the car are due to it being previously modified. I didn\u2019t know it had been modified and now due to the lower springs used my suspension has completely failed and almost the whole thing needs replacing, which is racking me a bill of \u00a35,000 and the dealership changed my tyres on the car before they sold it to me. The tyres on the car are wrong which they put on and have been a mix of summer and winter which the main dealer has claimed to be extremely dangerous.\n\nThe dealership which I purchased the car from gave me a 12 month warranty and are claiming no responsibility for anything.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Considering the car had been sold to me badly modified which caused the entire suspension to fail within 400 miles of use and them putting the wrong tyres in the car making it dangerous?",

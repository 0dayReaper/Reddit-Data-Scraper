    "postText": "When I (24f) filed for divorce, I filed that I wanted to split the debt of the 2 cards my ex (41m) was on, I have a few other debts that he convinced me to take out (it was an abusive relationship, long story) but I didn't bother claiming those because I know it is hard to prove financial abuse. One of the cards is one I had before we were together, but his name is on it and I can't take it off (I've tried), the other one is a small one I got when we were together, he was an \"authorized user\" and had a card, but it was easy to remove him when we split. He countered with wanting to \"either agree to pay our own debts, or split everything down the middle\" and claimed credit cards I'd never seen, as well as some $1,500 phone cancelation thing I didn't know existed. These were only ever in his name, and I only asked that he pay debts of mine that his name was also on. I don't know what to do next, I don't have the means to get a lawyer, and I don't have family support. I barely make enough to cover my own debt, so there's no way I can take on his as well, especially when my name isn't on it. What are my resources or next steps?",

You will want hi to prove that any debts he tries to bring to the table were acquired during your marriage.  If you name is on a card you can stop future use.  If nothing else, report the card lost.  Cut it up and throw it away.  Call the company and tell them is is lost. Tell them you don't want a replacement.",

Try to catch him confessing he kept it hidden from you. Look through your texts and mail, possibly even arrange with your lawyer to bait him into sending a text. DO NOT TEXT HIM WITHOUT YOUR LAWYERS APPROVAL. \n\n4. Find anything that you can use as evidence that he lied about other stuff during your relationship. \n\n5. Lawyer up.",

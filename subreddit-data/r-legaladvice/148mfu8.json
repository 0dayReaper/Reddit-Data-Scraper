    "postText": "Looking for clarification on trademarks and satire.\n\nLets say I'm making a sticker that says \"I'm going to post this to TikTok\" or some other social media platform. Just text, and not defamitory. Obviously a site like Etsy could shut that down if they felt like it, but is that actually trademark violation?\n\nAnother example could be if I wanted to make a sticker or shirt depicting the GOP elephant or DNC donkey in a satirical way.\n\nAppreciate anyone who takes the time to clear this up.",

            "comment": "It's not at all clear that your proposed sticker is satirical, so yes, that's likely a trademark violation.\n\n\"Satire\" and \"parody\" are actual things with definitions.  It's not just a joke, or a meme, or a reference - it must have some sort of commentary on the thing you are referencing.  \n\nYour proposed sticker doesn't seem to have any satirical elements to it. It just references a social media site.  So the owners of the site in question could take issue with your use of their trademarked name and sue, and they would have a relatively decent (not guaranteed) chance of winning.",

Indeed they might seek to protect their use of the mark.  Will they?  We can\u2019t know.  If your sticker says \u201cI love Star Wars\u201d you\u2019re likely to be sued. Other companies defend their marks the minimum they believe is necessary to prevent dilution and ultimately value the free word of mouth.  \n\nYour use of the emblems of the Republican or Democratic Party would be quite different.",

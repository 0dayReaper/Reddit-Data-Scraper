    "postText": "I work in biotech within the United States and was recently contacted by a recruiter from a competitor. This role would be a promotion and substantial pay increase, along with some other benefits including more flexible work arrangements. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t have a non compete, I do work on a team who\u2019s results and actions have significant stock implications. This other job would be for a direct competitor in the same therapeutic area and product class, so it does make me nervous.\n\n\nAm I being overly worried, or can I some get get in trouble. On one hand, I feel I have the fight to work wherever I want since there\u2019s no non-complete. Yet, I do have information that only my small team would know and can meaningfully impact strategy",

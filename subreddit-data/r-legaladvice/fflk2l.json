    "postText": "Thought I\u2019d update you all since so many people offered advice in the original post yesterday.\n\nBrief summary of what happened: Neighborhood kid left his phone in my grass while I was mowing and I mowed it by mistake. The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.\n\nWell she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I\u2019d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn\u2019t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that\u2019s how she keeps track of him.\n\nI told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I\u2019d give him the phone.\n\nHe instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he\u2019d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.\n\nLeft and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)\n\nI had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.\n\nI had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won\u2019t always work out like this.\n\nI also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I\u2019ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) \n\nHe again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he\u2019d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I\u2019d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve done the right thing and didn\u2019t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn\u2019t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.\n\nThanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.992 13/71ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

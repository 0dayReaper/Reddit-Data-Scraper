    "postText": "Bought a truck at a dealership. 3.5 weeks later they need me to come in because they said there was a mess up on the contract I signed and the bank I signed the loan for denied the loan. All they said so far is it\u2019s 5 dollars less a month.\n\nWhat should I look for to protect myself and at this point do I need to sign the new loan or can I just say no here\u2019s the truck back and I\u2019ll take my down payment back? \n\nNot very happy with what\u2019s going on.",

If you do though, you will likely be on the hook for a per day rental rate for the 3.5 weeks  you had the truck.\n\nIt's not the dealership's fault if your loan gets denied. You can go in there with a check from a bank you source yourself if you prefer.",

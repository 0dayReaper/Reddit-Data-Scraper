    "postText": "CONTEXT: I live in NYS. My roommate owes nearly $4000 in rent to our landlord. We co-signed the lease and I have written proof of our agreement to share rent. I also have bank statements showing that they paid in the beginning of the lease. They are supposed to move out in the coming weeks, but haven\u2019t given me a date, but I am considering suing if they haven\u2019t paid by then.\n\nHESITATION: My roommate has powerful lawyers. What if they try to retaliate? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, but I can\u2019t afford a counterclaim if their lawyers are able to invent something against me.\n\nAny advice from anyone who has been through a similar case?\n\nThankyou!",

They would take you both to small claims for the unpaid rent, you would show up, your roommate likely would not, and the judge would order payment. That being said, since they are *also* on the lease they are responsible for all contractual agreement in said lease as well. \n\n&gt;My roommate has powerful lawyers. What if they try to retaliate? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, but I can\u2019t afford a counterclaim if their lawyers are able to invent something against me.\n\n$4000 is small claims territory and, depending on state, lawyers do not represent for small claims. That doesn't stop them from seeking counsel from their lawyers. If your roommate does not show on the court date, the judge will issue a default judgement. Collecting from your roommate is another thing entirely, but court orders certainly help.\n\nAlso, this is all assuming your roommate seeks legal counsel AND that attorney counsels them to not pay the rent owed rent.",

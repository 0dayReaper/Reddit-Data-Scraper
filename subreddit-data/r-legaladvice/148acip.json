    "postText": "Chicago Il, I was at a bar I had never been to before, I was drinking, but by no means was I drunk or belligerent. I tried to use the bathroom (single person bathroom) but the bouncer wouldn't let me go without having the door open. I took exception to that and shut the door. Well chaos ensued and the end result was 3 bouncers dragging me forcefully out of the bathroom onto the street. I knew my arm was injured at that point from the bouncer forcing my arm behind my back, but I just went back to my hotel and went to work in the morning. Today I found out that a bone In my shoulder is fractured, forcing me to be off work for at least 4 weeks. I filed a police report upon return to my hotel, but I'm pretty sure they just blew me off. Do I have any grounds to sue the bar or bouncer for lost wages caused from this injury? My concern is that because I was drinking they will just blow it off, and I do not know if there were any cameras in the bar or witnesses willing to vouch for me.",

It'll help you a ton later.\n\n&gt;Do I have any grounds to sue the bar or bouncer for lost wages caused from this injury?\n\nMaybe. Personal injury law is very case-dependent. You should contact a personal injury lawyer in Chicago, and then chat with a few others to find the one you want to work with. Nearly all will represent you on a contingency basis - you won't owe anything upfront; they take their fee from the judgment/settlement.",

    "postText": "Hello, I left my car (premium brand) this morning to a body shop to get some body work done ($4000 paid out of pocket). \nIn the evening (after the shop closed hours) I received a notification to my car app saying the engine was turned on. I then tracked my car live as it was driven 30 miles away from the shop. My car was then parked at a house. I decided to go there and take pictures of my car during the night. Didn't want to confront anyone at this point. I'm confident the owner of the shop just took my car home to enjoy himself. Can I sue him for that? Is it even worth it? I have multiple screenshots of the app with the location of my car and the pictures of my car with localization data in the metadata. Would that be enough? I'm going home now and my car will stay there for the night. Thinking about how I should proceed. Thanks.",

            "comment": "You might begin with asking the mechanic what happened.  Any reasonable explanation should have been discussed with you( but I guess I\u2019d be interested in the story. \n\nYou can sue for the value of 60 miles. Even on a great car that\u2019s probably not worth the effort. You can also in many states file a complaint with a regulatory agency.",

So I think they plan to be cautious and give to me back at the end of the week liker nothing happened. But I'm sick that someone thought it would be OK to drive my car home without my permission they don't even have the cars papers, I have my kids stuff in the back and all that",

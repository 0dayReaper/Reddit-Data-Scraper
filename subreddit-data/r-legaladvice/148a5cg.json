    "postText": "My dad has a used car dealership and has been operating it for almost 7 years. He has been on time on his sales tax and always pays full amount, sometimes even more, to make sure he is good. \n\nCouple of years ago he started getting mails from Department of Revenue saying he is backed up on his sales tax and needs to pay ASAP. He disregarded the mails thinking there is nothing to worry about since he has paid his sales tax and he has proof of it plus bank statements don't lie.\n\nJust couple of months ago DOR agents set up a zoom call with my dad to discuss this matter. They threatened my dad and told him that they were gonna charge him set a warrant for his arrest and make him pay $50k plus fines, but my dad was prepared and did not budge to the threats and scare tactics. He told them that they have nothing against him and that he will gladly stand in front of the judge to explain everything. They even tried to bring an example saying something like \"oh you didn't pay for this month for example\" and my dad literally pulled the paperwork saying he already paid it, and they got embarrassed and apologized saying mistakes happen, but we're still charging you. \n\nAnyways, my dad was arrested last night on a warrant. The charge is \"Failure to remit sales tax\". We brought him home after posting bail and now wondering what to do. \n\nWe talked to a lawyer who said he can make it go away for $10k, but honestly I don't know what to do. \n\nI'm scared for him and it all feels fishy. Please any helpful advice would be appreciated if you can help. \n\nThank you for spending the time to read this.",

            "comment": "Well this is your dads decision, not yours, but that said I would encourage him to seek professional legal advice. \n\nHe has been charged with a serious crime, which even if he has all the paperwork in order isn't something he should try to fight on his own. \n\nIf you are worried about the fee then feel free to take some more consultations. That said $10k for a tax evasion case that has already proceeded to an arrest and prosecution doesn't seem unreasonable.",

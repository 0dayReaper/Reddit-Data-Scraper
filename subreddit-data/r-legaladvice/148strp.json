    "postText": "The school my wife attends just announced they are changing the requirements for their nursing program acceptance. Previously it was a point system. Points for grades, medical experience, volunteer work etc. My wife spent a year and a half getting a medical assistant degree to get work experience, then took all the prerequisites for the nursing program and obtained a 4.0. This would put her at the top of the point scale with vertically 100% chance to be accepted into the competitive program. This week they announced they are changing the way they accept students into the program. They are taking a more \u201cwholistic\u201d view of students. However I understand the need to adapt and change the time frame for putting this into effect is unfair. My wife who will be applying in 6 months now had here 3 year plan of schooling ripped out from under her. Medical experience is no longer a criteria, and gpa is no longer weighted as heavily. She basically wasted her time getting the MA degree and since she was sure she could get into the program didn\u2019t expand her class list to be able to apply to other programs with different prerec requirements. Its extremely frustrating the time and energy her, me and my family have spent supporting her for things to be changed short notice. Are they legally able to change things like this short notice affecting students already enrolled in the prerec program?! Thanks for advise!",

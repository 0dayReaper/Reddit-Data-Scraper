    "postText": "I am about to join a doctoral program in a new town and so I have been looking for housing for the next year. I was messaging with a woman who had a place I was interested in and she said I needed to send a deposit and rental application fee in order to tour the place. Both fees amounted to $350. I have proof that before I sent each payment, I would get a refund if I ended up not wanting to move in the apartment of interest. \n\nI found a better place to live and then asked her to refund me my money. She won\u2019t answer any more of my messages and $350 is a lot of money for a student like me. How should I go about getting my money back from her?\n\nI was planning on contacting the admin of every apartment rental Facebook group and telling them to block her from ever posting in the group again. But I would also like to know if there is an effective way of getting my money back. \n\nTLDR: Potential landlord won\u2019t refund me money she guaranteed would be repaid and I\u2019d like to get it back.",

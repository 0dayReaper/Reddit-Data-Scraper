    "postText": "I live in an apartment with a nice backyard, the yard shares a border with my neighbors who have two dogs with no leashes or leads, and they will come into my yard at least one every couple days, come onto my back patio, and get up against the patio sliding door before my neighbor will start yelling at them. \n\n    About a month ago, I knocked on her door and asked if she could keep her dogs in her yard. She instantly got annoyed and basically gave me a shrug and just stared at me. I went on to say that my toddler is scared of dogs (trying to give her a more sympathetic reason) and she basically blamed me for that. \n\n    I dont want to be that neighbor that calls police or animal control at the drop of a hat, but it\u2019s bothering me and my town has leash laws which she clearly isnt following. What should my next step be?",

Local PD can typically issue a citation on-site for leash law violations, but they will likely require evidence and/or witness the dogs off-leash on your property. Animal control usually responds more quickly (so they're more likely to see the dogs in your yard) and policies may vary but they ultimately could also issue citations (likely under a public nuisance ordinance) and fines for repeat offenses.",

It's not that hard.\n\nHad a neighbor that would just leave her dog out for hours to bark. After asking her twice to please not leave her dog outside unattended to bark, she didn't seem to care. So, calls to animal control started and they advised me to record the episodes. She got 2 warnings. The third time, the animal control officer called me and asked if I had security cam footage I could email to him. \n\nDid just that and he came by and issued a ticket that afternoon. All while the lady screamed at him that her neighbors were out to get her.\n\nAbout a month later, her dog tried to attack me while I was working in my driveway. She called it off when she realized what was going on and loaded it in her car. Had my dogs been out there with me (they often are under voice command or on leads), it would have been a dog fight. \n\nUpon returning, she just let her dog out of the car and it came charging at me even more aggressive than before. I'm a big guy and had a hammer and it was all I could do to keep the dog from biting me. She cussed a bunch and dragged it into her yard.\n\nGuess what? Had documented cases with animal control and my call to them resulted in the officer that had been dealing with this problem calling me and basically saying \"You have to he kidding me? Are you willing to go to court if I come write her tickets?\"\n\nYep.\n\nIcing on the cake was listening to her scream her head off that I'm an asshole and her dog is friendly while he wrote her several tickets. All while her pitbull was attacking the fence with Satan's fury trying to get to the officer. \n\nYou can only try to be nice so long before getting animal control involved. She called animal control on me in retaliation when my dogs were outside with me, under control. Same officer came by, pet my dogs, and told me to have a nice day. Then went to go have a talk with her lol. \n\nMy legal advice is animal control, because I did call the non emergency police number when I was \"attacked\" and was told they couldn't do anything unless I was bit. Animal control dispatch took care of it.",

                    "comment": "For 2 years, I lived in a small 10 unit apartment complex with a tiny 1/4 Acre shared yard behind it. I had to call animal control/non emergency police line more than once because so many neighbor's had decided the apartments' shared yard meant local dog park/toilet and would let their dogs run off leash/tear up the yard/destroy personal property/terrorize the apartment complex's residents to the point where we couldn't safely even go outside just to get into our cars or - God forbid - walk our own pets (leashed) in the yard included in our rent. Animal control had records of tons of complaints. Landlord had knocked on so many doors asking neighbors to stop, but it only lasted for a few days each time. \n\nI love dogs and own one, but I will NOT ever have her off leash/out of my control outside of my home. I can't even fathom the lengths of justification people went through over letting this crap happen. One day, I was walking my dog with my then toddler in said yard when the across the street neighbor (who was the worst offender for this) brought her 3 massive dogs around the building and just unclipped their leashes. They all chased down me, my baby, and my 12 pound mutt while she just stood clapping her hands and lightly calling for them. I had to climb a tree with a dog under one arm and my 2 year old on my back/clinging to my neck! Bitch tried to say they were just being friendly/wanted to check us out, but I recall slavering, howling, clawing, and snapping coming from the 3 dogs trying to jump up after us. She called me a bitch when I phoned the nonemergency line and literally had to drag her dogs away by their collars one at a time all the way back across the street. The police came by to witness her pulling the last one off the tree. She first lied saying she was a resident, then when I told them I worked for the landlord and could prove otherwise she claimed she had permission to have her dogs in this yard, then she changed her story to it was an accident only the dog in her hand accidentally escaped her house, then when the cop pointed out the leashes still in her hands (and not on said dog) she said I had harassed her/antagonized her dogs into chasing us up the tree while they were walking down the street out front. She was given a warning for trespassing and told to leash her dogs per town ordinance or risk animal control taking them. Lady spent the next 3 months egging my front door/stoop every time she drove by. Word spread though, and random people stopped bringing their animals to pee/poop in our backyard after that. Fun times.",

Dogs don\u2019t think like humans do. Me and you realize oh ok thats the neighbors lawn we shouldn\u2019t be going on to his property. Dogs don\u2019t understand that. By what the OP says its more of a facts that his little one is afraid of dogs not that they\u2019re violent. Perfectly good reasoning and even if they weren\u2019t actually afraid of dogs he still has a right to not want them on the property. Im just saying that there are different options other than calling animal control. Now maybe if the neighbor os truly not giving in then animal control will be last resort but you could at least give them a warning like hey Im going to call animal control unless you put up a fence to keep your dogs off my property. Its all in understanding how dogs work a truly trying to work with your neighbors. Believe me I dont think dogs can do no wrong but I do believe that people are too quick to up and call animal control on them without truly trying to work out the situation.",

I knew he was going to bite me one day. The neighbor did not believe me because he was such a nice dog in their house. They did string up a wire fence, by hand, which the dog crawled under and then they told me they had done their best to keep him in the yard. When I was afraid to walk to my own mailbox, I called animal control, who came out and put them on notice that if they saw the dog outside again, even in their own yard, they would take him. I saw the dog a couple of times after that, but that\u2019s all. The man in that house got drunk one night and called me in the middle of the night to tell me that my cat (always indoors) was in his yard, and everything that I had said about his dog, he said about my cat. Then the dog behaved toward the guy\u2019s brother, the same way he did toward me and I became believable. He came over and apologized. I told him while he was there that my cat never goes outside and he said \u201coh it\u2019s no problem. The cat doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d then they put up a privacy fence the dog could not escape from. After that, he was arrested for something else, went to jail or prison, and his girlfriend took the dogs and moved. That was my experience.",

The neighbor had a husky that would cross the creak, go through a field, and up a hill to come around our house.  It would also get into our chicken yard and kill our chickens.  It also at times would try to bother our cats,  they would get trees and it would be over..  Well my dad started going next door and complaining to neighbor,  they did nothing.  When the dog was on our property my had started shooting it in the but with a pellet gun.  The neighbor came over and threaten to call police.  My dad told him to go ahead since he had started documenting the chickens their dog was killing.  Neighbor would get into trouble for damaging agricultural business, and my dad would not.\n    Then one day the dog came up and started messing with our mother cat who had kittens at the time.  This is about a.medium at most size cat, maybe 5 pounds.  Well she just ignored it until it started barking at her.  She looked up swiped at the dogs muzzle and ended up tearing off half of the dogs nose.  It went yelping away.  Neighbor came over threatened to call police again since our 5 pounds cat beat up his 50 pound dog.  He was laughed off property..  a couple.of months later the husky, mostly healed, came back into our back yard with the new dog the neighbor had gotten, a.little wiener dog.  They both started barking when the saw our cats.  Our mother cat jumped off the porch and charged.  The husky turned tail and ran with its tail between its legs away in a yellow streek.  Well the Weiner dog thought it was tough and stood it's ground.  Now we saw this all happening my dad was alreadyy.out the door going after our car.  Which was good because our cat did a shoulder tackle onto the wiener dog and knocked it over.  Well we all know what dogs do when they realize they have lost, the roll on their backs and expose their thoughts.   That is not how cats play.  She jumped on the dog and was about to defend her home.  My dad was able to get the cat off the dog before she killed it.  And then that dog ran away with its little tail between its legs in a streak of yellow.\n\nAnd that is how ultimately my cat took care of a chicken killing dog\n\nEdit corrected car to cat in the eend",

Let them know that these dogs run up to your door, seem aggressive and unruly, and you fear for your toddlers safety. Talk with the landlord about what solutions they can offer. \n\nPerhaps fencing off your back patio area from the communal yard with a gate that allows you to still access the communal yard but have a private area. That IMO would be the best solution for all involved. \n\nIt could be the landlord had planned to do yard improvement down the line and goes ahead and accommodates you. Especially if you hold firm that this issue will potentially force you to move if not dealt with. \n\nI rented a duplex that was completely fenced in along the property line (driveway gate etc). However the communal yard between both front house and back house had no separation. I asked that my landlord add a fence/gate to separate the spaces and he gladly did so. Good luck op",

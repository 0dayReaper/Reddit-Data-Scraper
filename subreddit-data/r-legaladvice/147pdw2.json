They made a video and went viral off of it- the person is not dead. They admitted to tons of crimes, said they were paying a minor to hack reddit and much more.\n\nWhat can be done here and how can these social media channels be held responsible after making dozens of reports yet of course this person didn\u2019t violate any tos yet they harassed and sent other to harass and bully.",

This sounds like it is full of potential for legal problems but my friend is doing it anyway, I\u2019m concerned they\u2019re getting themselves into something bigger and more illegal than they realize. Thoughts? Can this come back to bite them if they\u2019re just reselling cars and ignorant of any downstream issues?",

            "comment": "The current middle-person has been blacklisted from buying cars because they're violating contracts with the automakers and/or the dealerships, or violating state auto dealership regulations, or violating export control laws.\n\nTheir problems have been described as \"blacklisting\", but they may be more significant in civil or criminal ways.\n\nYour friend, I assume, doesn't think they will experience the same consequences.   Or, they feel that maybe their career as a gray market car broker will be short and they won't care when it ends.\n\n&gt;bigger and more illegal\n\nFolks who smuggle cars often smuggle other stuff.   He could certainly find himself the little guy facing a Federal plea offer he can't refuse, and they might not be impressed by his claim of ignorance of the rest of the conspiracy.",

They personally know the person bringing them in who sold so many cars the dealer cut them off because it was against their terms for resales. They don\u2019t want to stop so they have to find a new name. \n\nEdit. Which. Writing this I recognize is a ridiculous statement that screams stay away but I need more specifics to convince them.",

They are gambling the risk of being a criminal facilitator knowingly taking part in a criminal endeavor and part of a conspiracy to commit a crime. \n\nConspiracy requires knowledge and participation in planning. Your friend fits both criteria.\n\nYour friend, if he gets involved any further and actually takes any action, takes a serious risk of being charged with conspiracy to commit (X crime), possibly plural. As it is, he already has potentially done enough to be hit with a conspiracy charge if he were to be arrested. \n\nAnd this is smuggling related and international exports. That means this has a higher chancing of shooting straight to the big house AKA Federal District Court and the possibility of Federal Jail/Prison.\n\nTell him to get the fuck out of this plan and dump all contact with those people.",

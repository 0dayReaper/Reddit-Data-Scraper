    "postText": "Today is my daughters birthday. And if my parents visit them and bring gifts, cards, and such, is it a problem?\nHowever, the rub is, there is a protection order against me, so I cannot contact them or see them. And I can't use a third party to contact them or anything. But if my parents, whom I'm staying with, go to visit their granddaughter on her birthday. Would that be viewed as trying to make contact if all they do is stay on the subject of their grandkids?\n\nI haven't been in contact with an attorney yet since this is still all new. I have received a notice of appearance by email from her(my wife's) attorney's office.\n\nObviously I m not going, I'm still following the order.",

If your parents want to do this they should contact your ex for permission first.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in Alabama. I\u2019m divorced from a woman who got pregnant one month into us dating. There was a few other guys I suspected, but for some dumb reason I went along with it. Fast forward 7 years and one year post divorce, I can\u2019t help but think about it. I want to get a paternity test because I feel like it\u2019s starting to color my relationship with my son. \n\nDo I need to get a lawyer before I do the test? Or wait to get one if it comes back with the news that he isn\u2019t mine. I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get bad news. He\u2019s my son of 7 years and I love him and am absolutely sick that I can\u2019t get this out of my head. But child support is no joke. It stings. \n\nIdeally, I\u2019d stay his dad and agree to pay zero child support, but instead help out when needed, rather than writing a blank check every month. I\u2019m certain that won\u2019t be the case. \n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t really help me out, especially when I tack on \u201cin Alabama\u201d to my search. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.",

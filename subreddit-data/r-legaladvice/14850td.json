    "postText": "It's a long story so I'll be detailed please let me know if this should be condensed;  \n\n\nI received a letter from the DMV over a year ago stating my license was being suspended for failing to report an accident I was supposedly involved in. At first I thought it was a scam because I have not been in an accident. I made sure to call the official DMV number and was routed to their accident department where I was given VERY little information... basically that a car rented under my name got in an accident in Portland with multiple other cars and fled the scene. I was given a date and a general location but they would not give me any information beyond this. Not a police report, not the name of the rental company.. nothing.   \n\n\nI told them it was not me and asked for guidance but they said they cant. I told them I could give them proof it couldn't have been me as I was working on an ambulance in the middle of a 48 hour shift when the accident happened. They said I would need to FAX it to look over it and decide and would not accept by email or anything else. At this point I was very frustrated and felt the system could not be so broken. I figured they were fishing for an admission of guilt on an otherwise cold case and if push comes to shove I have absolute proof it wasn't me so I let it go. I figured this would be the last I would hear about it and I wasn't going to waste my time finding a fax machine (I know obviously not smart.)  \n\n\nFastforward to some months later I was pulled over for basically a DUI check by OSP near Tygh Valley (it was 1am on the 4th of July I was doing something like 3 over the speed limit.) I was never ticketed but the trooper was very polite and advised me that the system was showing my license as suspended. He said the way it was entered in the system was confusing but didn't elaborate. I explained the situation and he let me go without a ticket and suggested I go to the DOJ.  \n\n\nI called the DMV again multiple times and even attempted faxing my proof (which I may have messed up but I don't have proof of my attempt... I know not smart) to them and none of this worked. If you are wondering why I am so disorganized and why my post is so long winded; I have a disability (huntington's) but my disability application is processing. Currently I don't work, I have no income and I stay at home raising my child with the support of my SO.  \n\\----------------------------------------  \n\n\nSo fastforward again I was stopped by a city officer for rolling a stop sign at of course at 10pm in Hood River, OR. at a very low traffic intersection with no one in sight but the cop who I didn't see hiding in the dark. I (very nicely, as a former medic I am used to talking to cops) warned the officer that my license might come up suspended and attempted to explain the situation hoping to prevent a ticket but I ended up being charged with DWS as well as failing to stop. \n\nThe next day I tried again (with the help of my partner) and by some miracle the DMV ACCEPTED MY PROOF VIA EMAIL! My license was no longer suspended and a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder.   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nNow I figured I should be able to explain this to the judge get it cleared easily and do a no contest for rolling the stop and hopefully get a reduced fine and be on my way. I went to the courthouse and asked to explain to the judge and brought my DMV letter as well as proof of the days I was working with a letter from my boss and my eligible license status. The clerk said this could not be done and I unfortunately had plans on the court date and asked if it could be postponed (It wasn't some emergency I could have made the court date if I would have known it would become an issue.) They agreed to postpone it and gave me a date and time.  \n\n\nA week later I received a letter saying that I missed my court date and needed to pay the ticket. I went back into the courthouse explained it again and they said okay just show up to court on the date I was given.  \n\n\nSo on the day of court I again brought my paperwork and tried explaining my situation to the judge before giving a plea. The judge said they could not give me any advice and that they would not be able to look at my papers or clear the DWS charge as it would not be fair to the officer (??) and my extreme anxiety took over and I just said not guilty but no contest to the fail to stop charge. He said something like 'we'll just deal with the other charge then' which I don't understand since now both charges are listed in the court letter and I did not say not guilty to the no stop charge.  \n\n\nSo anyway my court date is tomorrow and on top of seeking general advice wondering a few things:  \n\n\n1. The paperwork the court gave me to sign said something like a fine reduction would not be possible if I pled no contest. Will that be the case for my fail to stop charge? Is it okay that this is being coupled with the DWS charge when I said no contest?  \n\n2. Is there some kind of double jeopardy effect in this case? I was cleared by the DMV and I have proof. If the DMV clears me and the City of Hood River charges me isn't that in effect being charged with a crime for which I have been acquitted?   \nMaybe this is reaching but it is very frustrating to me that I have been so stressed out by this for so long when I am nothing but a victim. I had my identity stolen and the person who did it is walking free of issues while I am assumed guilty of their crime I did not commit. having my license suspended IS a punishment for that and now punished EVEN MORE because I continued driving because we live in such a car centric society? It feels like a set up and there is nothing to stop it from happening to anybody. The DMV has a weird amount of unchecked power to cause harm and it is wrong and nobody seems to care.  \n\n3. My mental disorder is creating some subtle communication issues that are not obvious to those involved in these decisions. Is this something that is helpful to point out or should I remain quiet since I am not 'officially' disabled.   \n   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nSorry for being longwinded and thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Court and DMV are two completely different systems and they do not communicate with each other.  If the DMV suspended your license and the police ticketed you for DWS, even if the DMV later clears the suspension that does not make the court case that arose from the DWS ticket go away.\n\nThe criminal system looks at it this way:  Your license was factually suspended when you got the DWS.  What the law requires you to do when you're notified your license is suspended is to *not drive at all, period* until your license is unsuspended.  Even if the DMV says \"whoops our bad you never should have been suspended\", a judge is still going to see that you disregarded, ignored or forgot that your license was suspended.\n\nThe DMV can do DMV things and the judge can do judge things.  The DMV accepting your proof does not mean that a judge has to accept it, because they're two separate things.\n\n1) I don't know how this will affect your other charge.  It sounds like earlier the judge wasn't sure what you wanted to do so he entered a not guilty plea for you and held that issue over until this case's court date. That's not uncommon.\n\n2) It's not double jeopardy.  The DMV didn't/can't dismiss your DWS charge, just like a judge couldn't have ordered the DMV to unsuspend your license. It's great when they agree, but they don't always do that. DMVs frequently suspend people for charges a judge has dismissed.  It sucks, and no one likes it, but it's not a due process violation or double jeopardy.\n\n3) I don't know how to answer this one other than... you should talk to a lawyer.  Part of the issue you've been having is pretty common:  What the law is doing here isn't clear to you, but no one in the system can tell you what to do or sort it all out for you.  When someone decides to represent themselves without a lawyer, this is the situation they often find themselves in.  I have a passing concern that if you've been aggressive or argumentative with the judge prior to tomorrow, they may see your mentioning your MH issue as an attempt to avoid accountability.  That makes judges angry sometimes.\n\nI know it sucks to hear, but there is an accountability issue here:  You were notified your license was suspended and you drove anyway. It's a common thing to do and I'm not saying it makes you a bad person.  Just file it away for future.  Never assume any legal issue is just going to go away.  Both DMV and court personnel believe that once you know there's a thing, it's your obligation -- and not theirs -- to make sure the thing gets taken care of.",

Failing to take care of these types of responsibilities appropriately is one reason I am applying for disability in the first place and it's been a very difficult process.\n\nCould it be plausible I didn't know my license was suspended? I did attempt to look it up online and nothing came up. My drivers license is in Washington and not in Oregon and even to get proof of eligibility the person at the DMV had to generate an ID for me (I'm not sure why.) I was only made aware of the suspension based on what I was told by the trooper but it sounded like the record may have been incomplete from the way he talked. \n\nI am sadly not in a position to be talking to a lawyer as we are already on a shoestring budget and that's one reason why this potential fine is causing me so much anxiety. \n\nI understand why you would assume I may have been aggressive/argumentative but I (at least not knowingly) wasn't. I know nothing good comes out of arguing with a judge. I was only attempting to explain my situation and I think my communication issues are mainly due to low volume/mumbling and confusing wording/phrasing although I am working on it.",

                            "comment": "You mentioned that you received a letter from the DMV about the suspension.  At any rate, when the nice trooper told you about it, you were notified at that point.  The court is concerned with \"notice\" more than \"knowledge\".  That is, if you were notified but were confused about whether it was true or not, that's \"notice\" even if it wouldn't be \"knowledge\". You would not want to affirmatively represent that you had no notice unless that's true.\n\nIs tomorrow your first appearance or is it an actual hearing/trial? There may be a public defender available that you can have a talk with, or may be some other legal aid.  A judge may find that you qualify for an appointed attorney, but how low your income/assets have to be for that varies.  In some states, genuine indigence is the threshold.\n\nIt's good that you weren't aggressive, and I was giving you the benefit of the doubt because I know how frustrating it can be.  And I can tell you I know from anxiety.  I've had complete shutdowns from it (and to an extent, all of 2020 was pretty much a shutdown for me that I'm still recovering from).\n\nIt's possible that the prosecutor or officer / other side may be willing to reduce the charges. When asked for a plea, you can ask them to make an offer.  If you've cleared up all of the barriers and are now licensed (and if you have a car, it's registered and insured) they may be willing to reduce it to \"license not in possession\", which is an infraction in most states, with a smaller fine.  I know how you feel about the unfairness of this all, but what prosecutors and judges respond to is contrition (even if it's a little forced).",

I had court this morning and the judge dismissed the case via the officer.  \n\n\n I basically just pointed out that this was an issue that started with me being a victim and that has continued to snowball causing me stress and anxiety. That while there is evidence my license was suspended if the court chooses to charge me it will only be furthering this snowballing effect while the criminal that put me in this situation walks free.   \n\n\nI showed evidence that my license was not suspended essentially as soon as the day after stop and that I had made multiple good faith efforts to address the suspension (even before the suspension was put in place) but was stuck in a cycle of ineffective bureaucracy.  I also pointed out that due to the car centric nature of our society to cease driving for years would not only negatively effect me but also my partner and my child.",

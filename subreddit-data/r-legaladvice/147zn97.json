    "postText": "Hi, I hope this is an appropriate place for this question. If not, apologies.\n\nA couple years ago I was in a brief and upsetting relationship with a man who was sexually violent. I cut all contact after having the stark realization that his actions were deliberate and and he enjoyed them. I swore if I ever saw that he had been brought up on charges I would contact the authorities to add my voice to the victims. Well, I found out that a few months ago He had been charged with 1st degree rape. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how to proceed. My first inclination is to call the city PD where he was arrested but I\u2019m wondering what would come from that in a legal sense? Would it be useful to a court case? Would it just muddy the waters? Is there a better route to take other than contacting the PD? \n\nI\u2019m being a bit vague here for the sake of time but I\u2019m not afraid to answer specific questions. I thought for a long time over whether I should have done SOMETHING after my experience but decided against it. Can anyone give me some advice?",

            "comment": "&gt;Would it be useful to a court case?\n\nOnly in a very limited way.\n\nIn general, your past experience has no value as evidence:   you cannot say what he did, or did not do, to the victim in the currently charged case.\n\nSometimes, testimony about uncharged conduct can be used to show a tendency or pattern of conduct, or a \"common design or plan\".   A good example of this with regard to sexual assault was the rape trial in New York of movie producer Harvey Weinstein:   several women he allegedly assaulted were allowed to testify about their experiences.  He was never charged with assaulting those witnesses. \n\nThe worst the police can say is \"thank you, we'll be in touch if we need your help\".\n\n&gt;Is there a better route to take other than contacting the PD?\n\nNo.   You should especially not consider making public accusations, including on social media, that you are unwilling to make in court or to police.    Statements to police cannot be the basis of a defamation lawsuit:  the same statements made on Facebook could.",

    "postText": "This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.\n\nWe had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.\n\nSo we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. \n\nWe then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.\n\nOnce again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. \n\nAnother meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.\n\nThen, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.\"\n\nWe have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&amp;J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"it was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.\n\nWe've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.",

            "comment": "I grew up with a tree nut allergy, so my parents had to deal with the same issues you're facing now. It's great that you're so proactive in teaching your son to stand up for himself -- my mom did that for me, and it's a skill that comes in handy!\n\nSadly, people can be really stupid about allergies, and it puts kids at risk. Lots of parents and teachers would tempt me to ignore my mom's rules and eat the class treats. Thank god I said no, because more than once those treats contained nuts. It's a heavy burden to put on a 6 year old, and your principal is way out of line blaming your son for these reactions.\n\nYou say your son's allergy isn't severe, but any allergy that *could* be life threatening *is* severe... and the school should be taking it seriously. IMO they're violating your son's rights and the ADA by giving him peanut-contaminated food. But the reality is that it's difficult to prove ADA complaints, or even get them resolved (I've tried). \n\nHere's what I would recommend:\n\n1. Buy a novelty lunchbox and fill it with special treats for your son. Bring it to school and **insist** that they put it in the classroom. At snack time, he gets those snacks, and nothing else. (I was obsessed with the Lion King, so we had a 3D Simba lunchbox that was, frankly, very rad.)   \n\n2. Tell your son to stop accepting food from the teacher(s), full stop. He can only have food at lunchtime or from his      special lunchbox. If the school complains, remind them that they've  already caused an allergic reaction **three times** and you need to protect your son.   \n\n3. Can he read? Start teaching him to read ingredients labels, and to recognize the word \"PEANUTS\". There are lots of big words in ingredients labels, but the allergens are usually listed in bold and repeated at the bottom. Make it second nature to check all his food -- this has saved me more than once as an adult.   \n\n4. In case you don't already know, F.A.R.E. has been the #1 resource on food allergies for literally decades: [https://www.foodallergy.org/](https://www.foodallergy.org/)They might have some more ideas.   \n\n5. MOST IMPORTANT: Are there Epi-Pens at school? Where are they kept, and do teachers know where they're kept? Can teachers name the signs of a dangerous reaction? Will the school administer Epi-Pens in an emergency? My biggest fear here isn't that they'll give your son peanuts again... it's that they'll give him peanuts and then *ignore a life-threatening reaction*. If they're clueless enough to keep giving your son peanut butter crackers, what will they do if he goes into anaphylactic shock? \n\nYou're right, the school has an obligation to protect your son and they're failing him. This needs to go to the school board, the superintendent, and whoever else holds power over the school. Trust your instincts: this feels like a big deal *because it is!* Don't wait for them to make him sick a fourth time.\n\nGood luck!",

They need to realize they are hurting him and you won\u2019t stand for it anymore. Once is an accident, twice is still forgivable, three or more times is stupidity on the teacher\u2019s part. Both of my son\u2019s schools are nut free (not just peanut) and there are signs that go on the outside of the classroom when they have a child that has a nut allergy to triple warm that no nuts would be served there. Also send an allergy sheet (check Pinterest) that can be kept with the snacks. Because of their unwillingness to take the allergy seriously I\u2019d laminate it so it doesn\u2019t get damaged.",

In fact, the first instance of it was when I sent him with pistachios (he wanted to try them because his friend had them) and we found out when he had an anaphylactic reaction at school.

Even so, the school has notices on the door to his class, epi pens in the nurse\u2019s office, an action plan for both the nurse and teacher, I send in separate snacks for parties (they bring their own snacks daily) and he sits at a nut free table for lunch. All of these should be standard precautions your school takes to protect him and others. And this would absolutely be a hill I would die on in regards to the school district. I would email the Superintendent with a CC to the principal. The email would state exactly what you said here and also I would add that this is the last time you have a discussion with them. You inform them if it happens again, an attorney will be retained to protect your child\u2019s health. Definitely get a 504 if you don\u2019t have one already.  If you do have one contact the 504 administrator for the district and tell them the school is in violation multiple times over. I would also consider asking for a class room switch to a more competent teacher. And definitely send in your own snack. If it is against the rules just tell them that them negligently trying to kill your kid is against the rules too. I am sure you are aware, but but allergies can progressively get worse.

They are potentially threatening your child's life, and as such, you should deal with this with equal seriousness.\n\nThat said, you should still get a 504 plan in place to put the school within range of violating Federal discrimination laws by continuing to ignore this. \n\nYou may also want to consider seeking damages related to the Hospital visit to get their insurance on their case. (and potentially the district lawyer). That will definitely give them a kick in the ass to be more careful.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments.

    "postText": "There is a business near my home that produces an annoying buzzing sound for 12+ hours per day in the summer.  It's a large, 10,000+ sq ft building and I believe the sound comes from their A/C equipment, which is located about 20 feet from the building itself.  I contacted the facilities manager to see if they could do anything about sound abatement but that's yet to yield any results, and they were generally pretty dismissive of my concern.  It's unlikely the buzzing sound produces enough decibels to register on a tester.  It's just a really annoying noise (imagine an old refrigerator with a noisy motor, or loud buzz from an electrical transformer) that prevents my family from using our yard or enjoying any time outside.\n\nDo I have any legal recourse in coercing this business to install some kind of sound abatement?   \n I'm thinking it's unlikely but thought I'd throw the question out there.  Thanks in advance for any input.",

If the sound isn't loud (and loud enough to break other noise-relates regulations), and theyre not in violation of zoning laws (ie, the operation of the business itself is a problem) you may not have any recourse.\n\nIf it's really a problem and you're up for a longer battle there are still steps you can take - contact your local politicians, meet with your neighbors about the issue, go to any neighborhood/county meetings to raise the issue, try to go further up the food chain at the business (professionally), try contacting the landlord of the property if it's a lease, etc.",

    "postText": "My Dad lives in Connecticut, USA. His current rent term began 8/1/22 and ends 7/31/23. He's had the current landlord/property manager since around September 2021. He might have had leases the previous years he was in the building with prior owners but never received a lease with the current owner until this May (last month). However, they decided to raise the rent for this term but did not notify him until he saw an automated message from them by text saying he owed them money going back to August. He finally got ahold of the accountant for the building and she sent him the lease in May and he signed it on May 16. It shows that date in the portal the building and tenants use to keep track of rent and the lease. He had just gotten access to that portal the day he signed the lease. Is it legal for them to charge him for the increase in rent owed going back before he signed the lease and was officially told of the increase just because the term listed in the lease began in August 2022? Or should he only have to pay the increase for starting when he signed in May and until the term ends in July? It looks like we don't have a fair rent commission in my town if that matters.",

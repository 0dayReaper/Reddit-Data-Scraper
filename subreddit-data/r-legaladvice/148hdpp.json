    "postText": "I stayed at a vrbo in upstate New York. During my stay, while I was out, an air conditioning unit in the attic leaked significant water through the ceiling and directly onto my computer completely ruining it. After looking at the unit, it was clear that the host knew the leak was a possibility because there was a large baking sheet set up to be a water catch that was overflowed (obviously). \n\nVrbo is telling me I have to work this out with the host and the host is telling me I have to work it out through Vrbo. Do I have any options?",

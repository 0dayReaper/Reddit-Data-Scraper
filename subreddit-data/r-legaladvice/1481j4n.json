    "postText": "Recently, I was attempting to book a flight with my Southwest LUV voucher (a voucher received when Southwest lost my luggage) but discovered that my voucher had already been used. Due to the fact that I had not shared the voucher information with anyone, I realized that my voucher information had been stolen. I called Southwest and they confirmed that someone else had used my voucher, they just wouldn\u2019t say who or when. They then told me to report it to another customer services branch who later told me that there was nothing they could do as they don\u2019t refund stolen LUV vouchers. I attempted to get more information about the situation from Southwest, including if they were continuing the investigation and if I would ever get my money back, but was told the same, \u201cwe\u2019re sorry that this happened but we don\u2019t refund stolen LUV vouchers.\u201d \n\nIs there another avenue I can go to get my money back? Would it be worth filing a police report or reporting it to any other government agency? It sounds like Southwest is doing nothing and I want to make sure at least someone is looking into this issue.\n\nThanks in advance for the help.",

They are treated like cash.  Anyone with the specific voucher information is eligible to use it.   I think you're simply out of luck where this is concerned.",

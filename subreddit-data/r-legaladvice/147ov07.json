    "postText": "We just found out that my husband's insurance has a claim on it for a car accident. We're almost 100% sure it was his ex-wife that got into a car accident with his old truck that she ended up with in the divorce. The truck has been off his policy since then so we're pretty sure it's fraud. We have proof and 6 witnesses that he didn't drive at all that day. On top of that she's been withholding the kids from visitation since it happened.\n\nWhat can we do here legally especially since she's been refusing visitation since it happened? It's obvious this is fraud and this isn't the first time his ex has tried to use her new partner to use my husband's information illegally since their divorce.",

            "comment": "I would locate the adjuster's information on your insurance company's claims website (if possible, if not,  just call the 1-800 for current claims) and you can find out what vehicle is being claimed an accident on.  If there is no policy or coverage for the truck in question, they won't get very far. It's also possible that there was an accident and the only insurance documentation the ex wife had was an old insurance card from when husband drove the truck and the person that was hit by ex wife is trying to file a claim (and will soon learn that ex-wife may have been uninsured). If you are for whatever reason still insuring the truck, then the claim wouldn't be fraud. \n\nI can't comment on the visitation issues, that's all unrelated to my insurance knowledge\n\nEdit: if your husband's info is being used illegally, you can call the police to make a report of identity theft or whatever is applicable based on the facts of the situation",

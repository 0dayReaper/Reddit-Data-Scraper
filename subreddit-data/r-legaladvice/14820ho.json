    "postText": "I'm in an ongoing property line dispute with a neighbor regarding a section of property I've previously posted on here about. TLDR, part of our adjoining fence juts onto my property approximately 2'. It wasn't an issue until said neighbor landscaped their yard and used said fence as a retaining wall. They also installed a french drain that drains their entire yard onto our patio. We had a property survey conducted which confirmed the encroachment however they now are claiming right to the property via adverse possession. They have lived in the house for approximately 2 years. I know the fence existed prior to 2016 via communication with previous owners but I don't believe it is over 18 years old. Barring proof via communication with prior owners, can they claim adverse possession like this? Would the burden of proof fall on me to prove the fence has existed for less time than that?",

Until then the owner is whoever holds the deed, meaning you.\n\nYou can call the police to have the neighbor removed from your property. You can sue the neighbor to recover damages, etc. You can tear down the fence. It\u2019s your property. \n\nConsult with a local lawyer if you want to file a case or if you\u2019re served with papers.",

The real issue is boundary by acquiesce, which generally requires a physical boundary, such as a fence line, where owners on each side have occupied up to the physical boundary, for whatever time state law requires (such as twenty years).  If the fence has been there less than the required period of time, or if the other owner (or his predecessors, which is the \u201ctacking\u201d issue) has not occupied up to the fence line, then OP wins.  Sometimes a fence is  built in a particular location for convenience (for example, to have the fence and footings entirely on OP\u2019s land), or due to topography, such as at the top or bottom of a slope, so the location of the fence is not the only factor.  There has to be occupancy by the adverse party up to the fence line.  Boundary by acquiescence is different than adverse possession, and typically does not require payment of taxes on the disputed area.  OP needs to consult an attorney.",

One of the reasons for this is the location and existence of the fence (or whatever physical boundary it may be) should be clear to new owner C, or would be clear from an accurate survey of the property.  So, new owner C takes with notice of Owner A's claims.\n\nOtherwise, if Owner B finally woke up and decided to now challenge what Owner B had accepted for 30 years, all Owner B would need to do is convey the land to another person.  After whatever period has passed for boundary by acquiescence to apply (and assuming all other elements have been satisfied), transfer of the property by Owner B  does not affect Owner A's rights, and the fence is considered the boundary between the parcels.\n\nOwner B might have liability to new owner C for the encroachment, depending on the nature of the deed, warranties and contract between Owner B and new owner C.\n\nTacking is also typically allowed in adverse possession cases.",

It's about what they can prove and what the law is, and it sounds like your neighbor has zero clue about how that works. As others have said, though, he has shown you his intentions and what argument he intends to make against you which puts you at an advantage. \n\nYou need to contact an attorney and get out in front of this BEFORE they start filing things. Go speak to one today and get that ball rolling.",

If the previous owner had an agreement that the fence was at the location it was at and both parties agreed, that isn't a hostile act. I've been a land surveyor for over 15 years, and my father before me for 30+ years, and we've never heard of an adverse possession case actually going through. Its incredibly hard to prove the hostility and for an act occurring for many years.\n\nI've heard of farmers being able to claim adverse possession by quietly posting about the case in the local newspapers, but I don't think that passes anymore. \n\nRegardless, it would've been taken to court to some degree and they'd need proof. Also, contact your local city about them dumping water onto your patio. I'm sure that would be a code violation, but I'm not 100% sure.",

(not to be confused with homeowners insurance)\n\nFor your own knowledge, I would get a copy of your Owners Policy and sit down with a highlighter and get to reading. Most policies will tell you that they do not determine ownership of a fence, and I'm doing some extreme paraphrasing here, but usually some of the first few items under Covered Risks on an Owners Policy will relate to defects by encroachment, violation or enforcement of any law, ordinance, permit (...) governmental regulation that restricts, prohibits, or otherwise alters the use, occupancy, enjoyment, dimensions, etc. of your land.   \nThe first thing I would do is file a Complaint with local Code Enforcement division, then I'd obtain my Owners Policy and contact a Real Estate Attorney and see if you can file a claim with your Title Insurance underwriter. In many jurisdictions in my home state, Code Enforcement liens attach ALL of your real property within that jurisdiction.\n\nIf it is in the budget, find an attorney that is Certified by the real estate board or whatever CO's equivalent is - there are more QUACK lawyers than you could ever imagine that think they know real estate but underwriters have to fix and account for their mistakes, endlessly.",

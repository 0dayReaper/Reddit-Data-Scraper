    "postText": "I was laying in my back yard, doing my best to cope with a recent medical diagnosis and doctor's appointment I had earlier in the day, when I suddenly see my neighbor's hands grasp onto our 8 foot fence line and she pulls herself up. She must have used a step ladder or something similar. Her head peaked halfway over our shared fenceline and she tried to get me to approach her.\n\nMy father in law, who lives with us, had recently started a fire in our firepit. She mentioned something about burning and asked me to come over, though it was difficult to hear over my dogs freaking out at the intrusion.\n\nI sorta shouted that she could talk to him as I had nothing to do with the fire and continued to lay where I was. I called the dogs to settle, which they did.\n\nMy FIL approaches to talk to her and she is complaining that we started a fire and the clothes on her clothesline were going to smell like smoke. She asked us not to start fires when her clothes (which we cannot see) are outside before then telling us that we shouldn't start them during the day at all because people are outside enjoying the fresh air.\n\nLater, she starts telling me off for my lack of courtesy, as I did not approach her to talk to her.\n\nI, having had an emotionally traumatic day, got angry and yelled back at her a couple times mentioning her invasion of our privacy and the fact that she does not know me or what I am dealing with today before I realized I needed to calm down and walked back inside. My FIL handled the rest of the conversation.\n\nSome parts of our yard are visible from some parts of her yard. Where I was laying, however, could only be seen with her using something to climb higher than the fence. This feels like a huge invasion of privacy and is something that I plan to talk with her about when I calm down a bit more.\n\nRather than peaking over our fence, she could have either knocked on our door or waited until we were in the front yard/a more public area to discuss.\n\nIn case she refuses to listen when I ask her not to climb our fence to talk with us I wanted to know if there are any legal ramifications for her behavior should she choose to continue.\n\nI would like to be armed with knowledge, just in case, so I can react appropriately.\n\nI am located in WA state, for what it's worth.\n\nThanks for any insight!\n\nEDIT: I want to apologize to anyone I offended. I'm a highly anxious person and wanted to be armed with knowledge in case of a worse case scenario so that I could document the situation and better understand any rights. Thanks to those who responded! I now understand that there is no legal issue with her climbing the fence to view our yard to complaint about what we are doing in said yard. I'll have to do some soul searching on my own time to determine if this was one of those \"irrational and lacking awareness\" circumstances my Huntington's disease is known to create.  Best to everyone and sorry again!",

            "comment": "If the fence is on your property only, she's trespassing, but your remedy there is to tell her to leave, and only if she refuses is there a reason to purpuse further remedy. If it's a shared fence, both neighbors have equal responsibility and right to repair and maintain it and thus the right to touch it. She also has the right to climb a ladder in her own backyard. It might feel like an invastion of privacy to you. It probably feels like an invasion of her nostrils to her. Welcome to the world of neighbor disputes. It isn't easy living in close quarters with people. They make noises and smells. They have emotionally traumatic days just like you do. Generally, it's not going to make matters any better in the future when your very first thought is to seek legal action.",

She'll scream into the air without reply or reaction, and perhaps tire of that eventually.\n\nIf she's crossing over the property line, tell her to stop.  If she refuses, you can call the police.  No guarantees on whether the police will take an interest in helping.\n\nIf she exhibits a pattern of this -- repeated, unwanted, harassing contact/conduct after being told to stop -- then you might have some options.  No-contact/restraining order, etc.  But I'm not sure we're close to that yet.\n\nOtherwise this seems like a run-of-the-mill neighbors-can't-or-won't-get-along scenario.  Which is to say that it's largely up to you all to figure out how to live next to each other.  The cops aren't going to force you guys to be amicable with each other.",

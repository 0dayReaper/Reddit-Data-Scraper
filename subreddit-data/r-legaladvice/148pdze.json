My asthma is chronically bad and I\u2019m unable to function properly in and out of my home. I have been an unpaid caregiver for a family member for a little over ten years (said family member is now in a long-term care facility). I have my first appointment w/ DVR coming up and I\u2019m hoping that this will help me to determine my options. \n\nI\u2019m unsure of what I am eligible for regarding benefits, if anything at all. Where should I begin this process and how should I proceed from the beginning?",

The best advice I can give is to get a lawyer who specializes in disability cases immediately and get their advice on gathering documentation and navigating the process. Also, be aware that it\u2019s pretty much routine to be repeatedly denied until you reach the point you have a hearing with an administrative law judge to review your case. A lawyer can help you to speed up getting through those early denials by filing the appeals in a timely manner.",

    "postText": "I live in Kansas and own a home within an HOA. Including myself, approximately 15% of homeowners within the HOA have the back of their property abutting a busy street. All of the homeowners have fenced-in backyards, but their actual property line extends well past their fence until it reaches a city sidewalk. Beyond the sidewalk is a 6-8' strip of grass and then the street. Our HOA governing documents require that we have a gate in our backyard fence to \"allow the owner to mow and maintain the lot on both sides of said fence\".\n\nA primary goal of the HOA is to maintain a clean and uniform appearance, meaning that a portion of everyone's HOA dues goes toward mowing, landscaping and maintaining the land that sits between the fence and the street. Recently, the HOA is exploring the use of adverse possession to take ownership of the property that sits beyond my and others' fences, claiming that they have been the sole occupiers and maintainers for this land. I have only lived in the HOA for 5 years and during this time they continuously mowed the property, cut down dead trees and planted new ones. Speaking with neighbors who have lived in the area much longer it is likely they have continuously maintained the land for 10 or even 15 years.\n\nOutside of trimming dead branches off the trees, I have not maintained the portion of my property that extends past the fence. During the winter, I and other homeowners will shovel the sidewalk behind the fence as required by city ordinances.\n\nBased on this information, does my HOA have a legal leg to stand on? What can I do to prevent them from using adverse possession to take a portion of my property?",

This issue is well beyond getting advice from randos on the internet.\n\nEdit:  you can also get your neighbors together and vote out the HOA people who want to take your propoerty, and vote yourselves in.",

            "comment": "I agree with everything that /u/Disastrous_Garlic_36 said, and want to add some extra information.\n\n[This I believe is the adverse possession statute](https://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch60/060_005_0003.html)\n\n&gt;60-503. Adverse possession. No action shall be maintained against any person for the recovery of real property who has been in open, exclusive and continuous possession of such real property, either under a claim knowingly adverse or under a belief of ownership, for a period of fifteen (15) years. This section shall not apply to any action commenced within one (1) year after the effective date of this act. \n\nThere is a key phrase in that, that will likely really help you.\n\n**knowingly adverse**\n\nYou were paying your HOA fees which included maintaining that land.  That isn't adverse, that's a paid service you paid for.\n\nBased on where in the process they are in, Lawyer up, Vote them out, or possibly just even point out the fact that they were paid to do the upkeep, so it's not adverse possession.",

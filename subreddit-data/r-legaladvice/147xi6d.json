    "postText": "I just got a ticket for passing a stopped bus in Virginia Beach and it had a summons date and a prepay option. If I pay do I need to show up to the court on the summons date? \n\nAnd if I don\u2019t and I guess that means I\u2019m presumed guilty and get 6 points on my license? \n\nI\u2019m very confused on this and if anyone has dealt with this could you please let me know what happened? Thank you in advanced.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend and I are both physical therapists. My former boss who fired my boyfriend and me over 2 years ago on the same day for writing a letter reporting sexual harassment and unfair treatment is now asking both of us for help due to their company undergoing a Medicare and Medicaid audit. My boyfriend is currently in a lawsuit with them due to the fact that you can\u2019t fire someone for reporting harassment. He and I both helped them one time with the audit after being fired, and now they are asking for help again. They are also refusing to settle the lawsuit outside of court. I\u2019m tired of having them in my life. If I agree to help them, can I ask for compensation?? Would this be considered blackmail? I just feel that my knowledge and time assisting them should be compensated\u2026 could we also ask them to settle the lawsuit outside of court if we agree to help? Or is this considered blackmail? I am asking for advice ASAP, because their lawyer called me today asking to sign papers for them tomorrow to help with their Medicaid/Medicare audit. Any advice is so appreciated?",

However, they were a very shady physical therapy company and DEFINITELY did things that Medicare/Medicaid would not approve of. I know personally that I did nothing wrong, so the audit on my patients does not concern me, so yes, I would be answering any questions concerning my patients truthfully. But yes, possibly signing the documents could potentially help them get out of the \u201chot seat\u201d. There are most likely many other employees that are being asked to do what they are Asking me to do that have done unethetical acts that Medicaid/ Medicare wouldn\u2019t appreciate. Does that make sense?",

Blackmail requires some sort of menace which is basically an overt or implied threat along with an unwarrented demand. Something like \"If you don't pay me 20 years pay in severance I will report you to Medicare for this thing I know you're doing wrong\" is blackmail. The severance is an unreasonable demand along with a threat. \"If you don't pay me x then everything will continue as it is today(I.E. me not working for you)\" is not blackmail. It's a reasonable demand to ask for compensation for work, and there is no threat... just the status quo continuing.\n\nThat said your separation is a completely separate matter and bringing it up serves no purpose. Conflating the two and hoping one will impact the other isn't going to work and is making things super complicated. So let's simplify things. What rate do you want to help with an audit of a company who retaliated against you for reporting sexual harassment? Just ask them flat out for what you want. If you want them to know that your rate is higher because they suck then feel free to vaguely mention your history. \"Based on our history my rate for this will be x$ an hour with a minimum of 40 hours paid upfront.\". Super simple and easy.",

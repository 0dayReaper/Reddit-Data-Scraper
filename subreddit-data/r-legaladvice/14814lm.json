Standard stuff. \n\nBut there is one section that is concerning. There is a Post Employment section saying I am required to give 60 days notice before quitting.\n\nThe only consequences for violating this is an extension of the 'restricted period' and that 'legal action such as a restraining order and damages could be made'\n\nMy question is, is this actually enforceable. 60 days seems crazy!",

But I wouldn't sign it unless I really needed to, or unless it goes both ways, e.g., they can't terminate you without 60-day notice, or paying 60 days, or reducing the period.",

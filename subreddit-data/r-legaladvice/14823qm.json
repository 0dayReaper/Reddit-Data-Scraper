    "postText": "Like the title says, I just got my permit but I do not own a car yet. in order to practice for the driving test I've been using my girlfriends car in parking lots. The cars insurance is under her fathers name but she is included.  \n\n\nIf I want to practice actually on the road/highway will I need to have my own insurance on the car? or will her being in the car with me be sufficient were I to be pulled over/ something happening. how does this work. \n\nit feels like a chicken and the egg situation where I need to already have a car/insurance to start practicing and take the test, but I don't see myself purchasing a car until a year after getting my license which I need to apply for my career.\n\nThank you for any insight.",

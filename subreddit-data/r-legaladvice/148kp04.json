    "postText": "Hello! I was just wondering if anyone has some advice for the situation I'm in right now. \n\nI started a job in March 2022 and in October 2022, I was fired. On the day that I got fired, Both my manager and my manager's manager specifically said that it was not my fault and I simply did not have enough experience for the position. When they hired me they knew it was my first job in this field and I only had internship experience and they still chose to hire me. Later, they realized my level of knowledge and experience was below what hey needed.  In the meeting when I was let go, the HR manager assured me that I would be able to get unemployment benefits because it was not \"my fault\" that I was let go. My manager said it was \"not my fault\" and said that I just didn't have enough experience and he would rehire me when I get more experience. This was all said in the meeting to let me go. The attendees were: me, the HR manager, my manager, and my manager's manager.\n\nThe company I worked for only has this 1 HR manage, and their HR tasks are done by a different company. This third party HR company made a mistake and said it was \"my fault\" that I was fired, which then caused me to not receive unemployment benefits. I appealed this in early February, and still nothing. I am waiting for them to schedule a hearing, but Is there anything else I can do? I've been unemployed, searching for work inside and outside of the industry I worked in, and received rejections all those months up until recently. I just got a job, but I was never paid for the months I wasn't working and looking for a job.  What can I do now?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and advice!",

You can also lean on your state rep (assemblyman, senator, etc.) to contact your state's UI appeal department and get a status.  They can be useful when dealing with a state agency.\n\nInitial UI denials are common.  As long as in the hearing you're able to demonstrate that their messaging to you at the time of termination isn't matching what they told the UI people, you should be eligible for benefits.  A lot of companies contest every single UI claim just by default because they know a lot of people never bother to appeal.  Might be the case here.",

I have confirmed that they received it, and they told me it's taking longer than usual to schedule a hearing because they have over 500,000 appeals they're going over right now in the order they came in. \n\nI think you're right about that! I'll just wait for the hearing date then. Thank you!",

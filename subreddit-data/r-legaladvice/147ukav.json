    "postText": "Edit:  Might be resolved.  My daughter called them and they basically grovelled at her to try and make up for it.   Verbally told her all June rent, deposit, and cost of items would be replaced.    I think someone higher up had a come to Jesus meeting with them over their screw-up.  Plus I'd threatened small claims court and explained while I'm not a lawyer I am a retired police officer (true) so court proceedings, testifying, and shady landlords are no mystery to me.  It was partial bluff as I only have expertise in criminal law and this is civil law stuff, else I wouldn't have asked here, but it worked.   Also I secretly recorded my contact and my daughter recorded her phone call so we have it all on record.   Idaho is a one party consent state so it was legal to record them without their knowledge.  \n\nMy daughter rented an apartment while going to college.   Her lease ends on July 15th.  She graduated college in May and landed a job in another city so she began moving out.  She wasn't sure her exact start as there were backgrounds checks to clear so she decided to keep the apartment til the end of her lease so she could keep working her prior job as long as possible.  She did though move  much of her stuff out but left some behind while also paying June's rent.    So her rent is paid in full until the end of June.  Background check cleared two weeks sooner than expected so she actually ended up starting the job May 29th and as such was not at the apartment from May 29th to June 10th. \n\nWe went back to that apartment yesterday to get the rest of her stuff and clean it and the apartment was emptied out and had obviously be cleaned.   Of course no one at the property management company answered the phone.  There was probably $1000 worth of stuff left.\n\n My daughter had to be back at work today for her new job so I stayed and was in the property management's office today.   Their story is my daughter \"abandoned\" the apartment and there was only trash left behind.  They assumed this because there apparently had been a Carbon Monoxide leak in the building so they entered and saw the apartment was partially empty.   I got them to admit that she hadn't notified them she was moving out and that rent was paid in full.  They admitted they just assumed.  They claimed they tried calling her but our phone records show no such calls\n\nHer stuff is gone.   Once they realized I wasn't on the lease they refused to talk to me anymore.    They said they will not return June's rents, her deposit since they cleaned, or reimburse her for her stuff. \n\nIt seems to me this is a clear violation but we aren't sure if small claims is the best route or how friendly the courts are to tenants or if its a case of landlords always winning. \n\nAdvice?",

            "comment": "The landlord's argument here will be that the tenant removed a substantial amount of property from the unit, which is one of the elements a landlord can point to in order to show abandonment in Idaho. Your daughter's argument, of course, will be that rent was paid so the landlord should not have assumed that.\n\nHer option is to sue for the value of the items and let a court hash it out.",

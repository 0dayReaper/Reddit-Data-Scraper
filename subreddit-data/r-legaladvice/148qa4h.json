    "postText": "I rent an apartment above a detached garage. I have two rooms downstairs adjacent to the garage, with an exterior door and lock on the inside of my apartment leading into the garage. There is nothing in my lease that says I can\u2019t use the garage, and the landlord gave a prior verbal agreement to store my stuff there for 2 years. Landlord now wants to charge rent for storage in the garage. Is this legal?",

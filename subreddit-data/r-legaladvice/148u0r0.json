    "postText": "I have been in contact with an attorney and need more money before I hire them and file for divorce officially. HOWEVER, my soon-to-be ex-husband is in prison for an 8 year sentence. The vehicles are in his name and I have been told that he is getting a copy of the registration sent to the prison so he can sign it over to someone else in the prison for protection. He expects that they can come onto our property and take the vehicle with a signed title and registration. When I met with the attorney, I was told it was marital property and would have to pay him for it. Can he sell it like that out from under me from prison?\n\nWe have two vehicles and both are in his name. Does it matter that I have been using them for work, been the sole income earner for three years and have paid the registration and insurance? Is there any way to stop him from doing this?",

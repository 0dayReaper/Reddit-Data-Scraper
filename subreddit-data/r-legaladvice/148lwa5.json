    "postText": "I scheduled an appointment with an esthetician for services at a discounted rate. I missed a follow-up appointment and, even though I rescheduled, I'm now being charged for the full rate of services on top of the no-call/no-show charge. This is occurring in Hennepin County MN, does anyone know if this is legal or can anyone point me in the direction of where I can look up laws and regulations regarding this? She does say on her website that she does this, my bad for not reading the full 3 pages of policies, but she's also not very specific on how much she charges for her services either, it's a little vague. I'm not trying to get out of paying for a missed appointment, but I think paying more than initially agreed is a bit excessive.",

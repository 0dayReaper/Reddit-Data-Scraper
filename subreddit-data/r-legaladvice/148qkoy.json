My lawyer is upset I didn\u2019t have the surgery now instead of choosing to wait for some reason. My question is: Is the lawyer entitled to any of the money for the surgery portion of my settlement? Is that way he was pushing me to have surgery now, instead of waiting after the settlement? Please let me know.",

So it's not that he's entitled to \"surgery money\".\n\n&gt; My lawyer is upset I didn\u2019t have the surgery now instead of choosing to wait for some reason\n\nWhy *are* you waiting on something that sounds like it's necessary to treat your injuries?\n\nI think your lawyer may be concerned about what might happen if the other side decides that based off you putting this surgery off too long, it's not necessary after all.  It starts to smell like fraud.",

Also a video of the incident exists as well so the other party was clearly at fault. No cause for fraud concerns really. And yes the lawyer is on contingency, so basically you\u2019re saying he is entitled to a percentage of the money regardless of what the money is for?",

You'd need to read your fee agreement with him to figure out precisely what his percentage is based off of.\n\n&gt;The injuries are clearly there and have been proven through Ct scan and mri. Really no denying that the injuries exist.\n\nSure, but they're paying for a specific procedure that, right now, you're not doing.  They don't want you to just take the 100K and walk off with it when it's meant for something specific.",

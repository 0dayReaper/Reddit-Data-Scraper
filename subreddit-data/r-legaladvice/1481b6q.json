    "postText": "I need help regarding a personal brokerage account. I previously had an individual brokerage account through a company that was charging really high fees, so I ended up opening a Vanguard account and transferring all my money there (due to way lower fees). I have no interesting investments - literally just like S&amp;P basic mutual funds, no individual stocks. About a week after I opened my account I noticed I could no longer access it on the app. I called numerous times and was told the research team was looking into it, but that no further information on my account could be provided. I\u2019m thinking maybe someone tried to hack into my account or something, but it\u2019s been increasingly frustrating not having access to my account for over a month, mainly just to confirm that my money is still there. \n\nWell, after a month, the research team finally called me and told me they\u2019ve determined that the funds are fraudulent (wtf?!)! They will not allow any access to my funds and have told me I\u2019ve committed fraud. This is literally just a large chunk of my personal savings (close to $100k in this account). There is nothing fraudulent about it, and I have no idea how they reached that conclusion. Do I call the previous company I had these funds in that they transferred from (another large, big name financial company)? Do I get a lawyer? How can they just legally take all of my money like this?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I have a question about a rental lease. My friend is currently living in Ohio and they signed a lease for an apartment. The lease is dated to begin on August 18th of this year. However, she has a family emergency (mother is ill here in Washington) and she needs to move back to Washington State. She called the apartment complex to ask about getting out of the lease. Given that there is more than a 60 notice before the lease even begins, she anticipated being able to work something out (she didn't pay a deposit, but was willing to pay 2 months rent if necessary). The complex told her that unless she finds someone to take over the lease, she cannot get out of it. \n\nWhile I do understand that a lease is a binding agreement, it seems like 60 days notice is more than sufficient to back out. Furthermore, that place will rent in less than 24 hours when put back on the market. That's how she got it in the first place. Called as soon as the place was posted and there were 4 other applicants right behind her. Is this correct? Is she unable to get out of a rental agreement/lease even though it hasn't started and there is 60 days notice? Thank you in advance.",

Since you are way before the time when you are supposed to take possession of the unit, this should be no problem at all if such a duty exists here.\n\nHowever, in Ohio, a landlord can include a clause in their leases that absolves them of this obligation. So check your lease.",

    "postText": "Today I found out via a phone call from my ex\u2019s grandfather that she crashed and totaled the car that we had co-signed on a lease together a few months ago. She filed for bankruptcy which should go through in July. The lease ends in September. Is there anything I can do other than filing bankruptcy? I was never made aware of the accident or that the car was underinsured and wouldn\u2019t be repaired",

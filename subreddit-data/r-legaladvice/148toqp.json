    "postText": "To keep things short, my neighbor (67M) is a dickhead. I have two police reports against him for following me (22F) around the neighborhood. Police said that it was bordering stalking/harassment but could only count as intimidation and they couldn\u2019t do anything for me. \n\nToday, we got a notice on our door from the water company about a bill, which is a legal problem in itself (township problems). We get home and out of his window we hear \u201cI gotta pay my water bill!\u201d. My mom shouts back \u201cDid someone say something to me?\u201d with no response. \n\nThis neighbor has given us problems because of our political differences and possibly my mom\u2019s race/my sexuality. The listed occasions are few of many. \n\nIs there anything I can do? My mom is very upset and I am very angry. The whole neighborhood hates this guy. If there\u2019s nothing legally I can do, is there any way to get him to stop?",

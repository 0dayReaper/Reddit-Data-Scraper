    "postText": "Hi, i was just wondering if it was legal to drive on vyvanse (given there\u2019s no side effects that would make driving dangerous) in Ontario? I am starting the medication in the morning and have never been on a stimulant or any other psychiatric medication. obviously i don\u2019t know how it will affect me, and will certainly not drive if it causes drowsiness/worsened judgement/poor vision or anything like that. \n\ni\u2019ve been trying to find info online and through gov websites about it but nothing is very clear. I know it\u2019s a controlled substance and stimulant use can also be considered impaired driving. the information that i got with the medication mentions nothing about driving or operating heavy machinery, and online it just said avoid driving if experiencing side effects like i already mentioned. \n\ni feel like it\u2019s a grey area? please provide any info if you can, and should i also contact my pharmacy to ask? thanks!",

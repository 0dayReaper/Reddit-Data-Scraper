    "postText": "Basically, I was lucky enough to be scrolling through my spam folder in my email when I came across a debt collector email with all of my personal information (name, address and phone number). The email was sent on June 5th. My old apartment was listed as the company seeking to collect a debt from me for $105.52. I looked up the debt collection company to verify their legitimacy and they were listed on google. I was very confused as to why I was being sent to collections because when I moved out, I received a final bill via email from the apartment complex manager the same month. The final bill listed that they owed me the majority of my security deposit back and the manager in the email said that the company who owned the complex would be sending me a check. I was then sent a check in the mail around a month later that I deposited into my bank account. All of this occurred from August to October 2021. So I searched through my emails to find the final bill again and I noticed that on the bill, they forgot to charge me for a month of utility services (around $50). \n\nI called the debt collector today and inquired about getting an itemized document of the debt owed or a validation of the debt. The representative on the phone explained that the debt was in fact for utility services and ask if I wanted to settle for half the price. He also told me he would put in a request for validation of the debt but it would take 3-5 business days. I told the representative that I would call the apartment complex and speak with them instead. I also inquired if the debt had been sold to them or if they were hired just to collect for them. The debt was not sold to them.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve called the apartment complex twice and have left messages to speak with a manager. The way the apartment complex is operated, I\u2019m sure I probably won\u2019t receive a call back. My husband mentioned showing up in person, but I live 1.5 hours away from the complex and they had terrible customer service in person also. This apartment complex does everything they can to avoid helping you. \n\nI could just pay the debt but I\u2019m also upset that I was sent to a debt collector without any notice for some else\u2019s mistake 2 years later. Any advice?",

            "comment": "If landlord or property management do what they're supposed to, undoubtedly they're going to tell you to call their collection agent.  \n\nYou'll need to request validation from this debt collector and then pay them what you actually owe.  \n\nYou could ask question about why you weren't contacted before now.  If the debt is two years old, location would determine the applicable statute of limitations.  But ultimately, unless there is a statute issue, you're going to pay what you owe.  And it sounds like they're willing to settle for some amount very close to that actual amount owed.",

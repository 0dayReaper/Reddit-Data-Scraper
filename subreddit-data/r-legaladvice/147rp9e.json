    "postText": "Hey so I want to keep this short and sweet, so here\u2019s the run down: \n\nI\u2019m 22 years old (21 at the time of the accident) and I was involved in an accident on the highway - a man was attempting to merge lanes but failed to check his blind spot and ending up hitting me. He was very honest when the police showed up on site and he took responsibility for the accident. My 2011 Honda CRZ with 100k miles was deemed a total loss and I received only 2000$ with what I believed was the gap between my loan (7180$ was the loan amount at the time) and the car\u2019s worth (Kelly blue book value is 7000$-9000$). I took the 2000$ and put it down on a new financed car and there has been no issue up until this past week. \n\nI received a call from a salvage auction \u201con behalf of MY insurance\u201d saying that they \u201ccan\u2019t find the title,\u201d and they were sending the car back to me. The auction provided no information besides that. When I received the totaled Honda CRZ, I log into my local DMV website to renew the title and come to find out that it actually has a lien. I end up checking the account with my previous lender, low and behold and amount of 7000$ owed is sitting in it, and about a year late on payments at that. I call the lender and they inform me on how the third party insurance never paid them out and assumed that the pitiful 2000$ check that was sent to me by the at fault driver\u2019s insurance was to pay off a relatively small percentage of my loan. Now here i am stuck with a new car loan and 7000$ for a car that is junk. \n\nIs there any causation for a lawsuit for insurance negligence or am I screwed? I\u2019d really appreciate any advice",

If you owed ~$7k, then $2k could have been the balance due to you after the loan was paid off. You need to contact the insurance company and figure out wtf is going on here.",

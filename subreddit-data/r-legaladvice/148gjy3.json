    "postText": "A sheriff showed up on my doorstep last night informing me that I was being sued. \n\nMy ex-husband's uncle passed away earlier last year. His wife has let the home go into foreclosure. I apparently am an heir and legatee. I had no knowledge of this. Also, I'm now divorce from the family. \n\nWhat I can think of from the knowledge I have is that the aunt and uncle didn't own the real estate tenancy by the entirety. He didn't have a will, and they had no children born to them, so the house went half to his heirs and legatees? My ex-husband and his brother would be the next of kin to them. Then myself by the previous marriage? \n\nI have an appointment schedule with an attorney, but this is just sending me. I just got divorced Wednesday so it has been a week. \n\nWhat are my options here? I am not on the loan, had no idea I had any interest in the house, I don't want interest in the house, and I never got a penny from the estate.",

Are they just a sue-happy nutcase? Again, is this an actual court document or has someone sent their cousin Billy the Sheriff just ti make trouble?\n\nDo you know what/where the real estate in question is?\n\nThe county may have a website where you can look up who is responsible for the property taxes. Make sure your name is not there. If you can't find this out, the attorney can.\n\nDo you know who was living there at the time of the uncle's death and now?\n\nDo you know the uncle's name and date of death?\n\nNAL actually I can't see how this could relate to you at all..\n\nEven if the whole house didn't go to Aunt, if Uncle died intestate, you don't come into the distribution.\n\nEven if Aunt defaulted on her mortgage, the bank seizes the asset, they don't come running to the nephew's estranged wife.\n\nMaybe Uncle did have a will, everyone has lied to you but they have transferred part of the property into your name? Why? Who knows, ppl are odd. County Recorder of Deeds or whatever its called in that county.\n\nGoing out on a bit of a limb here. Is it possible that someone has forged your name on a loan?",

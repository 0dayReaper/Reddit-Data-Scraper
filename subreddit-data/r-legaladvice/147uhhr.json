    "postText": "Hi, I bought a vehicle with open title (yes I now regret very much). It is an old motorcycle, and the seller wanted it as a project bike but didnt have time to finish working on it.\n\nThe title isn't signed, but the original name is on it, I did some research and found a phone number, called it up and talked to the wife of that person, she told me the bike was sold years ago and it isn't stolen. She said her husband (the owner on title) is deceased. \n\nThis is the first time I'm buying a vehicle and not sure what to do, can anyone help? I'm in Texas.",

            "comment": "The simplest resolution is to insist on a refund from the seller, and sue them in Justice Court if they don't agree.     They can't sell a vehicle they don't legally own.\n\nOr, you could informally obtain a release of interest from the prior owner's estate.  They might not be willing to cooperate, especially if the estate has been probated and closed.\n\nOr, you could [apply for a bonded title](https://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/bought-a-vehicle-with-no-title).   That's likely to be successful because the prior owner is deceased and nobody else will make an ownership claim on the vehicle.",

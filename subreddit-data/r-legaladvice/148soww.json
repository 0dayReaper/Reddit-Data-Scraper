    "postText": "On June 1st, I picked up the keys to my new apartment and moved two boxes full of nice clothes, a duffel bag full of shoes, and a few other items into my apartment with the intention of fully moving in later in the month. The value of the things I had moved in is probably in the ballpark of $4000. The person at the front desk told me that a cleaning crew would be coming later in the day to sweep/mop/vacuum and I said that\u2019s fine. It should have been taken care of before the lease was effective but I didn\u2019t mind. The following day I received a call from the front desk requesting my permission for the cleaning crew to enter, and I said that it was fine. This was all after my lease was effective and I had access to the apartment. Fast forward to today, June 13th. I go into my apartment to move the rest of my stuff in and everything I had moved on the 1st is missing. The apartment is currently contacting the cleaning company to ask them about it but the assumption is that it was all taken/thrown out. I believe the apartment failed to mention to the cleaners that it was an occupied unit and they trashed it out, but in my opinion there was no way they could have thought that the expensive clothing organized neatly would be left behind by a previous tenant. Any advice on how to go about this from a legal perspective? I feel dead in the water here. This is in the state of Georgia if that helps. Let me know if I can provide any more information. Thank you!",

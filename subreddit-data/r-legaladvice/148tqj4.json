Things such as..\nBeating on the privacy fence that separates our property\u2019s \nPlaying a fire alarm all hours of the night (6-7 hours at a time) \nYelling at my kids (horrible things) \nSits on top of a building waiting for us to get up and starts yelling and screaming to scare my wife and kids \nIf my dogs bark or play outside he starts beating metal together \nIf we walk to loud or kids play in the house he begins the same behavior. \nWe have contacts state police and local law enforcement \nAlong with the court system.

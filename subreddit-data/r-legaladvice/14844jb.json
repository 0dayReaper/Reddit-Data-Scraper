Is it worth flying across the country if its required? She has to quit her job now and she just graduated college and was counting on this summer income to help finance her move.",

            "comment": "How did she fall through a manhole? Was the cover not on? If so, how did she not notice an open manhole while walking on the sidewalk?\n\nUltimately, the issue is going to come down to whether the town/city knee that there was an open manhole and neglected to fix the issue. You'd have to prove they were aware of it (which might be very hard to prove). Even if you could, suing a city government is often time consuming and comes with its own sets of issues and time constraints. It's not something that is going to be cleared up in two months (it might take your daughter 2 months to find a lawyer).\n\nYour best course of action is to contact the town/city and inform them of what happened and ask for their insurance information. You can always file a claim, however, it may (and probably will) be denied, as again, you would need to prove that the town/city was aware of an open manhole on their sidewalk.",

There\u2019s only a small metal nub right under the middle edge of the cover and it allows it to pivot. But thank you for the rest of that information. I\u2019ll pass it on and she can decide if she wants to pursue.",

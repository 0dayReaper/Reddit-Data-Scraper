    "postText": "Back in January I was involved in an auto accident where I was hit by a cop. Insurance deemed my car a total loss and paid out my loan and then I went to court for my ticket from the accident. I can\u2019t remember exactly what happened but I pled guilty to a reduced charge with around a $70 fine. I thought all was settled and good until today I get a call from my insurance that the cop has involved a lawyer in her injury claim. Does this mean the cop is gearing up to sue me? Sorry if that didn\u2019t make much sense it happened a while ago so some details are a little fuzzy but I\u2019ll do my best to explain more if needed. Also I\u2019m not sure I used the correct flair because I\u2019m not even sure what type suite this would be?",

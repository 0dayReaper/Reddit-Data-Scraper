    "postText": "So a little background knowledge, my boss has been harassing me since last July, doing things like following me when I had a private call with my dr which she had no issue with before. And then standing behind me in the private place I sat in and listening to my conversation to my dr about a personal health issue. I didn\u2019t realize she was behind me until a few seconds after telling my dr about what my issue was. My boss then escorted me back to my desk and told me that was a no no, but then I see other coworkers in the office making reservations for mesquite or checking on their kids at their desk. \n\nShe also clocked me out when I was told to stay for the birthday lunches the company does after every month. It was my bday lunch and it\u2019s counted as a business meeting, so I should\u2019ve got paid for it. But she told me to grab my food and come straight back, administration and the ceo then told me no, stay here, it\u2019s your birthday lunch. Then I saw that she clocked me out. I went to hr and the ceo, they didn\u2019t do anything about my boss and gave my hour back. And told me I was the problem and I needed to apologize to her. \n\nThen, April 4 of this year, I had a work injury, my boss didn\u2019t automatically send me home. She had me finish the shift. And then refused to let me come back without a full work release without restrictions since she had no work for me. I came back today, 6/13/23, and she and hr told me that my position was terminated. There has been many other instances where I felt discriminated or harassed, such as timing my bathroom breaks, making up other rules that I have to follow but no one else in the office has to.",

If they didn't pay then you're entitled to pay when you're not relieved of duty.  You didn't list your location so breaks and meals is a separate issue.\n\n&gt;Then, April 4 of this year, I had a work injury\n\nWas this a worker's comp claim?\n\n&gt;There has been many other instances where I felt discriminated or harassed, such as timing my bathroom breaks, making up other rules that I have to follow but no one else in the office has to.\n\nCan you describe the discrimination and harassment?  How long were the restroom breaks taking?  Making up rules and selectively enforcing them with you is legal except in narrow circumstances.",

So I had a uti that day, I needed to call my dr for a couple of minutes to get my antibiotics, and it was a common thing for me to do that. I\u2019ve asked her before and she\u2019s had no issue since it only takes a couple minutes. This happened before my injury. And she was listening to me pretty much talk about what was going on with my private parts. And when I hung up with my dr, she started telling me how this was wrong and I need to clock out whenever I call. Which I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with if it applied to everyone else which it doesn\u2019t. \n\nAnd usually I have like 2-5 minute bathroom breaks maybe twice in four hours if I drink a lot of water. Usually just once. \n\nAnd the workers comp claim was bc she had me working a different job lifting boxes that day and she never liked to replace the old worn out boxes and they broke and collapsed easily. A tower fell on my back bc she had them stacked. And after that fact, she got rid of all of the boxes and replaced them with new ones.",

In this case it's legal.  It's just favoritism which is common.\n\n&gt;And usually I have like 2-5 minute bathroom breaks maybe twice in four hours if I drink a lot of water. Usually just once.\n\nCould be an OSHA thing with giving you grief over bathroom breaks, but it's not really actionable in the sense of job protection in this case.\n\nYou haven't described any kind of unlawful harassment or unlawful discrimination.  It just sounds like you and your boss don't get along.\n\nFile for UI and find another job.",

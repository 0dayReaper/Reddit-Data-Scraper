    "postText": "I worked for a startup for 5 years, and recently left. However, I was not able to exercise any stock options because access to my work email was revoked. The company kept telling me not to worry, the stock options expiration would be extended, they were busy, will fix it soon. At the end of the day, I was left unable to exercise my options before they expired.\n\nDo I need an employment lawyer, a securities lawyer, or something else entirely? Looking for advice on what to google. This is all in California.",

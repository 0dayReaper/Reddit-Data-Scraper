    "postText": "My girlfriend works at a local pizza place in town and has done so for about a year and a half. At said pizza place, the 4 ovens are powered by gas, and has said things in the past about a poor exhaust system in it. She recently told me that the boss there put in a small device on the wall to test the carbon monoxide level. After about four days of it reading over THREE times the safe limit to breathe - he took it down. Out of all the employees there, two of them are currently pregnant and one other is nursing, and i\u2019ve heard carbon monoxide poisoning can cause really really bad birth defects. Multiple employees also report headaches, along with feeling fine prior to work, and then suddenly not. Along with this, the boss overworked both my girlfriend and another employee to the point where they both devolved carpal tunnel - and i got fired from there about a year ago without reason. He\u2019s an all around piece of work, but is unfortunately very close with the health inspector lady so there\u2019s little to say to convince them anything other than their narrative . Is there anything she/her coworkers may be able to do against him? Thank you! \n(Washington state, US)\n\nEDIT: wanted to add that they recently got their freezers tested, which read 40\u00b0 - 8\u00b0 higher than what\u2019s safe. their pepperoni regularly gets moldy and they are told to pick around it. i wouldn\u2019t hate for the business to shut down tbh, just waiting til my gf can find somewhere else to work.",

Let them know your concerns and they likely will send someone out if not the fire department to do the testing. At that point either the business will be asked to correct the issues or if it\u2019s a building issue (ie bad ventilation) the landlord will need to correct it or be fined. \n\nAdditionally I would ask that the health department does a review. It will cost the business nothing (when all is said and done) to keep their machines at proper temperature (given they are already losing products to spoiling as there is only so much you can \u201cpick around things\u201d)\n\nUnfortunately you are at a decision point where I think you need to be ok if the pizza place closes down permanently. For the safety of its employees and customers you really don\u2019t have a choice though since it\u2019s a public safety hazard. CM that high is dangerous for all involved and unsafe food handling can not only get people sick but cause significant harm particularly to people who are more immunocompromised, young, old or are pregnant or nursing. \n\nThis is a safety hazard.",

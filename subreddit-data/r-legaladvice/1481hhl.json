    "postText": "Roughly 3/4 of the HOA at my condominium in Mobile, Alabama, would like to completely prohibit short-term rentals onsite. However, the HOA Board says that their lawyer told them that according to the \"Alabama Condominium Act,\" an HOA can completely prohibit STRs onsite only by the unanimous vote of all owners. I looked at the \"Alabama Uniform Condominium Act 2022\" ([https://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2022/title-35/chapter-8a/](https://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2022/title-35/chapter-8a/)) and I did not see such a requirement. But I am not a lawyer.\n\nAnd so my question is: does the Alabama Uniform Condominium Act require the unanimous consent of all owners in order for a Condo HOA to completely prohibit short-term rentals onsite? If so, where exactly is this requirement found?",

    "postText": "I got a ticket for speeding and the trooper wrote down almost all of my information incorrectly. Model, year, plate number, my hair color, registration, all wrong. Pretty much only my legal name is correct. Is it worth trying to get it dismissed/get a lawyer as it\u2019s my first offense or should I just pay it? I was speeding, but he caught me coming out of the passing lane coming downhill.",

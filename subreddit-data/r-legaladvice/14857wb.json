    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nFor some background, I am a recent college graduate. I lived in an apartment style complex with two roommates, one also being a recent graduate (\u201cAA\u201d), and the other being an incoming junior (\u201cJ\u201d). We all pay rent, and our names (plus one co-signer) are all on the contract. Also, as this may be relevant, we all have to pay a cleaning fee at the end of the lease in August. I am asking this on behalf of J.\n\nAA recently had friends over at our apartment. Neither I, nor J, have been at the apartment actively since late April. AA has stayed there all summer, as he has a job on campus near the apartment. AA\u2019s friend, however, without us knowing he was having them over, was drinking at our place one recent night with AA. I guess as the night went on, AA told his friend, \u201cC,\u201d that he could sleep in J\u2019s bed. C ended up puking all over the carpet, a little on the wall, and on J\u2019s bed. They didn\u2019t clean it up, I guess to \u201cprank\u201d J (seems more like hazing because he is younger). C told me, thinking it was funny. I said it was foul. J found out, as he went back to the apartment to move stuff out, and has been furious. He took the WiFi router in retaliation, saying he can have it back after AA or C cleans the mess and replaces the bed sheets with new ones. AA and C refuse to do either and have not cleaned it. I visited it myself and got pictures. It is still there. I do feel bad for J. J is furious, and we are curious, could he sue if they do not clean it and replace the sheets? It is honestly just disrespectful and immature. I think trying to sue is overkill, but I am curious if he has any basis for any small claims\u2026 Thanks.",

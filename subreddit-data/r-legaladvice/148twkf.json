    "postText": "hi all!\n\nso this is about a close friend of mine, lets call her K, and her sister, who I'll call L\n\nso K was out of the state recently going on a Bachelorette road trip. K is 19 and lives at home with her parents. K has her own car, that she bought with her own money, so it is fully in her name.\n\nher mother scheduled an oil change, and it happened to fall during the road trip, so she decided to leave her keys there so that they could take it for her.\n\nwhile she was away, without asking, her step father took L, who is 15-16, out driving (she has her temps)\n\ndoes this hold up to anything or is everything legally in the clear?\n\nnote: this is actually my friend so i may not have all the answers",

    "postText": "The judge sentenced me to 90 days home confinement. That was 9 months ago and I'm still on. When my 90 days were up I contacted home confinement and they said they didn't have anything written down. I contacted my lawyer who said the same. I know I heard from the judges mouth 90 days, so did my wife. So now I'm trying to get the transcripts of my court case to get the sentence in writing. The person who im supposed to contact for that is working from home and I cannot reach them at all. They won't answer their phone or respond to emails. What I'm I supposed to do?  And while I'm posting, how do I get my bond back? I posted it, went to court and got sentenced. I asked my public defender and he said letting them keep it is a condition to stay out of jail, although as I said, I showed up to court and got sentenced. I'm in the middle of an extremely corrupt court system and I don't know what my recourse is. I suspect that the transcripts are going to end up not existing. What do I do",

Have a copy of this document in hand then leave your home and go directly to the court house. When they violate you, you will use the document to prove your 90 day home confinement sentence is over.",

    "postText": "I wanted to post this is r/auslegal but it's private and won't let me request to join\n\nLast night I went to the cinema with my boyfriend. Before the movie, he went to the snack kiosk and saw they had vegan choc tops available (he is allergic to dairy, so vegan is the way to go). He asked whether the choc top had nuts because, as he told 2 people behind the counter,, \"nuts will kill me\". The staff member looked at a list of ingredients behind the counter (and did not show my boyfriend) and stated there were no nuts. At this point my boyfriend purchased one. It was in a plain freezer bag with absolutely no dietary information. \n5 minutes into the movie he starts having a reaction so pulls me out of the cinema theatre. Once he tells me it's a reaction I immediately go to the kiosk and ask to see the ingredient list (it's not the same worker as the one who served the bf). The ingredients list has 4 different sections for different components of the choc top and for the chocolate sauce ingredients, hazelnut is the second ingredient listed. I tell the staff that this is seriously bad as my bf is severely allergic. I immediately run to the bf to let him know. \n\nLong story short, 3 staff members end up being aware of the situation and no-one even offers to help. Bf ends up having 2 EpiPen shots, ambulance called, and ends up in hospital for 6 hours. Essentially he could have died.\n\nIs there a case here for getting our money back for expenses as well as damages (eg. He can't work this week because of carry-over effects)?",

Your question really depends on the laws in Aus. so you might be better off waiting until that sub wakes up again. Most of the rest of the world probably doesn't know what the snack-server's legal responsibility was.\n\nBut - review your BF's safety plan. You might want to go for the epi-pen and read the iungredients later.",

    "postText": "Apologies if this is the wrong thread to post this, but here's my issue. I'm trying to change my gender marker on my IDs and documents as a Kansas resident. The only ways to do so involve a Court Order or a Birth Certificate change. The catch is that I wasn't born in KS, I was born in North Carolina. To change my birth certificate from NC, I'd need a court order from KS. I've attempted to contact KS legal services for weeks now and so far haven't optained any information on HOW TO GET A COURT ORDER. \n\nI'm willing to do the paperwork and fees, but no sources or people I've spoken to have been able to explain HOW do I get a court order for gender marker change.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone ,first post here. \n\nMy girlfriend just told me that her company is going to close her position and over 19 others at the  end of October. They want to move the process to India to cut costs. Now they were told that no matter what they will be fired by the end of October and were offered around 5000 euros gross(translates to around 4 salaries besides their usual paycheck) to teach the Indians the job basically+ being eligible for another 2 bonus paychecks in April next year .She received a pretty small raise this year and I am not okay with such a small amount . There are only 5 positions to promote to and in case you are being promoted you will not have teach anymore or get fired, however the chances are pretty slim. Is it possible to be forced to instruct someone on your job even if you do not want to? I was hoping that at least she can ask for a raise  in case she accepts. I am not sure if this is the right community, sorry  if so. Is there any type of consultant that we should talk to? Thank you for reading and I hope you do not work for companies only interested in saving pennies.",

    "postText": "Posting on behalf of my boyfriend who does not have Reddit. We live in CO, not sure if that matters.\n\nMy boyfriend was in a car accident back in late January. He stopped at a stop sign, went through, and was t-boned by a driver who did not stop. It was 100% the other drivers fault. My boyfriends drives a nice white truck (2020) and it had some damage on the side panels of the truck, definitely not totaled. We contacted the other parties insurance and got his car into a shop that had good reviews. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe car is still in the shop. It has been around 6 months. Which is very surprising considering the damage was really not that severe. Every other week or so they have been calling my boyfriend saying it will be ready on Friday (they call Monday), come Friday, it isn't ready. This has happened probably 6 times in the last 6 months. Come this last week, they state it was finally ready and for him to come in and get it. He gets there and so much is wrong with the car, they even painted some parts of the white truck, black. So he says what is still wrong with it and they say they will fix it by Friday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe goes in again yesterday when the car is supposedly finally ready and gives it a very thorough look through. There are small bits of red paint splattered all over the white truck, which is likely car paint from another vehicle they were painting and being careless because he cannot get it off. There are scratches in many places all over the truck that was done by them, and where they tried to fix it with a little paint pen or something and it looks terrible. I didn't list them all, but there is a laundry list of other things that are wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is that he contacted the other parties insurance who has been covering the cost of fixing his truck and also his rental truck he has been using this whole time and told them about the issues. They stated that is it now out of their hands, it is between him and the shop now, and he needs to return the rental car since they will no longer pay for it. My question is, what does he do now? Does he take the shop to small claims? Should he call HIS insurance company (they have not been involved in the process)? This has been such a terrible and annoying process for him and I feel like the insurance company should be the one to fix this, but I really know nothing about the legal implications. Any advice or guidance would be great appreciated.",

He is planning to go today to take thorough videos of all the things wrong in case they refuse to fix it. Thank you for the advice!",

    "postText": "long story short i was in a accident. my car has pretty bad damage to it. i called insurance and they told me take it to a shop. i take it to the shop they write a quote take photos. car is moved back home as i wait for the next step. insurance than says \"your car has a high chance of being a write off (as per the pictures submitted with the claim)\" we will tow it to our storage yard. they tow it. and send me their quote.  their quote is 7000 cheaper than the quotes i got. and they are saying the value of the vehicle is 10k(!!!) more than it actually is. after i got this info i was honestly just confused as to where they got these numbers from. and why their repair quote was so low, and why they said my vehicle was worth substantially more than it is? i asked the agent i was dealing with to call me and she emailed me back saying \"no i cannot call you\" i wrote back a rather lengthy email (nothing dumb) and heard nothing back. a couple days later a manager calls me and tells me the agent has escalated it, she agreed with me that both the repairs and value  are resonable to question and was going to follow up with the appraiser (i found out after it was a digital appraisal) i have not heard anything back after that. over 3 weeks.... what is going on!?",

    "postText": "My boyfriend\u2019s sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so I called Child Protective services on her months ago. I was living up there near his family and long story short, when I drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) He forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. She and her husband sent me a video saying \u201cthis is for calling CPS, bitch.\u201d They\u2019re both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. \n\nDo I have any ground to sue or press charges? I wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before I go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. This was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. I would give everything I own just to get it back. I\u2019m living in Florida and this is all in Ohio. ",

Then visit a few art appraisers to get an appraisal first. THEN after that I would report it to the police. I am not familiar with Ohio law, but most laws around property have modifiers depending on the value of the property they destroyed. Ie, if the painting is worth $100 then its likely a misdemeanor, but if it is a $10,000 painting it would likely be a felony. ",

If you\u2019ve been contacted by a case worker, let them know. \n\nI would LOVE to have a video like this on some of my cases. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t really help YOU, but it might help their kids. \n\nEDIT: For clarity, DCS = Department of Children's Services. Same thing as CPS, which stands for Child Protective Services. Each state calls it something slightly different but it's all the same thing.\n\nAlso, this will assist in the case that the state is bringing against these parents. It indirectly may benefit you only so far as it makes their life more difficult. But I can say, as someone who represents the Department in my state, having something like this would make it much easier for me to ensure those children are not put in an unsafe or unstable home.\n\nAs far as recovering your personal damages, other people have given excellent advice in this thread involving contacting the police and hiring an attorney. I suggest you follow their advice as well. \n\n",

Civil court meant garnishment orders that were barely prioritized and people who were poor never paying. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t go that route, I\u2019m saying delay until closer to the end of statute of limitations. Our victim advocates got really good at requiring prosecutor plea deals include specific terms for restitution. Something like \u201cminimum of $200 paid monthly with the full balance of $5000 due within 24 months of plea\u201d or even requiring a minimum to be paid on the date of the plea in order to accept a plea. And if someone didn\u2019t pay in that time, a motion to revoke probation would be filed. On the flipside, if you had a 5 year probation and paid your amount in full within 24 months and had no other probation violations, we wouldn\u2019t oppose you exiting probation 3 years early.  On top of that, if you were sentenced to jail and family deposited money in your jail account, the prosecutor had a higher claim to that cash than a civil order so we could requisition that and send it to the victim. It all depends on the agency but most prosecutors have a lot of discretion if they aren\u2019t lazy and are victim focused. The real issue will be getting a value decided on for this. ",

You will have to estimate your losses based on the painting\u2019s value and likely have that estimate substantiated by an independent source. If it was sold to your family by a gallery, or had been previously independently appraised, or was specifically called out in home insurance policy, that will be a big help. To take the extreme example here, you can\u2019t simply say, _\u201cthis woman burned my totally legit Picasso! Here\u2019s a video! $2.3 million dollars please!\u201d_ because the first response back will be, _\u201cProve it. That was not a real Picasso.\u201d_\n\nAs discussed often on this sub, emotional damages are hard to come by. You might be able to get reimbursed for the cost of the therapy you needed to get over the trauma of losing the painting, for example, but simply being upset is generally not sufficient.  \n\n",

A painting's value is based on the artist and their reputation, the uniqueness of the subject matter, and the quality of the rendering. If the artist had similar works that are still around, then one might be able to establish a value based on the appraised value of that artist's other work.\n\nArt is not like a dwelling or an automobile. You can't base its value on replacement costs. You can only value it on an appraisal, and if OP only had some photos that didn't show it up close, then it would be difficult for an appraiser to assess its true value.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

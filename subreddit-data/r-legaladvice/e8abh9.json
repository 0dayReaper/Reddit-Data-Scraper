    "postText": "Throwaway because the stalker comments on pretty much every post I make on my main account. I even got flagged for karma manipulation for having a \"friend\" comment on my post. He's not my friend.\n\nAnyway, 5 years ago I was stalked for six months by a guy I knew less than a month as an actual person. We dated very briefly, I broke things off and things seemed amicable until he started showing up outside my house and demanding I be with him or else. \n\n\nHe had decided that he was a good man and he deserved a chance. He threatened that if he didn't get a chance, he'd kill me or hopefully Id kill myself.\n\nAfter 6 months of daily threats, 10+ police reports, multiple restraining order attempts, moving, getting rid of all social media, he found me and kicked my door in at midnight. I ended up shooting him, after a lot of games on his part(refusing to come to court, self imposed starvation) he was finally sentenced and went to jail for 5 years.\n\nI guess he was on parole for about 4 months after his release because I immediately started receiving messages and comments from him, he just picked right back up where he left off. I contacted the parole board and they said he was released from supervision a few days before.\n\nI have contacted the police, was approved for a restraining order but of course they haven\u2019t been able to serve it. \n\n\nThey said they can\u2019t prove the messages are from him despite him using his name, posting his pictures and literally commenting my name and talking about the shooting in comment replies. The detective is waiting for a subpoena from reddit to prove it\u2019s him. I am documenting every bit of harassment of course..but I am just...exhausted.\n\nI am so incredibly frustrated with the lack of help available and closed doors there are for people being stalked.\n\nIs there anything else I can do in the mean time?",

This guy got shot, went to jail and is still after you. \n\nYou might want to consider a lawyer to help push things along. \n\nBut as a matter of practical advice do you have any friends you made while he was in jail that he may not know about? I'd try staying with them while you get the authorities to deal with this jack-fuck. \n\nWhen you go to the police , don't say \"A person is harassing you\" use strong language, \"I am in fear for my life because a person i shot and went to jail is stalking me\"",

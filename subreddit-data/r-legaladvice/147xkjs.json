    "postText": "I sold my business to a friend and the agreement was $500 a month for roughly the next 5 and a half years. Knowing how the business goes I said that as long as we stayed in communication of what was happening I would accept less for that month and apply to the next month or have an additional month added on to the closing date. He started off paying me 500 bucks for the first few months and sometimes it would decrease without warning. I would then have to get ahold of him to communicate about what was going on. Long story short he stopped paying me and avoided my phone calls. I had to call the shop to get ahold of him. Its passed the closing date and I want to get the money that I am owed.  I called a lawyer and he advised me not to go speak with him directly. The laywer said we could try sending him a demand letter, but he could ignore it and I would be out a grand. The other option would be to take legal action and try and get a judgment against him. In the contract that we signed I have the right to ask for legal fees to be paid. I don't have that much money to even pay for the demand letter. I am not sure how to go about this situation.",

Is he earning a salary from a job that is not related to the business?\n\nWhen he originally started paying you back, did he pay you by check?",

There is not anything about it, specifically saying $500 a month. He was supposed to have paid in full last year, which is written in the contract we both signed, which averages out to about 500 a month.\n\nI do not know if he has another job or not.\n\nHe was paying by money order, not a check.",

Please do not ask for pro-bono representation, as that is offensive.\n\nAt some point before or after the court case, your attorney should ask the debtor to fill out a form that asks information about the debtor's assets and/or the name of any bank that where he has a business account and/or a personal account.  After the judgment is obtained, there should be a debt collection law/procedure in your state where a sheriff or some other law enforcement official, with court document approval, can go directly to the debtor's bank to withdraw funds directly from the account.",

The attorney might want to be paid a retainer fee upfront from you and might not be willing to wait to get paid until you collect money from the debtor.",

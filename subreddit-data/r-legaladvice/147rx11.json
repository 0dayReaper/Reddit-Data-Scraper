(where they replaced 2 tires along with my windshield wipers).\n\nI am now in a situation where I have to take my car into a shop and figure out what the problem is, then send a diagnosis and repair estimate to the claims department. \n\nAll this sounds standard, except the guy working for the claims department was indicating that based on what the estimate was, they would then determine if they were liable. I'm confused as to how they could avoid any possible liabilty on this? Any thoughts or similar expierences would be appreciated",

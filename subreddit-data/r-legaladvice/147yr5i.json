    "postText": "I posted a super long detailed post but it got flagged. Been living in an illegal apartment since March 2016. Every six months sewer would back up...May 2018 it happened multiple times a month...I had to assist in snaking and clean my whole apartment each time. \n\nOctober 2018...landlord dug up half my kitchen twice and this seemed to work. Had to throw out a couch, dresser and a bunch of clothes due to mold from the open sewer.\n\nNovember 2021 new tenants move in 2nd floor bring roaches with them...two months later Orkin comes and landlord doesn't want to pay it. \n\n\nNovember 2022 we start seeing mice and landlord has some random guy he knows come in and put some roach bait and mouse traps....I have killed over 4 dozen (mice) since then...\n\nRoaches getting worse and worse...landlord doesn't care and threatens to sell whenever I complain...\n\nI want to leave but I'm gonna have to throw out all my furniture and some electronics...\n\nI would love to get the money for that somehow...\n\nI don't have a lease and pay cash in an illegal apartment...\n\nWhat are my options legally.\n\nThank you",

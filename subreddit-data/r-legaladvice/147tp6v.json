    "postText": "Last year my wife was attacked by a student. Student had made several threats prior to attack and disturbing drawing about hurting people. She was attacked and had her head smashed into the classroom wall repeatedly, knocked unconscious and dragged around the room by her hair. After the incident the school didn\u2019t call a ambulance and let her drive home(crazy)! Fast forward to last week. Another student almost attacked her and was shouting disturbing things. My wife broke down crying and had to leave for the day. She had a ton of emotions from the previous attack (ptsd). Would it be wise to file a lawsuit? Looking for professional advice, thanks!",

If they are covered by workers comp, then you can't sue.  Workers comp statutes exist to keep employees from having to sue to get compensation for on-the-job injuries.  That's why we're asking about workers comp. \n\nFor best results, your wife likely needs to consult a local attorney.",

    "postText": "My wife started a new job, attracted by an advert of remote working with a promise that she would only be in the office 1 day per week. She still has copies of these adverts.\n\nHer employment contract states, \"Location of work is home, with irregular travel to the office required.\"\n\nHer boss has stated that this means 4 days per week in the office.\n\nThe whole reason she left her old job and moved to this one was so she could work from home more. But now she's going to be in the office EVEN MORE than her previous job was. Is there any way around this?\n\nBased in England",

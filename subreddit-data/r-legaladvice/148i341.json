    "postText": "Can I use BBC News footage in a live band concert video? This video will only be distributed between band vips via a private link, there will be no charge or money made of the video and won\u2019t be released to the public.\n\nI have no clue about any of this so any help would be great. \n\nI presume that if we wanted to eventually release the video on YouTube we would have to take out any copyrighted footage?",

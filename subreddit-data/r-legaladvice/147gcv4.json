    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nLong story short, I was involved in a car accident in February. At the accident scene, the police officer did not take down my statement and just told me to wait in my car. So, I complied that day. Unknowingly, the officer wrote a false statement report - only writing down the other party\u2019s statement. The other party is the one at fault and hit me when he was trying to make a left turn on red. Meanwhile, I was a making a permitted right turn on red. On top of that, a week later post accident, I received a $400 ticket in my mailbox sent by that officer. Thus, I hired a lawyer and come to find out the citation code that the officer made on the ticket was wrong. The judge agree and dismissed my ticket entirely. \nEssentially, right now my insurance simply put it as a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation. So,  they decided to go by the false police statement and report to determine who is at fault. Which puts the at fault accident on me. \n\nMy insurance adjuster told me that she believed in my story, but I do need to amend my police report asap. \n\nA month ago I wrote to the police officer and this was his response \u201cI have reviewed the report and the footage.\u00a0 The report can't be changed, as in what is written stays that way, however new documents and/or statements can be added.\u00a0 The reporting tool has two systems in which reports are kept. If you could write the information you wish added to the report I shall add it to both systems.\u00a0 I am including my supervisor on the email as he is/was the traffic sergeant as well.\u201d\n\n\nAnd, I went to the police station twice to follow up on the case. However, I haven't heard back from anyone and the police report remains the same. \n\nWhat should I do next? Please help. Thanks in advance. I feel at lost here.",

I got the plate number and saw the driver. When we called 911 they directed a us where to pull off and a police officer would take our statement. The Officer was great he took our statement ran the plate number as we were there. He called me over to his computer shows me a picture of the guy and I say yes that\u2019s him. He adds that to the report. Quick review I got the license plate which match me saying old gold Lexus and I Id the driver. It gets submitted to insurance the asshole driver claims he wasn\u2019t there. Now it\u2019s his word against mine?? My insurance person said I should have videoed him leaving the scene. WTF. I\u2019m driving on a highway trying not to hit other people and this schmuck wants me to pull out a phone a film a get away. Sadly the other driver\u2019s insurance denied the claim. Apparently me and my wife were having the same dream. \n\nSo the moral of the story is dash cam and don\u2019t use Jake\u2019s place of business for auto insurance.",

Straight up yellow fucking paint in a pole shaped dent and the person goes, 'I was parked overnight on a street. Someone hit me.' I'm supposed to say, 'nah, bitch.' And then the investigator looks and is supposed to call, 'uh, so, that is industrial latex paint, shaped like a pole. We won't pursue as fraud if you tell us you hit a pole and we'll mark it at-fault and move on. No harm, no foul.\"\n\nThey would close cases without even looking at the photos. I had one where the lady said the car took off after hitting her and had it towed. You could literally see the pole she hit bent in the background with blue car paint from her car in the background.\n\nThey *still* wouldn't even look at cases when their own people reported fraudulent insurance claims. (And yes, filing as parked unoccupied or hit and run when you hit stuff is fraud.) \n\nGood luck getting one to look at your disputed red light claim.\n\nChances are two conflicting statements on what color the light was will have them go, 'police statement stands. No evidence to dispute police report.' Not like scene photos or damage will show the light's color. Both claim right of way.\n\nInvestigators won't change anything over a right of way dispute involving light color unless the police report has a 3rd party witness that backs one claim or another.",

Where I'm at, when you're making a turn, you're directed to turn into the closest lane on the road you're turning into; someone turning left onto the road should end up in the left lane, and a person turning right should end up in the right lane (assuming the target road is a two lane road, and the turns are single turn lanes).  If the other driver, turning left, even with a signal ended up in the right lane, fault should be pretty easy to assign.\n\nAside from that, it sounds like the traffic cop told OP how to add stuff, they attempted to do so, and are now talking to a brick wall, though that is not 100% clear.  If that's the case looping the adjuster in to what you've sent in, and the directives given by the officer to add to the report would be a good next step, and escalate that way--let them push on PD, or if the adjuster decides to be a doorknob, go above them if you can.",

The only intersections I've seen that allow people from one side to turn and stops the other includes a fourth light specifically for left turn, because the lane that can turn left needs some sort of warning that they can no longer turn as opposing traffic will begin. So if the lights are set up the way you presume, the dangers far exceed someone coming from the other way turning right, as going straight without the precaution I just mentioned is bound to cause accidents.",

You turn when allowed.\n\nAnd the lights in my city usually take about... 10 seconds to trigger. They're not instant. I reach them all the time to make a right on red, and it triggers as I leave or not at all. Even ones I know are on-demand.\n\nIf you have a green and the other car is slowing to stop, you can make your left. There's one light near my sister's house. A major thoroughfare meets a major thoroughfare. East/ west is a busy street. If you are heading northbound you're on a big street. If you go straight through that intersection, though, you're going into a suburban neighborhood. Most turn. There are rarely cars coming from the south because it's one elementary school and a neighborhood with more than one exit. The left from the northbound bigger road onto the other major road is an unprotected left.\n\nThe southbound only triggers for cars coming up to it, or people hitting the crosswalk. The northbound road is much busier and the cars coming from the south see a red light and have to slow to stop. It gives northbound cars filtering for their left turns with other cars ahead of them a chance to see someone is actually coming out of that neighborhood.\n\nThe intersection never has accidents caused by that system. Been that way my whole life. It's a minor side road except during school hours where crossing guards are funneling mass numbers of kids and all the cars have to slow to a crawl anyways.",

And, I came here to get advice. \n\nYou are at fault, you literally admitting to running a red light. \n\nThe officer didn't bother taking your statement, the insurance company says you're at fault, and then I clearly explained how and why you're at fault. You're at fault. How many people do you need to tell you?\n\n&gt;. The driver was supposed to yield to me.\n\nNope. You had a red light and no right of way. \n\n&gt; Not judgement posts from you and others like you.

The officer took the report from the girl who hit me with zero statement from me and the girl lied in the statement (of course). They were fully able to amend the report. If you have a lawyer, they can also help with this. I'm sorry this happened to you!!",

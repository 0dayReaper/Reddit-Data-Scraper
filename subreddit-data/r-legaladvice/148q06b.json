In the C&amp;D BeReal wrote  \naccessing our systems (i.e., by exploiting our APIs or any other means) without our  \nauthorization as this is just not cool, but also, it\u2019s a violation of our User Agreement and  \nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which imposes criminal and civil liability for  \nunauthorized access or damage to a protected computer and or system;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs reverse engineering a private API actually against the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act? My site isn't abusing the API or doing anything different from the official client.",

But using their site outside the agreed and established terms is.  If you gained access to the site by accepting a EULA or terms and conditions that say you agree not to try to reverse engineer the site, and then you tried to reverse engineer the site you have a problem and you should stop.",

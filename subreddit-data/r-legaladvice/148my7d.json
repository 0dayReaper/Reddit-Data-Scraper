    "postText": "A relative wrote a check on my investment account. ($6,000) I did not watch the account closely except end of year statement so didn\u2019t notice. This was 10 years ago. I just noticed as I\u2019m transferring my account to all one brokerage. In reviewing the withdrawals I noticed a large amount was withdrawn and looked at my statement from that month and obtained a copy of the check. The writing is not mine and signature is not mine. (I have a unique signature.) Do I have any legal recourse?  Is it too late to pursue in civil court?\n\nFYI \u2026this relative was about 20 at the time and helped us do some projects around the house.  I think this is how he took some checks. There are a few other questionable checks written from that series and time frame but to other people.  I\u2019ve now locked down that account.",

There are cases where the statute of limitations may not start because the crime was never known about but the section which says \"after actual discovery by the state or the political subdivision having jurisdiction of the offense or discovery by the state or the political subdivision that should have occurred with the exercise of reasonable diligence, whichever first occurs:\" to me this reads to say the statute of limitations starts tolling when a reasonably diligent person should have noticed the crime took place, which was 10 years ago, not now. But I could be totally misinterpreting that.\n\nAs for the civil side, each type of lawsuit seems to have a different time limit - for example personal injury is only 2 years. I can't find anything specific about civil suits for theft. $6k is probably worth a consultation with a lawyer to see  if it's even worth pursuing.",

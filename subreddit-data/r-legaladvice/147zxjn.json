    "postText": "My iPhone was stolen along with the wallet attached to it which had my social security card and state ID.  \nI took an Uber from the grocery store to get snacks to work late night when my phone must've slipped out my pocket and was stuck in the Uber's vehicle. I didn't notice until I felt in my pocket only to realize it was missing. I went to FindMyiPhone and tracked it until the phones shut off midway thru the Uber's ride either via the passenger or the driver. Ive tried contacting Uber but to no avail I'm not able to with the phone number associated with the account and I'm also locked out of my email which was also linked to the same phone number. I also talked with a local Apple representative who advised me to not erase the data from my phone or else its truly theirs since it'll be recognized as a new phone. I went it to T-Mobile and unfortunately there wasn't much they could do on their end neither. I put the phone in Lost Mode and a coworker number to contact back as well as offering $600 for it be returned but days later it's all in vein. I can always get a new phone, case, ID, etc but I feel as though this goes way past property theft into the realm of my identity being incredibly at risk. Fortunately my report was approved and an officer has been assigned to aid me but Im very curious is there any other additional context I can use to help aid the police with their investigation on the matter?",

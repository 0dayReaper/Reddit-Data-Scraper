    "postText": "My landlord is in the process of selling his house. The inspectors from the buyers found a carbon monoxide leak weeks ago. He was informed, and never told me or fixed the situation. The realtor came by out of the blue, and left a carbon monoxide detector outside, but never told me why or that I was in danger. There was not one installed, per law, previously. The new buyers came through today to sign the final papers, and were appalled that it wasn't fixed. They called someone immediately to turn off the gas and another contractor to fix the situation tomorrow.\n\nI have been feeling nauseous lately and have had problems with poor memory. Slight headaches, which I normally never get. A little lightheaded, but I thought this was from the wildfires. This is a small basement apartment with poor ventilation. Plus, I had pretty much every crevice of possible ventilation covered last week due to the Canadian wildfires because I have asthma. How do I move forward here? I live in D.C.",

Its taken so long because Ive been waiting on my insurance to send me my SR22 and they still haven't received it. I just found a website where I can get my SR22 but its 700 dollars which is insane. So I'm really hoping I can just wait, So can I still apply after the 40-day temporary suspension runs out? Im in Texas btw",

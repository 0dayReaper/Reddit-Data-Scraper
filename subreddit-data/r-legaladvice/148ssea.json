    "postText": "I do contract work for a large health insurance company. My job is to help people after a hospital discharge, sort of like an advocate or navigator. I help patients get follow-up care, arrange transportation, review their medications and discharge info with them, all with a goal to reduce hospital readmissions. I also notify the PCP of the hospital discharge in case the hospital failed to do so or failed to schedule a follow-up for the patient. Patients have the right to refuse my service/help without any negative impact on their benefits/claims. \n\nI called a doctor's office today after a patient told me they didn't know when their follow-up appointment was and wanted my help. They also needed me to arrange transportation for the appointment. During the call to the PCP office I identified myself/insurance company name and why I was calling (on behalf of a patient, to report a discharge, and to obtain appt date and time for the patient) and the secretary refused to tell me the patient's appointment date and said it was a HIPAA violation to do so. \n\nI nicely told her I'd like to speak to the business manager about the matter. She told me the manager was gone and then refused to give me the manager's contact info/extension except for first name only and then told me she would have the manager call me instead.\n\nI ended up calling the patient back and we 3-way called the PCP office and they almost acted like they didn't believe the patient was really on the line, as though I had an imposter maybe. They made the patient answer several questions, including last 4 digits of SSN, and then even questioned \"did you not get the voicemail we left you with this information?\" And the patient said no, so they finally gave us his appointment date and time. The patient is very elderly and hard of hearing and definitely needed my help. I have never encountered this type of resistance in obtaining a follow-up appointment and have worked in healthcare since 2011. \n\nSo, as a person who is contractually employed by an insurance company, is it a hipaa violation for a medical office to provide me with a patient's follow-up appointment date when I'm calling on behalf of the patient as their insurance rep? My boss says no but if I'm wrong I certainly want to know so I can keep good relationships with the doctor's offices. \n\nThings I'm finding online about it seem to only address if the date is paired with additional protected health info. I only wanted to know the upcoming appointment date/time and nothing else. I was never offered to submit a consent form or anything, just flat out told no due to hipaa.",

It will be unrealistic to have every patient in my caseload sign a blanket consent at their PCP's just for me to obtain or inquire about a doctor's appointment for them. I also find it hard to believe that when a nurse from the hospital calls the PCP, they get the same runaround when trying to obtain an appointment for the patient. If this is the case, then I simply won't be scheduling or inquiring about appointments for people and they will unfortunately have to deal with it themselves. Some of them don't even have phones and my only opportunity to connect with them is while they're still inpatient and have access to a room phone. I live in a very poor rural area. But I guess I'll do as much as I can and be more appreciative of the office who do help me help the patient.",

            "comment": "In your case, it's definitely not a HIPAA issue to release that info. You're working for a healthcare provider (insurance company) coordinating care with another healthcare provider (Dr's office). That's specifically carved out as an exception to the usual need for a patient's authorization to release info (which it sounds like you had in this case anyway). \n\nIn general, it would be protected info though. I can't call the doctor's office and just ask for their appointment schedule tomorrow and have them give that to me. The problem with HIPAA is everybody's so terrified of violating it (arguably for good reason) that sometimes people are a little overzealous with guarding info.",

I understand the need to not give out \"Cindy's\" appointment info to any Joe who calls just for the heck of it. \n\nHad the secretary given me the time of day I could have verified all of the patient's info including insurance ID and anything else. I had asked for the manager's first and last name and extension number so I could have my supervisor reach out and have a professional conversation about it. When she told me she could only give me a first name of the manager I thought that seemed so paranoid of her.  Maybe she's been in trouble and now is terrified. I left my name and direct number so we will see if the manager responds. I have doubts.",

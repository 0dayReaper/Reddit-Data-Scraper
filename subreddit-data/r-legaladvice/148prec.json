    "postText": "(UK) Just looking for some insight as I've never been through the process of making a claim, hopefully this is ok to post. \n\nI was driving out of a T-junction today. The car on my right was indicating to turn left into the turning I was exiting from, I checked both directions to make sure it was clear and slowly pulled forward, however the car on the right didn't turn in and carried on straight, hitting my drivers side. My car was traveling between 5-10mph however the other driver made no attempt to brake. By the huge amount of damage on the other car and force of impact the witnesses stated that the other driver appeared to be going approximately 40-45mph in a 30mph zone. Obviously I have realised that I should have waited to ensure he was actually turning and not just assumed and considering I was turning from a minor to a major I completely understand if it is my fault. Obviously not looking to be slated but just asking for some insight.",

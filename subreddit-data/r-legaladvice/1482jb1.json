    "postText": "Please let me first express my love and appreciation for the helpful folks on this sub. \nI got arrested (in Central Oregon) a few nights ago, in front of the motel that I was staying at. \nAbout 4-6 police cars were in the process of arresting a person or two, never found out why. I was sitting on the \u201csmoking bench\u201d in the parking lot, just vaping and talking to friends. I walked up to the cops, who were just standing around and asked what was going on. They rudely asked me to go back to the area (picnic table) that I came from. I went back there and as the \u201cinvestigation\u201d seemed concluded \u201cthe perps were hauled off\u201d I went back to sit on a curb about 10 feet from the bench. I had my phone on video mode but was not pointing the camera at the officers. \nAs soon as I sat down two or three of em came up to me and said \u201cI thought I told you to go over there\u201d pointing at the bench right behind me. I expressed that I didn\u2019t think that I was doing anything illegal, they expressed that I was \u201cdividing their attention from the investigation\u201d, then I expressed that I felt that I was far enough from said \u201cinvestigation\u201d and I wasn\u2019t talking to them, taunting anyone, literally just sitting there with my phone facing the ground (I have video of this). They then told me to stand up and that it was my \u201clast chance\u201d, I stood up immediately and started to walk away when they told me to turn around and put my hands behind my back. I did so, immediately and without protest. They put me in a jail cell for over 6 hours (until I could get an old friend to pick me up).\nI feel very strongly that I should be able to dispute this case. Any advice I\u2019d very well received. I\u2019m happy to add more info but I feel like this post is already a bit too long \ud83d\ude2c. Thanks again in advanced for any legal advice. My court date is on the 23rd of this month.",

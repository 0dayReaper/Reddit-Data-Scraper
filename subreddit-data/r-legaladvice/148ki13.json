    "postText": "Are there any type of protections or a realistic chance of winning a civil suit for emotional damages in an arrangement like this by the Tenant/Employee, where there was extreme levels of emotional abuse, property destruction, financial extortion, threats, being told not to report sexual assault done by a third party, unsanitary living conditions that involved urine and feces on everything that the au pair was expected to clean frequently (but wasn't told about the conditions until after moving in, and they covered it up)?\n\nI'd also like to know which type of attorney would be in this category to represent the tenant/employee in a civil suit.\n\nEdit: Texas, US. Also eviction is taking place, and the au pair has not been given written notice, but had the information replayed to them by someone else that they want them out in 3 days.",

            "comment": "1) Au Pair is a job title, it has nothing to do with citizenship or disability status.\n\n2) Emotional damages are difficult to sue for and fairly rare. Being mean to an employee generally does not qualify regardless of how mean they were.\n\n3) The rest of the potential issues are fact specific and may or may not be actionable. You can get into more detail here if you'd like a better notion of whether anything is worth pursuing. On a rough reading, enough of this that you've described is non-actionable that I suspect not enough is there to warrant engaging a lawyer. Asking someone to leave is not an eviction for instance. \n\nI am not a lawyer and I'm not your lawyer",

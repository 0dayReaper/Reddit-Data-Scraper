It seems to me they were arresting me and this was not a traffic stop so a search on my vehicle would  be unlawful correct? Is this indeed the case? And can I file the motion that charges be dropped regarding any evidence found in my vehicle on account of an unlawful search of my vehicle?",

If they had probable cause the vehicle contained contraband, a search would also be legal. There are many cases where a search would be 100% legal.\n\nWhat were you arrested for? You need a lawyer no matter what.",

A search incident to arrest can extend to your vehicle in certain circumstances. And if they had reason to impound the vehicle they have to conduct an inventory search of the vehicle.\n\n&gt;And can I file the motion that charges be dropped regarding any evidence found in my vehicle on account of an unlawful search of my vehicle?\n\nNo one knows because you haven't provided *any* information. Why do you think the stop was unlawful? Why do you think the search was unlawful?",

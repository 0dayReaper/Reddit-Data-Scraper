What I want to know is. 1) what do I do now. 2) who do I go after for the loss of my vehicle. 3) Is it even worth trying to make a claim.",

Also, if you get a restitution award, you'll have some help from the court in making her eventually pay you.\n\nWith most convictions, the defendant will eventually get some kind of probation, either instead of jail or after they get out of jail. Paying court fees and restitution is a common condition of probation, so if she blows it off it can in theory mess up her probation.\n\nIf she doesn't have any money, then you still may not get much, but you'll at least have some help in collecting what you can.",

It took about a year but I would contact an attorney in your area. For motor vehicle accidents they typically do not charge anything until the case is settled.",

Most companies will not allow you to do so after 30 days. \n\nBut if you don\u2019t have uninsured motorist protection you can file under the collision portion of your policy!! It may not cover everything medically but it will still greatly help. \n\nSorry about your car!",

    "postText": "I live on the outside of a neighborhood with a large brick wall that sets the boundaries for the community. The brick wall is my back fence. I bought this house 4 years ago. \n\nThe wall has fallen in disrepair  in some sections and need to be rebuilt. My section of the wall is doing fine but others are starting to crumble. The HOA rules state that the HOA must pay for the walls upkeep and not the individual home owners. Tree management should go along with this. There are over 300 houses in the neighborhood. \n\nAs part of the engineering study they did, the engineers recommended removing a ton of trees along the fence. This was in the budget presented to home owners at the meeting. No costs for individual owners were discussed. \n\n20 years ago the developers who build my house planted a cottonwood right next to the fence. It has since grown 60 feet and it\u2019s base touches the bottom of the wall. The engineers say this should be cut down but the contractor \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to do it for treehugger reasons.\u201dBecause of this, they are trying to pass the costs to individual owners long the brick wall. \n\nThe HOA is paying for tree removal on the outside of the wall but not any on peoples property. This seems extremely unjust to me, especially with only 2 weeks notice. \n\nThe tree provides a lot of shade to my yard and house. I like it a lot and it do not want it gone. Also I had someone come out to give me a bid and they said they couldnt even remove the stump until after the wall is torn down due to its proximity. \n\nHow should I approach my meeting with the HOA president?",

            "comment": "$1,500 to cut and stump grind a 60ft cottonwood sounds like a really good deal. But I would hate to lose that shade right when the 100F+ days are here. \n\nYou may need a permit to remove a tree that size and that may be difficult depending on your local ordinances, but here in Austin it's encouraged to remove cottonwoods especially the females for fire prevention. They're also prone to disease and root/ crown rot, and tend to drop branches in windstorms.  The roots are aggressive to pipes, foundations, sidewalks, walls, etc. \n\nHere's a pretty decent article from my local extension about cottonwoods. \n\nhttps://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=350278",

As is, OP should be having a certified arborist make a health assessment of the tree every other year to avoid damage to his house. Sucks to lose that shade here in Texas. Cottonwoods are fast growing and short lived, it may be nearing its decline anyway. All costs and benefits weighed, I'd choose to remove. Especially for $1,500!",

If OP is in far east Texas with their deep soil, their cottonwood may have many decades left and be hardy. Where I am, we sit on limestone with soil that is shallow with high pH and cottonwoods often fail abruptly. Cottonwood is also a weak wood, as are most trees with fast growth rates/ short life spans. It's all really specific and tailored depending on *where* in Texas and which tree species.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to research this, but it's like I can't find the right keywords.   This is not regarding the *hiring* of employees of a non-profit.  I am wondering if it is legal in the US to start a non-profit that seeks to help, through volunteer work or potentially financially through grants, specific groups of people (such as people of color). \n\nI assume it is, because there are lots of non-profits for certain protected groups (disabilities, for women, for veterans, and obviously there's the NAACP) but when I've tried to look into this all I can find is stuff prohibiting discrimination in employment / Title IX stuff.  I'm not trying to circumvent any of that, I just couldn't figure out if the same rules apply to benefactors of a non-profit. \n\nIf anyone can point me to the right concepts to research I'd appreciate it.",

Start volunteering at nonprofits, talk to nonprofit professionals, go to webinars that talk about how to start a nonprofit. \n\nAnd do your research and organizations in your area. If you live even in a semi decent sized city I can almost guarantee you there is an organization already doing what you want to do. If this is the work you want to do, lift up agencies who already have made the inroads- help build capacity\u2026it\u2019s already almost impossible with the resources currently available.",

I have looked high and low for organizations doing this work and found nothing similar (except a few underwhelming scholarships, but I'd be targeting post-graduate individuals).  Essentially, my NPO would provide free job training that helps people obtain a healthcare licensure sooner and potentially some guidance in starting their own businesses if they want to.  (It's not about circumventing licensure requirements, it's about eliminating an economic barrier that exists within them).   I'm sure I can figure out the starting of the non-profit, I'm just not sure about the legality of the charter.\n\nEdit : just to clarify, the actual work is some thing I am very happy and qualified and have the time to do, putting some external structure around it would offer some legitimacy and potentially lead to more people being helped. I know that starting a nonprofit is not a small venture, but I also know friends who have done it to solidify some of their personal passion projects.",

            "comment": "Maybe you should consider starting a foundation that might be able to more easily achieve the objective you want.  \n\nOne consideration with starting a non-profit that has a stated goal of \"wanting to help minorities\" is that it will inevitably attract someone who sees your stated goal and will want to challenge, protest to and object to your mission, asking why your organization does not want to offer help to non-minorities.\n\nPerhaps it would be better for you to do the work as a private individual, where you could contact minority group organizations, churches, civil rights organizations and other sources to individually ask for potential candidates who might be interested in the services you want to offer.",

Perhaps that is a crucial difference.  and yes, that is exactly the scenario I am trying to anticipate and avoid.  it is especially hard to know what the future holds as things like affirmative action are being challenged in the parents versus Harvard supreme court case.\n\nI do assume there is some legal premise by which this can be done though, otherwise the NAACP would be at risk of dissolution, no?",

The first thing I would do is ask a local reference librarian (at a public library or at a unversity library) if they have any books about how to set up a foundation.",

    "postText": "I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. \nThere is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.\n\nI know I'm angry and grieving. But because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until I had to let her go. \n\nIs there anything I can do?",

This type of contract doesn\u2019t have to be in writing, but do keep the texts. She obviously did not hold up her end of the deal\u2014do you know if she checked on them at any point while you were gone? I would advise chatting with a lawyer, as you probably predicted. Keep the veterinary bills, as well as anything you happen to have from them that lists dehydration as a substantial cause of death. A few states (I know for sure TN) will potentially let you recover compensation for \u201closs of companionship,\u201d as well. I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your cat, and that the person you trusted to take care of them let you down.",

Co-worker voluntarily assumed duty to care for cats, was negligent in their performance of the duty, which was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries, said injuries being or resulting in \u201cdamages,\u201d i.e. vet bills. I suppose you could make a contract claim under a theory of promissory estoppel, co-worker made a promise, OP relied on the promise to their detriment and it resulted in damages.",

So suing your \u201cfriend\u201d for damages is probably not going to be worthwhile. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to whether or not criminal charges are applicable here, but the fact that she never agreed in writing to watch your cats means that probably you wouldn\u2019t be able to prove your case even if criminal charges were filed. \n\nHonestly I suggest you cut this person out of your life and do your best to move on. I\u2019m really sorry about your kitty. ",

This is where I'm a little confused about your story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou say you were gone for 4 days, when did you check in on them exactly? And when did you get responses? Did you ever text her a reminder to check on them like right when you were leaving? Did she reply then? Or did you check the day before you left, the day you left, and every day until the end, and she only finally texted you back once you came home?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to defend your friend in the slightest, it sounds like she is lazy and disorganized, I'm just trying to get an actual timeline of documented conversation. It seems you've said your \"friend\" is paying for the medical bills, but you may still seek more or go after her, so I'm just wondering what all you have here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* : Thanks for replying, thread seems to be locked (as always in this sub lol). It seems like maybe she actually did come to feed them but was just completely entirely oblivious that they needed the water refilled? It's a huge shame, I feel really bad, but I wouldn't suggest going after her legally, it seems like she's unfortunately just stupid and not to be trusted, but I guess maybe you would have grounds to sue, even though I'd advice against it.

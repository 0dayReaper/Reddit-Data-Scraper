    "postText": "My mother recently went on vacation and rented a jet ski. She took a video of the jet ski prior to renting it to document its condition. She brought it back in fine condition, there was a small scratch, not even an inch big. Later she gets a call that they\u2019re going to keep the entire 500 dollar deposit to repair it. My stepfather works in boat repair, fixing a small scratch like that would take 100 dollars at most, factoring in both labor costs and cost of materials. The reviews for this service are all also about getting their deposits stolen. My mother did sign a contract, but there certainly must be some grounds to get her money back or sue?",

            "comment": "&gt; My mother did sign a contract,\n\nWhat did it specifically say about damages?  If the language requires that any damage - to which you admit, there was - results in giving up the $500, then that's exactly how it played out, which she agreed to.\n\n&gt; My stepfather works in boat repair, fixing a small scratch like that would take 100 dollars at most, factoring in both labor costs and cost of materials. \n\nRight, but there's also any time that the vehicle may be out of service, and the possibility that their repair costs more.  It's a tough spot to try to negotiate from, especially when the contract *may* have required your mother to agree to those terms and not 'agree to pay whatever amount my husband says it will cost to repair'",

I went online to see if it was there and it\u2019s not, I called them and they refused to give it to me (I didn\u2019t tell them who I was).\n\nIt\u2019s also a small town lake company. By their own admission there\u2019s about 1 rental a week with about 5 jet skis to use. There\u2019s no lost revenue by having to spend less than an hour repairing a scratch in house with materials that were visible in the building.",

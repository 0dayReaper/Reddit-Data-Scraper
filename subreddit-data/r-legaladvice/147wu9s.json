    "postText": " I sustained an injury while working as a 23-year-old female Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) during patient transfers. I would like to provide some background information on the events leading up to the incident, as it may help shed light on why I am currently facing difficulties and receiving unfavorable treatment from my employer.  \nBackground: Almost a year ago, I started working at my current job. On the day of my injury, a fellow CNA, who is known for being lazy and unfair in dividing patient loads, was assigned to the front desk. She consistently manipulated the patient assignments to her advantage, leaving the more physically demanding tasks for the other tech. Given the low staffing situation, I, trained to work at the front desk, scheduled a few shifts there. This upset the other CNA, who would pretend to be sick to switch shifts with me, despite not being trained for front desk duties. This situation escalated to the point where she would constantly ask me to switch and resort to trash-talking and making everyone aware of her unhappiness. Unfortunately, on the one day she managed to secure a front desk shift, I was assigned as a CNA, and I accepted it without complaint, leading to the day of my injury.  \nInjury Incident: Two months ago, while transferring patients, I injured my back. Throughout the day, I had repeatedly used the call button and even walked to the nurses' station to ask for assistance, but no one showed up. This lack of response was highly unusual, as in my almost year-long tenure, there had always been someone available whenever assistance was required. When I questioned the nurses about the lack of help, they informed me that they hadn't been informed or paged. The front desk's responsibility is to promptly relay calls for assistance or locate a nearby nurse. I quickly realized that the lazy CNA had been accepting my calls and intentionally not informing anyone about my need for help. Eventually, my back gave out around lunchtime, resulting in a back and neck injury.  \nActions Taken and Current Situation: Following the incident, I promptly filed a First Report of Injury and informed my boss about my repeated requests for help that went unanswered. I subsequently had an interview with the insurance representative and visited the doctor twice. I promptly completed all the necessary tasks and requirements for my workers' compensation claim within the given timeframe provided by the relevant parties.  Initially, I was informed that my workplace would cover my medical expenses related to the injury and provide financial compensation during my time off work. However, upon receiving my first bill and noticing the lack of payment, I decided to delay the recommended scan until I received confirmation that my employer would cover it. ( I don't have health insurance in the state of Montana so if they refused to pay for it I would be paying out of pocket. Technically my health insurance is KAISER in CA).   \nUpon contacting the insurance representative, I discovered that the individual at my workplace responsible for providing the relevant materials had been unresponsive to calls and emails for weeks. It is crucial to note that prior to this situation, I had been deemed fit for work at the front desk or as a sitter (monitoring high-risk individuals). However, I was restricted from performing patient transfers or activities that would strain my body. I attempted to pick up front desk shifts, which were immediately declined by my boss, who cited my \"TPD status\" as the reason. TPD status has no connection to my injury and is simply a part-time position with fewer restrictions. As a TPD employee, I am responsible for picking up my own shifts, and I am only required to work three full shifts per month. This position grants me more flexibility with my schedule and allows me to take vacations. Therefore, it is perplexing that my boss told me that the reason she denied my shifts was due to my \u201cTPD\u201d.   \nDuring my conversation with the insurance representative, I inquired about the unusual lack of response from my workplace. She expressed that she had never encountered this issue before and considered it to be highly atypical. Due to the urgency of the situation, she mentioned the possibility of denying my workers' compensation claim if she did not receive the required information promptly. However, she assured me that once she obtains the necessary details, she will accept the claim. Additionally, she requested that I email her screenshots as evidence that my employer is preventing me from working. Previously, my colleagues in similar situations were able to assume the role of a Health Unit Coordinator (HUC) while on light duty, which I am currently on.   \nHere are my questions:  \n1. Is my place of work attempting to avoid compensating me?  \n2. Is the conduct of my boss in accordance with legal standards?  \n3. Should I consider seeking legal advice?  \n4. WTH DO I DO? I have no income right now- my dad has had to send me money which is embarrassing asf. I have animals to take care of. I live paycheck to paycheck. Im fucking screwed right now.   \n\n\nFurthermore, I can't help but feel suspicious about the entire situation. Am I being overly cautious and overanalyzing everything? Or is there cause for concern regarding the appropriateness of these circumstances?  \nI want to clarify that I did not throw the lazy CNA under the bus too my boss for intentionally withholding information about my need for assistance. Instead, I informed my boss that I had made multiple calls for help, received confirmation each time that someone would come, but ultimately, no one arrived. However, I do have a suspicion that the CNA intentionally neglected to inform the staff, and I believe that her actions directly contributed to my injury.  \n",

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nThrowaway account, in TX.\n\nI signed a repayment agreement with my current company when I was relocated down here 19 months ago, it had a 24 month payback clause in the case of voluntary or for-cause termination .  The company recently announced the facility would be permanently shutting down and all jobs would be eliminated, I received a WARN letter when they announced it.\n\nMy last day was anticipated to be last month, however a few days before the announced last date I received a notice that my end date had been extended a few extra months.  There is a potential of other roles being available for me in the same metro area, but it would be a reduction in scope of the role and add a significant commute (1+hr each way  w/traffic vs. current 5 minutes).  Because of the uncertainty I have started to look for employment elsewhere, but am a bit uncertain how to approach my repayment agreement.  \n\nI understand if my role is eliminated, I will not be liable to pay back the expenses per the agreement.  However if I  continue to be extended without notice and find another good opportunity before the 24 months is up and I leave would I still be obligated to pay back the expenses?  If I choose not to apply for any open roles (despite being told I would get it) and my position is eliminated would I no longer be obligated to pay?\n\nI understand I'd need to consult a local attorney before making such a decision, but I'd first like to understand if there's any possibility that I could move on without being obligated to pay back this large sum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

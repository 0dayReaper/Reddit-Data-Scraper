    "postText": "Long story short, As I got off the freeway, I had a car either coming from a T-section or A plaza  drive into the far left lane, colliding into me and scratching my passenger side completely (including my rear view mirror that i can no longer adjust cause its stuck) and even causing my door to sound weird as I open it. We didnt call the police nor make much conversation due to a language barrier. We exchanged insurances and ID and went on about our days.\n\nWell, today, His Insurance had called me and said they were going to deny The claim I made due to different stories. The guy who collided into me claimed He was in the middle lane and I COLLIDED into him, which to me doesn\u2019t make sense cause my car was the one who got screwed over the most. (my whole passenger side including bumper is scratched while his rear view mirror just got messed up) I dont have a camera attached to my car and I didnt catch his phone number, just an ID. All i have is Pictures. Anything else I can do to make his insurance pay for it?",

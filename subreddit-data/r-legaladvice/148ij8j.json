Would it be ok to for me to start switching all my paperwork under that name now, or wait until after the name change? Would it be ok to start using it for new legally binding things now,  or after I change my name?",

You have no supporting documentation to justify making that change, and therefore no ID under that name.  Things could get messy as a result.\n\nNot sure what 'all my paperwork' means, but you'll need legal documentation for your DL, passport, etc.\n\nYou can go by whatever name you like.",

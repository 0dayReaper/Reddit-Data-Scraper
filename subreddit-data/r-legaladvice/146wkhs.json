Assuming they get dismissed simply because there is no good evidence, you may be eligible for a fee waiver. If you do it yourself then it would take time and be a hassle, but if you hire an attorney to do the expungement, it may cost a nominal amount of money (just a ballpark figure for my state, around 1k with a fee waiver, or twice that, maybe a little more, without.. per instance).\n\nI only say that because for nursing job applications you might be asked to disclose whether you have ever been arrested, even if the charges were later dismissed. Unless you have an expungement you would have to answer \u201cyes\u201d. At best, you would explain what happened and they would move on with the hiring process. At worst, they would think \u201cthis person might be a liability\u201d and not hire you.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure how the nurse licensing board is, but it\u2019s possible you will have to disclose the arrest to them as well, even if it\u2019s dismissed, and possibly even if it\u2019s expunged.",

They have very high case loads as *surprise* not a lot of people have thousands of dollars to spend on legal matters, on anything outside of regular life costs. From the date of offense the State Attorney has 90 days to formally file charges (for a misdemeanor), but normally takes around 30 days for that decision. Public Defenders have very little information about your case until the State makes their decision. They will probably be difficult to get in touch with before the State makes their decision because of this. It doesn\u2019t help them to hear your side before they know what information the State has and what outcome the State is seeking. If your case is dismissed/no information is filed you\u2019re good to go with the criminal aspect. As for the charge (granted this is FL, idk how NJ differs) because you were arrested it will stay on your record and though employers should be able to see it was dismissed they may not do that research, they may still hold that against you. Once your case is dismissed I would begin the expungement process immediately. In FL it is done through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. They have a checklist of what you need on their website. As for the wrongful arrest, that is a civil matter. You can consult a private civil attorney now but they will likely have to wait to take action until the State makes their filing decision (if the State is pursuing the charge). Where I am Public Defenders do not represent people in civil cases, only criminal cases. \n\nThe criminal justice system moves very slowly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you and I wish you the best.",

I'm also a pharmacist and that concern is really only for initially taking it, you shouldn't drive until you know how it will impact you. BUT, I see the point being made here is when you are asked if you were on anything else just say no. They are asking if you were impaired, just answer no. Don't deliver that additional information because even though we know it's bogus, it may hold up unfortunately. You weren't intoxicated nor on any other substances that could have caused intoxication, that's the end of it.",

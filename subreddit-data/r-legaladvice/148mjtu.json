    "postText": "I'm a (30F) professional nanny in the 9th year of my career. I have an excellent reputation and plenty of glowing references. I have never been fired from any job. \n\nI started with a new family 6 months ago, at which time we negotiated a contract and came up with terms we all agreed to. This included a sick care policy that said I would be off and paid if their child had certain symptoms/fever above a certain threshold, and that they would give me as much advance notice as possible if any illness in the household so I could make a judgement call. Before signing, we all made tweaks to the policy until we were all happy with it. In the months since, there were several instances of illness in the household. I was never given advance notice, and it was clear they expected me to stay and work regardless of our policy or my comfort. I was passive and never enforced the policy, to my detriment. Last Friday, baby was very sick when I arrived and I politely informed them that I would need to follow the policy this time. They said ok and I left when a family member arrived.\n\nOn Monday, they sat me down and said they weren\u2019t happy with the sick policy and wanted to change it. They also wanted to make changes to my compensation in a way that would diminish my earning potential. I told them I would consider their requests and we agreed to reconvene on Friday afternoon. However, I wound up having an overwhelming week with a family member in crisis, so on Friday morning I asked Parent 1 to postpone our meeting until Monday. Parent 1 agreed at first, then several hours later let me know that after speaking with Parent 2, they decided we would be meeting that day still. I calmly reiterated that I was not prepared to discuss their requests and I needed more time to consider them. Parent 1 told me to take it up with Parent 2, who was still at work. Here was our brief exchange:\n\nMe: Hey Parent 2! I told Parent 1 this morning that I need to postpone our conversation. I have a lot going on with my family and I haven\u2019t had a chance to collect my thoughts, nor am I in the right headspace for that conversation. I am emotionally drained and I need the weekend to reflect. Thank you for understanding!\n\nParent 2: That\u2019s disappointing. I am over booked next week but we can meet Monday at 4pm but it will be off the clock at that point, since childcare duties would be finished for the day.\n\n\u2014\n\nI am an hourly worker, just like the other 11 employees they have. They are fully aware they cannot require me to attend unpaid meetings. \n\nFeeling backed into a corner, I sent them an email over the weekend to let them know that I was hurt by the text message from Parent 2, and I wasn\u2019t interested in making changes to our agreement halfway through our contract period. I stood my ground about our sick care policy and let them know I needed to follow it from now on. \n\nWhen I arrived to work yesterday, Parent 2 was passive-aggressive and Parent 1 made it clear that they were offended and we would be talking about my email. I don\u2019t handle hostility well and I was very anxious all day - not a great state to be in while caring for a baby. Right before I left, their baby was crawling from a 6 inch cushion onto the floor and face-planted on the carpet on the way down. Baby was not injured and there are no marks. I apologized profusely and truly felt awful; I was anxious and frazzled and I looked away for a moment to grab something and it happened really fast. Not okay, totally my fault, and I own that. But truthfully, they are a baby learning to crawl, and it happens; they have even told me about that exact thing happening when I was not there. \n\nToday when I walked in the door, they fired me on the spot. They said they no longer feel comfortable having me care for their child, citing \u201csafety concerns\u201d over of the crawling incident yesterday. \n\nI am 100% confident that they wanted to fire me before that happened, but had no cause, so they would have had to pay my significant (~$4k) severance. Instead, they found a reason to fire me for cause that would not have been a fireable offense had the contract negotiations not been an ongoing issue. \n\nI am filing for unemployment but it is likely to be denied based on their stated reasons for firing me. I am a student and in a tough spot financially, especially now.\n\nDo I have any recourse here? Would small claims potentially side with me to grant severance? Is there anything else I can do?",

But generally small claims court isn't expensive, you don't need a lawyer, and if you win you can get the fees awarded to you as part of the damages anyway.  $4k is probably within the limit of small claims court.  \n\nIf you need the help of a lawyer, you may be able to sue for the legal fees as part of the damages; that may depend on your state as well as your contract.",

If they refuse the severance, sue them in small claims.\n\nIf you sue, don't talk about the hostility or the contract stuff.  Point is, you were fired on the spot for no reason and denied your severance for no reason, and it's required in your contract.",

You can be professional.  You can refrain from bringing up the contract disputes you were having or accusing them of retaliating over that.  And you can also be tough and indicate that you know your rights and will consult with a lawyer if you need to.  \n\nUltimately if they do choose to make damaging false accusations about you to other people, that would give you a cause of action for defamation of character.  If that happens, talk to a lawyer.  \n\nOne thing you can do is - from this point forward, communicate only in writing.  That way, as much as possible, you'll have a record of what was said.  This will be particularly helpful if they make threats of this kind in advance of saying negative things about you.",

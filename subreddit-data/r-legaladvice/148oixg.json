    "postText": "Hi so today I ordered from McDonald's and got the complete wrong order. I ordered over \u00a325 worth of food ond got given nuggets and a burger. I called uber and was told my account was 'flagged' and they would not be giving me a refund. I'm really upset by this because I've never asked for a refund for anything u\nI haven't been given. \nI have pictures of my receipt of what was meant to be given, the receipt attached to the bag we received, and the contents inside the bag. However they didn't care about seeing this and even after speaking to the manager he just said 'well hope next time will be better' \n\nSurely this cannot be legal to literally take my money, give me just 2 items instead, and then refuse a refund without even seeing the evidence. I did also record the second half of the phone call with the manager to be safe.\n\nI really don't know who I can speak to that's higher up or raise the complaint? I really don't have a lot of money and now don't have anything to order food with tonight because of this so I'm just really emotional with the whole situation",

    "postText": "Hi, I know this sub is based for the most part on US law, although if anyone has any knowledge on UK law and what steps I can take on getting my dog back legally.\n\nSo cut a long long story short, my family was separated), and I was looking after our family dog (my mum had her chipped a long time ago when she was a puppy) when I lived at the house of family friends.\n\nHowever, my girlfriend made a serious allegation against one of said family friends to the police, and I believe and support her fully.\n\nAs you can imagine, I didn't want anything to do with them after it happened, and I left in a hurry, stupidly without taking my dog with me, as the only option was shared housing (where I wasn't allowed to keep pets, and because of family separation, asking family to take care of her for the time being wasn't an option).\n\nSaid \"friend\" argued my dog isn't going anywhere, and that I'm an asshole for defending my girlfriend. So going to their house and trying to resolve it civilly isn't possible \n\nI have called the police about it numerous times, only for them to say they can't really do anything.\n\nMy mum also said that the documents to prove she is her owner are long gone, as a lot of things got left behind when she was moved into temporary housing.\n\nMe and my girlfriend now live with my mum and we all want to get her back, but have no idea what to do legally.\n\nMany thanks",

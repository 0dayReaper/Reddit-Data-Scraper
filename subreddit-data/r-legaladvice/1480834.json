    "postText": "Bought a computer in may of last year off the website, it worked for a few months and then started having issues. Blue screens, and all sorts of garbage. Called Newegg about it, they told me to get it fixed under the manufacturer warrenty. I finally took it to get fixed around December, and then there was an agonizing amount of back and forth as nothing worked. Turns out the part that was broken was an upgrade from the seller, so it wasn't even covered. So I tried to get in contact with the seller. No number. Won't answer emails. Work with Newegg to force their hand and make them respond. Send the computer back. Get a 'new one' back from them that is in the exact same condition. Bad hard drive. Constant blue screening. Warranty has finally expired and Newegg is washing their hands of the entire thing. Saying there's nothing they can, nor care to do.\nI've gotten at most 4 months of use out of the fucking thing, total. And now I'm out 1500 and stuck with a broken computer. I have a paper trail from microcenter showing just how long I've been trying to get this thing fixed. Do I have a case? Who can I call?",

            "comment": "Newegg has turned into an Amazon of sorts focused on computers.  They provide a platform for third party \u201cstores\u201d to operate but they also do sell direct.  If you didn\u2019t buy direct from Newegg, but through a sellers store, then Newegg isn\u2019t the warranty provider, the store or manufacturer is solely responsible.  Newegg itself may buffer some, provide customer support and sometimes take a hit and refund when the store won\u2019t but that\u2019s not a requirement.\n\nYour best bet is to, very honestly, try to network locally to find the nearest neighborhood geek or independent repair shop.  For a portion of the cost of the computer they can \n1) fix it - surprisingly many issues can just be driver and firmware fixes, or could be as simple as a loose connector\n2) if they can\u2019t fix it they can at least systematically diagnose the unit.  That is, strip it down and add one piece at a time until you find the problem.  Then either replace that part or run without it.\n3) if it\u2019s a critical piece they can probably help get the best scrap/sale value.  I.e if the gfx card is toast you can either piecemeal or as a system sell the rest for $700-$1000 pending actual specs.  Sometimes gfx cards alone can yield $300 on fb marketplace.",

Replacement arrived after the warranty expired, so I'm just trying to figure out a course of action that doesn't involve just scrapping it. The previous one had a faulty hard drive, which I sent back to have replaced, instead they sent back a, supposedly, brand new pc. Though it's having the same issues. No idea if it is just the hard drive again, but I don't exactly have the money to toss at this thing just to find out.",

    "postText": "A relative inherited several firearms including shotguns, rifles and a handgun. The previous owner owned a farm and must have purchased them from someone without any documentation. My relative is concerned they'll get in trouble for possession of these guns. \nThe relative does have a license to operate a firearm in the state of Rhode Island.\nShould they just contact the local police department to hand them in or is there a legal procedure they should follow regarding this?",

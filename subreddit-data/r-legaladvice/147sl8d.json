    "postText": "Hi there\n\nThis question is about a UK supermarket (which i wont name to for my protection). The short version is i overhead a staff bullying incident when the store was quiet. It was related to a worker who stopped to help me but was later shouted at for it. I approached the manager to say sorry it was my fault. She was surprised i overheard and just talked over me saying it was just a joke.\n\nI wrote a google review about the incident mentioning her name. The last time i went in there for no reason she stood next to me while at a self-service machine. As you know you are concentrating on scanning and have to tap your card (its a bit like using an ATM). because of where she was she happened to be standing in front of my shopping, to me it felt like a form of intimidation, saying shes in control and what i want is not important. I later wrote to the head office via the website and they said they didnt see anything significant. So what should I do?\n\nThe guy investigating said he only saw her near me for a few seconds and that she appeared to be doing something work related. Im not sure if he rushed his investigation, or was expecting something dramatic and was disappointed by how dull it was on camera. It was also on my mind the that he may have gone there in person and had to talk to staff. What is stopping the manager or a close colleague making something up or tampering with the story?\n\nWhat would you recommend doing? i do realise i can avoid this supermarket but if my family want to go there i feel stupid saying i dont want to go because i dont like a woman there. shes just a frail woman in her 50s, not very bright but able to make people uncomfortable so she feels like a big person. I thought about approaching staff to get a story (so it doesnt sound just like one person complaining). But im aware some staff dont know me and might be afraid to talk about a manager behind her back (or might report back to the manager what i attempted to do which would only escalate things.\n\nThe other drastic option is to approach the police. but i think they would want me to go back in the store and get a more obvious example of harassment for them to have a case. but i really dont have time for someone like that to mess with my mind. Also the complaint process with the company made me feel depressed and almost ill which is not ideal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: Just to get a sense of the place. The store has probably 50 members of staff working there. So its quite a large store. I received a message saying i should post this in the uk version of this subreddit but they have made it private apparently so its not easy to join.",

Those are really the options.\n\nIt's not illegal to be rude to someone, but if her behavior escalated to the point where she was actively interfering with your shopping or otherwise harassing you then that would be the time to escalate your response as well (and either call the police or try again to bring her behavior to the attention of her superiors).",

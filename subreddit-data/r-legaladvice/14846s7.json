    "postText": "Hello friends,\n\nI\u2019m posting this for my roommate since we both don\u2019t know what to do. So, my roomie Beth (24) has been trying to get closer to her bio dad after her moms death she still very new to having a dad around but doesn\u2019t know if she can legally ask for financial help. quick back story, she was born in the US but her mom took her to Mexico where she grew up. She moved back few years ago and since then she found her bio dad who was aware of her but not once helped with child support or anything really. Now that she needs help getting a car someone from her job told her she could sue her dad/get child support? I\u2019m not sure if that makes any sense but if anyone has any legal advice on what to do or what can she do now that she\u2019s older. \nOh yeah we are located in Texas and yes she\u2019s done DNA tests. Thank you for reading",

If her late mother had a child support judgement against dad &amp; dad owes back child support then moms estate could pursue it but doesn't seem to be the case here.",

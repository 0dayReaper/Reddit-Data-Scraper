    "postText": "I\u2019m getting a ton of PMs since this thread is locked. There is more discussion happening here in case it\u2019s of any interest: https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/dr2eua/laop_may_not_have_been_arrested_at_the_gate_upon/\n\n\nUPDATE 2.5: There\u2019s been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don\u2019t need to always make a \u201cspecial request\u201d to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it\u2019s a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is \u201cnot an obstructive item\u201d.\n\nAmazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3\n\n\nUPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA \u201cescalating out of control\u201d. They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don\u2019t want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. \ud83d\ude1e But that it\u2019s up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don\u2019t want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. \n\nShe assured me that I won\u2019t get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. \n\n**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I\u2019m NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don\u2019t plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p \n\nFor those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I\u2019m a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. \n\nForgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It\u2019s just that I talked back (\u201cno I don\u2019t but okay\u201c) and I regret that so much. \n\nHalloween is over but she spooked me to the core. \n\nSomeone asked if it\u2019s a racial thing. I\u2019m not white but it\u2019s probably not a related to race. \n\nMany of you guys advised not to delete the post and keep it here in case this happens to someone else and they need answers. Hope this helps. \n\n\u2014 \n\nUPDATE 1: Thank you so much for your quick advice on a Sunday morning! I memorized some of the lines you wrote below.\n\nAs we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija\n\n\u201cThe police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights.\u201d \n\n\u201cOk.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh I hope so.\u201d As she walked away. \n\nI burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. \n\nThere was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I\u2019ve been an emotional wreck and can\u2019t stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. \n\nMy seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. \n\nThank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least! \n\n\u2014\n\nOriginal post: \n\nI can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. I\u2019m flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don\u2019t have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ve looked all over the internet and can\u2019t find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. \n\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n\n..\n\nI was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. \n\nRight before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. \n\n\u201cYou have to put your feet on the ground!\u201d I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. \n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t but okay.\u201d As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I\u2019ve taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. \n\nEven if it\u2019s technically not allowed by some rule I\u2019m not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. \n\nShe immediately escalated: \n\u201cWould you like to go back to the gate? We\u2019re gonna go back to the gate!\u201d And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. \n\nBut right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. \n\nShe came back to my seat and barked: \n\u201cPolice will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.\u201d\n\nMy seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, \u201cno I don\u2019t but okay\u201d are now the cause of a police interrogation. \n\nHer statement caused me to panic inside. I\u2019m now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. \n\nSo I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAm I fucked?",

Make it clear that you immediately complied, and that she threatened to have police waiting for you despite your compliance. \n\nIf they still refuse to let you fly, you may be able to convert your status to another airline by saying that you're unhappy with your current airline and want to move to theirs. Some will grant you the equivalent level for the year, for example. \n\nEither way, you need to move quickly.",

            "comment": "The reference would be to either an \u201cunruly passenger\u201d (failing to comply with repeat orders from flight crew) or \u201cinterference with flight crew\u201d (intimidating or assaulting flight crew in performance of their duties). Likely. The former is an FAA civil ordinance, the latter a federal crime. \n \nIf the police are waiting, don\u2019t bother telling your story or arguing - let them remove you from the flight and simply invoke your 5th amendment rights: \u201cI am invoking my 5th amendment right to silence and am requesting an attorney present for all questioning.\u201d \n\nPick a new airline, because this one might ban you.\n \nEdit: If you were the aisle seat, I can see why the FA requested you remove the sling for takeoff/landing. It\u2019s the same reason why they require personal items to be *fully* under the seat in front of you. The path to the aisle must be clear so the passengers can swiftly deplane in an emergency. If the sling poses a trip/tangle hazard to you or another passenger, it is fair to request that it be stowed. \n \nBased on the described narrative, I don\u2019t believe this should rise to a violation of either statute. If MSP (or an Air Marshall) pays you a visit, follow the prescribed \u201cno comment/5th amendment\u201d script and seek a defense attorney for a consultation. \n \nExpect the Airline to ban you - IMO id probably be working on getting those trips cancelled/refunded and rebook on a different airline.",

I will not answer and questions without my attorney and do not consent to any searches, I want my attorney.*\n\nThey may nevertheless conduct searches, do not fight, do not do anything other than say that you object and have not consented. If they ask you questions repeat the part about remaining silent and wanting your attorney. Do this no matter how much they say it\u2019s just minor or that it will be easier if you cooperate. As much as airport police/the TSA would like to think they are the Nazi Gestapo, you do still have rights in the US even when in the airport.\n\nEdit - Formatting",

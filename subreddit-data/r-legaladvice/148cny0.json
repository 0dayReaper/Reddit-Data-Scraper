    "postText": "I have been a resident in a nursing home since May 1st. I am only here temporarily while recovering from an accident. There have been a lot of problems with my care and the facility in general. I don't want to do anything until I am discharged because I fear retribution from the staff. Who do I contact to help the residents I'm leaving behind receive better treatment? I have already spoke to the Director of Nursing and the Administrative staff but no changes were truly made so it has to go above their heads. Thank you.",

If the accept Medicare patients you can also try the Department of Health and Human Services or the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but you\u2019ll probably get more traction at the state or county level.",

            "comment": "Once you are discharged you should request a full copy of your medical record from the facility. You\u2019re entitled to a copy of your record under federal and state law. You want to get it before you begin making formal complaints. \n\nAfter you have your record, you should file a written complaint that specifically states the problems with your care and the care of other patients with the state governmental authority with jurisdiction over the facility - probably the state Department of Health. There may also be an Ombudsman who oversees skilled nursing facilities. If so, you should contact that office as well. Finally, you should make a quality of care complaint about the facility to your insurer. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have commercial insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid, insurers take these complaints very seriously as they are paying the facility for care. \n\nAll of the above entities have significant power/authority over the nursing home. The state Department of Health can restrict, suspend, or even terminate the facility\u2019s license. Every state has written regulations pertaining to the quality of care. If you make a credible allegation that the facility is not meeting the standard of care or that the facility is engaging practices that endanger the lives or well being of residents, the Department of Health will investigate. Depending on the investigation\u2019s findings, the Department of Health may impose penalties/sanctions and a corrective action plan requiring the facility to fix the problems in order to keep its license. \nSimilarly, some states established Ombudsman to monitor, investigate, and prosecute nursing home operators who neglect their patients or engage in fraudulent activity. \n\nIf the issues you experienced resulted in mental or physical harm or injury, you should also contact a lawyer about bringing a lawsuit for negligence or medical malpractice. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you experienced mistreatment while seeking medical care and support. You\u2019re doing the right thing by trying to hold the facility accountable.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo I live in student halls as of right now (moving out sooner because of the incident). On 31st may/1st of June, in the middle of the night one of my flatmates had gotten drunk - angry drunk it seems. My friend and I (both live here too) came back to put things in the kitchen, and he was in there ranting about his pot being moved and how dare anyone touch his shit - that's when I notice one of my mugs has been smashed in the sink. He denies it at the time but everyone else had an alibi and with his behaviour, it made sense.\n\n1st June, at 12 I go in to see that he has destroyed mine and other people's property and trashed part of the shared kitchen space.\n\nThe sink was full of gunk, and I knew there was at least 1 broken cup, so avoided going into it.\n\nOne of the affected flatmates emptied the sink and these are the following things that were ruined\n\n- a branded Hobgoblin pint glass (smashed)\n- a mug (aforementioned)\n- 3/4 kitchen knives (bent)\n- at least 1 cutlery knife (bent, seemingly over the door)\n\nAlso, my air fryer drawer was missing, later found in the freezer.\n\nHe had left the day we found this, and has apparently recently returned but I'm not back until Thursday. I feel incredibly uncomfortable and don't have any trust in leaving things around someone that seems dangerous. I have contacted the reception of my accommodation and they stated they would email him, but is there anything I can do about my things that were destroyed?\n\nAlso, to add, our sink counter was ruined by what he had done. A worker came, slightly lifted it and it came off.",

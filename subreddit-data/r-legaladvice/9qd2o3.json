    "postText": "Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. \n\nI get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. \n\nThe first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. \n\nAt this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. \n\nI ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, \"it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!\"\n\nSince then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?\n\nEDIT: TN, USA",

You fall under what we call the \"Young Adult\" period, age 18-26 but covered under parental insurance (I am assuming you are on your parent's plan, based on your age and being in school, but please correct me if I am mistaken). This does NOT give your mother consent to receive your test results or private info. Under HIPAA, any request you make for your mom NOT to receive your private info must be honored. Additionally, you should contact the insurer and ask that any EOB containing sensitive information not be mailed to your parents. This one gets trickier, it is hard to suppress EOBs sometimes, but I implore you to try. Report the practice to the OCR, if they are violating your privacy, they are probably doing it to others. ",

They thought because they were married they were entitled to their spouses medical records and insurance info. But that's not true. For insurance you need to sign paperwork to be approved on the individual's account to have access to your info. Or you can get a verbal agreement from the individual. But that only lasts for the duration of that phone call. And if the individual passes away thats more paperwork to prove you're their spouse/son/daughter POA etc. Always contact these companies to get the paperwork filed ASAP. ",

They never even tried to contact you. It\u2019s not just that they violated your privacy, they deliberately didn't give a patient their own test results! What if your mom was abusive &amp; they told her you were pregnant? Or if your mom wasn\u2019t speaking to you &amp; you were unaware you were pregnant &amp; engaged in risky behaviors? \n\nAs if the rest of this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the pregnancy test gets to me. I don\u2019t know if someone at the doctor\u2019s office got some snarky satisfaction passing that on to your mom or what, but *no one* should get those results but you.\n\nWhen my kids turned about 12, their pediatrician always had a conversation with both kid &amp; parents. That he was *their* doctor &amp; they could come to him with anything &amp; he would not disclose it without their permission. We had to verbally agree &amp; sign a form that we would pay for any treatment &amp; respect the kid\u2019s right to privacy. Under no circumstances would he or anyone in his office betray their trust. He would then have the kid explain back to him what that meant, &amp; that they could come there for anything, even just information.\n\nFile the complaint. These people are breaking the law &amp; somehow think their relationships trump your rights as a patient. Do it for the other patients who may not even know this is going on.",

For example, in some states staff can report a UTI to a mom or dad on a 16yo, but NOT a pregnancy result.  \n\nYou\u2019re 22, no question there, which is why this is so weird. \n\nCouple things.  Have you ever at any time signed a release for Mom to receive info, on anything, like years ago and you forgot?  That could linger in your EMR as a scanned document and \u201cyes\u201d to release info to \u201cmother\u201d.  Also, is it possible mom is posing as you on the phone?  Patient identified questions could possibly be answered by a mom.\n\nCall whomever runs the clinic/hospital.  Not clinic staff, administration of clinic staff.  Demand to know why your pregnancy status, at age 22, was reported to your mother instead of you, why you heard your pregnancy status from your mother, not the clinic.  Say it\u2019s not the first time.  That will trigger a wave of hell for the responsible party, as well as a possible blast zone for unfortunate coworkers (no one likes yet another bout of HIPAA training which we all do yearly already).  It will result in policy such that no one\u2019s mother inappropriately receives private info again.\n\nDon\u2019t gush or yell when you make this call.  Do not do a spoken version of wall of text via the phone, that makes people process \u201cangry\u201d and shut down to all but every third or fifth word you say until the noise stops.  Ofc you have a lot to say, but admins aren\u2019t trained in people so much as they are in policy.  Stick to the pregnancy results, demand to know why it happened and how to fix it from happening in the future, and then answer their questions if they have any (day/time of occurrence).  Again, no wall of text level speech.  That call alone should purge the problem from the inside, for other patients as well as yourself.  Someone may get fired, know that in advance.  Unless mom was posing as you on the phone.  HIPAA file too, but this will work faster for you, like within the week.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub.

I'm 22 and no longer even live with her.**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n&gt; Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. \n&gt; \n&gt; I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. \n&gt; \n&gt; The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. \n&gt; \n&gt; At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. \n&gt; \n&gt; I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, \"it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "Title says it all, I received a request to sign an estoppel. I asked the landlord if they have to sign it and they said no, despite there being a field for \"receipt/acknowledgement\". Does a estoppel need to be signed by both parties to be valid, or just the tenant? My understanding is that it is a certificate, not an agreement, so only tenant has to in order for it to have weight. Thank you",

    "postText": "I am supposed to have a meeting with an attorney assigned by our auto insurance company. My insurance said to claim fault for the accident (which I disagreed with) or I could get sued. Well, I accepted fault and still getting sued for more than my policy covers. \n\nWhat are some questions I can ask the attorney? This is new territory to me. A friend said that recording every call with them is a good idea. Any other advice? \n\nTo add, the process has not been transparent. I\u2019ve been in the dark with no information being provided. I\u2019ve reached out to the attorneys office several times with no response. They were supposed to contact me yesterday, but nothing. Is there any recourse?\n\nLastly, the other party is claiming the injuries I believe are false and/or severely exaggerated. Is it worth hiring a P.I. To conduct surveillance? Thx",

Ask what the estimated damages are, what the policy limits are and how they see the case playing out. Also, if they're as unresponsive as they sound, you can always switch attorneys",

    "postText": "I own an older home in Florida, built in 1930, and I have a tenant occupying the property since March of this year. Due to the older home, I have a septic tank which was inspected when I purchased the home as my primary residence in 2020. \n\nIn my lease, I have a clause that states; \n\nThe Landlord shall not charge a fee for the unlimited parking. The Parking Space(s) can be described as: Lawn parking available anywhere on property except within 30 ft of rear of home due to septic field. Any damage to septic system and costs related to, due to excessive weight placed upon the septic field, will be at the responsibility of the Tenant(s).\n\nSo my tenant has a work truck and he apparently drove over and parked his truck over the septic tank which caused it to collapse. He informed me about that and claimed full responsibility. He got quoted by a few places on repairing the damage BUT it turns out that my septic tank is so old and no reputable company would want to repair it because it would be out of code. I guess they have to pull permits with the county and it wouldn\u2019t legally be allowed. I\u2019m not too sure to be honest. Just trying to gather information currently. \n\nI know the replacement and upgrade of the septic would be maintenance but since he caused the damage to the septic, who is truly responsible? Replacing the septic is about a $10k job and I\u2019m not trying to stick my tenant for that but I honestly don\u2019t know what to do and how much room I have. I also live out of state and just had a baby so I personally don\u2019t have $10k right now to get it fixed. \n\nLet me know your thoughts! Thank you.",

But that doesn't make him responsible for the entire system.  \n\nWhat's the difference in cost between \"repair\" and \"replace\"?  He'd be responsible for the money to \"repair\" and you'd be responsible for the difference to \"replace\".  Depending on the damage, this might be very little or no money, but that's approximately where the split would come in.",

            "comment": "I would check with your home owners insurance.  And the tenant's automobile insurance.  I think you might be hard pressed to find him responsible for damage to an almost 100 year old system.  Honestly, I think it might be easiest to work out something with him.  If he agree's he's liable and has money to pay you, that might be the easiest.  Think of it this way.  You have a junk car barely runs, and it's totaled.  You are only going to get the value of the junk car, not it's value to use.  He damaged a system that was on it's last legs.   Maybe ask for 10%?",

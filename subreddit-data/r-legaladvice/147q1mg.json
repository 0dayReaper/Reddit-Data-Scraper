    "postText": "About two years ago I worked for someone and helped them redesign their website. At the time I told them they can get extra ad revenue from the site but i never got to adding the bosses payment and instead put mine. So for 2 years I've been collecting about 200 bucks monthly from those ads.\n\nI got a message asking for the email address to access the adsense for the website because they're having trouble getting payemnts (which i don't have anymore \" and i replied \"I'm not sure what the email address or password is but i could help you make a new ad account and tie it to your site so you can start actually collecting payments\"\n\nRealistically what's the possibility of being caught and what could happen if i am.",

If that's the case you could go to prison, or be forced to pay restitution and fines. \n\nAs for how you can get caught I'm not entirely sure but can't bank transactions be tracked?",

The only thing they can base off of are any w-2's from Google they receive that are under the owners name and social security number.\n\nunless they can go and ask Google themselves and Google use the w-2 info to then give out the bank number associated and then they have to prove it's my bank account, there doesn't seem to be any other way of getting caught here, unless a straight up admit anything.",

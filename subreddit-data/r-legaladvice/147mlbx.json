    "postText": "Almost a month and a half ago, I (f) had to kick out someone (m) who was staying with me. They weren't paying any rent but I'm the owner of the house. I don't know if this makes it a tenant/landlord situation or not but they were staying here so they could get back on their feet since they just moved back to this city.\n\nThe reason they got kicked out was because they made threats and created a hostile environment. They also refused to vacate the property on three separate occasions of telling them they need to leave and during the last fight when I told them they can't stay here they said, \"if you don't take my cat then I'm giving her to the Humane Society,\" and \"I'm leaving by end of day, keep my stuff. Sell it, whatever.\" They didn't end up leaving.\n\nThe day they officially got kicked out, I had called non emergency to ask if we could just lock them out because of the threats and unsafe environment and they said yes. They also confirmed if ex roommate stepped foot on the property to call them because it's now trespassing and that we could also request that they need to have a police escort to get their things.\n\nI informed now ex roommate of this day of and provided them with a bag of clothes and some other personal items. Their only response was, \"well, I have a job now.\" That was the last thing they said and didn't say anything for 41 days, then out of blue sent me a message saying they're coming next week to get their things and pet. I reminded them they need a police escort as confirmed by police but they refuse. I do not feel safe with them on the property otherwise.\n\nBased on what they said during our last fight, my partner says that ex roommate already relinquished ownership. Is this true?\n\nBased on how much time has passed with zero indication they were coming back for their stuff or pet, do they have any legal right to it still and can I withhold it if they refuse to have a police escort?",

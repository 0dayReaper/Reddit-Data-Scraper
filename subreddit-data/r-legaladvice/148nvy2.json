    "postText": "Sometime around 4/20/23 - 4/30/23 I contacted Comcast via the online submission form indicating my desire to discontinue service. They said a rep would contact me, which never happened. (In retrospect, I wish I had documented this step better, but it\u2019s no longer relevant to the crux of the issue.)\n\nAnticipating trouble, I turned off my auto payment so they wouldn\u2019t keep charging my card. Sure enough, I later get a bill for $164. Up until I cancelled service, my account was always current and always paid with autopay. \n\nOn 6/5/23, I disputed the charges via text-based customer support, and they indicated they would clear up the charges and my final statement would read $0. I have screen shots of this conversation.\n\nOn 6/12/23, I receive a bill in the amount of $120. I called customer support and recorded the call (letting them know I was recording). They took off $48, leaving a bill of $72 (the equivalent of one month\u2019s internet usage). \n\nHere\u2019s we\u2019re it currently stands:\n\n1. Comcast and I both agree service is considered discontinued on 4/20/23 - documented on audio recording.\n\n2. Comcast and I both agree no data was used after 4/20/23 - documented on audio recording.\n\n3. Comcast and I both agree my last payment was on 4/10/23 in the amount of $72.\n\n4. Comcast says payment on my March bill was for February service, even though my March statement, generated on 3/14/23 clearly says it covers \u201cService From 3/21/23 - 4/20/23.\u201d (I tried to upload this bill, but was not allowed). This is the bill that was paid in full on 4/10/23.\n\n5. Comcast says even though the bill states it\u2019s for service from 3/21/23 - 4/20/23, it\u2019s actually for \u201cFebruary service\u201d. Those date indicate the dates that I can \u201ckeep my service.\u201d \n\nThis is insanity. I feel like they are gaslighting me. And I threatened taking them to small claims court in Illinois, and they will not budge.\n\nIt appears in IL court costs are $89 for claims up to $2,500. \n\n1. What are my options for suing when they don\u2019t owe me money, they\u2019re just threatening to send me to collections (I\u2019ve never had anything sent to collections, ever, and my credit score is about as high as you can get)? \n\n2. Should I pay the $72, then sue, or let it go to collections?\n\n3. Does going to collections allow me to sue for damages? Can I sue for damages if it doesn\u2019t go to collections?\n\n4. Can I sue for punitive damages or to account for my time in fighting this?\n\nThanks in advance for your help, y\u2019all!!",

You say your last payment was 4/20.  You say service was canceled 4/20.  Surely you owe them *something*.  It seems what we\u2019re fighting over is less than $50?  For me, I\u2019d pay.  You\u2019re obviously entitled to your other conclusion.  \n\n3. No.  Not in and of itself.  \n\n4. No. There\u2019s no statutory provision for that.  \n\nI\u2019m confused about a lot of your story.  You say you told them you wanted to cancel and they said someone would get back to you.  That doesn\u2019t sound like a cancelation.  It sounds like a promise to talk about cancelation.  But if they\u2019re calling it canceled as of that date, good for them.  One guesses the amount you owe is not zero.  This is a tough fight to have over a few dollars.",

                    "comment": "Appreciate the advice. Thank you! My last payment was on 4/10 from a bill that covered service from 3/21-4/20. They\u2019re claiming that bill covered service from a non-articulable period before that, despite the bill being very clear about the period covered.\n\nI understand that my request to make an appointment to cancel service does not count as a cancellation date, and I\u2019m willing to accept that, and even pay a prorated bill, but they agreed to consider that a cancellation date. The issue I have is how difficult it is to cancel. It should be criminal. What is the acceptable number of times I need to request an appointment to cancel? One, two, ten??\n\nI understand that it\u2019s a very small amount of money I\u2019m fighting over, but it\u2019s the principle. People need to fight back against abusive corporations.",

In particular I\u2019d be pretty supportive of an \u201cit must be as easy to cancel as it is to sign up\u201d requirement if that were well drafted.  If you want to advocate for that change in law, you might find some support.  But that\u2019s not the current state. \n\n&gt;What is the acceptable number of times I need to request an appointment to cancel? \n\nThat\u2019s a complicated question.  I\u2019ve never had to call Comcast more than once, so I\u2019m struggling to identify with your challenge.  In the sense of \u201cis there some number of times or number of days to wait\u201d after which you\u2019ve \u201cdone your due diligence\u201d and will win the argument, there is not.  There\u2019s no automatic here.  At some point there\u2019s a reasonable person standard that could be applied.  That number is more than one attempt to schedule.  \n\n&gt;People need to fight back against abusive corporations\n\nSetting aside the moral implications and specific allegation against Comcast, that is a lot easier to do when you\u2019re 100% right.  As it is, when this shakes out and it turns out you still owe Comcast $29, you\u2019ll be delinquent on that $29.  And outcome like \u201cjudgment for Comcast for $29\u201d is altogether possible.  I\u2019d not risk that on a principle.  But again, you\u2019re entitled to another conclusion.",

I really don\u2019t disagree with your analysis.\n\nAgain, I wouldn\u2019t mind paying a prorated amount, I\u2019m absolutely not opposed to paying what I owe. I just feel gaslighted that the rep couldn\u2019t even articulate what dates the March bill covered. The best I could get was \u201cthe \u2018service from\u2019 date range on the bill does not reflect the paid dates of service, rather the bill covers service from some duration last month.",

    "postText": "So, I live in Texas and am experiencing something I've never had to deal with before. My neighborhood was part of a HOA that was court-ordered to dissolve years ago but at that time the county never took over the maintenance of the roads. In the years following, the roads have obviously completely turned into disrepair. This is leaving the neighborhood without adequate 911 services, utilities are constantly getting stuck or unable to perform their duties, etc. The neighborhood has contacted the local commissioner for this area but he keeps insisting that the community is still private even when given a copy of the court-mandated order of its HOA dissolvement and a petition from the people in the neighborhood. I am at a complete loss on what else can be done here and what other recourse I may have, does anyone have any help? I already reached out to legal-aid and they informed me given the multi-household issue they could not help. ",

                            "comment": "Someone else explained what CAM stands for. I live in a neighborhood where we have a private road. Every property owner who has a driveway directly off the road actually owns the property up to the middle of the road. An easement was established for the road, people entering and leaving, and utilities.\n\nYour neighborhood may be in that situation. It may be that no one owns your road. Regardless, you need the road to be in good order and the county hasn't agreed to take possession of it. It's possible you could ask the county to do so, though it sounds like they may not be interested. Your neighborhood needs to set up some process for maintaining the road and it will almost certainly involve everyone putting in some money on a regular basis.\n\nExample from my neighborhood:\n\nIn my neighborhood, we have a road association (like an HOA, they can collect dues, are responsible for maintaining the road, and can put liens on people's houses for non-payment). Our dues are only $100 per year, though they are usually more in other associations.\n\nWe have an executive board made up of three residents, one whom acts as secretary/treasurer. There is supposed to be an association-wide meeting once a year. We're supposed to hold elections for board seats at that meeting.\n\nFor a long time (starting before we bought our house), the executive board was just three long-time residents who collected $50 a year in dues, hired a relative to do road maintenance (very poorly), never held official meetings, stayed in their positions without elections, and our road sucked. They either moved or passed away, so a few other residents agreed to take over the positions (my next door neighbors, in fact, plus some others). They immediately worked to get everyone to agree to come to a big meeting at their house, held proper elections, and got things back on track. They put a dues increase to a vote, which passed, people started paying up their back dues (since they saw a functioning association), and they're working towards getting our road in better shape.",

            "comment": "Just because the HOA that used to maintain the roads has ceased to exist doesn't mean that the county is obliged to maintain them.  Often before a county or city will accept obligation for a road, it will require whoever is trying to give it to them (usually a developer) to build it to a certain standard, so it won't immediately cost a ton of money to fix.   If it's build out of pie crust and black paint, the city/county will say \"no, thanks; call us after you landowners that benefit from this road have improved it to our standards\"\n\nAs someone says further down the thread, one option is for you and your neighbors to all agree to pitch in to improve the road(s)...maybe to the degree that it's just barely passable, or maybe to the degree that the county will agree to be responsible in the future.",

At which point, my city would take over the road (making the private road publicly owned) using the bond initially and then city funds afterwards.\n\nThe \"certain standard\" might have some wiggle room. For instance, (and I don't know your true circumstances) they might request a 40 rural cross-section road (curbless, with ditch on both side), but if asked might allow a 20 foot rural cross-section road, saving a great deal for your neighbors.",

Consulting a real estate attorney to figure out how to achieve any of this may be helpful.",

In that case an employee who shows up at 3 should be given her check and told of the new rule for next payday. \n\n\u201cYou can receive you pay by direct deposit or by live check between 12-2\u201d is generally pretty reasonable.",

She's nice to me but she's kind of in a more professional sense unsavory. She puts people on blast in front of customers and fellow coworkers instead of privately talking to them is just one example. Not that has anything to do with this question it's just really shitty",

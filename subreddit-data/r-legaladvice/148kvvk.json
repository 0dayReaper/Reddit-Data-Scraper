    "postText": "In Utah County, UT. For context, our landlords sent me and my partner an invitation in March of this year to sign for another year, despite our current lease not being over until July. They were raising rent by $250 at the end of our current lease, but in exchange for signing early, they offered to only raise our rent by $150. We had one week to sign the new lease, and they said \"If you do not sign by that time, this offer will expire, along with the discounted rate.\" We declined to sign.\n\nIn our current lease, it states that our contract will default to a month-to-month agreement at the end of the lease agreement unless either party gives a 30 day notice before the final day. Neither party sent the notice, as we have a new place lined up in August so we wanted to stay one more month (knowing the rent would be raised the full amount for that month). \n\nBut when we checked in with them yesterday to make sure everything was all taken care of, they claimed that by us declining to sign the early lease agreement in March, it qualified as us giving them a termination notice for our current lease, despite that being nowhere in writing. They are saying that now we have to sign for another year, and then sell the rest of our contract if we would like to stay another month, otherwise we have to leave in July.\n\nI personally can't imagine any reasonable person interpreting that by declining to sign a new 1-year lease early, it somehow terminates a separate contract by default. Any advice would be highly appreciated.",

We chose not to take that option. We have not been provided nor provided you any notice of intent to end our lease, and expect the lease to switch to month to month terms with an adjustment to the rent cost July 1st as per the terms of our current standing lease.  Best wishes.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll likely respond by giving notice. If they do, acknowledge it and confirm you\u2019ll be out at the end of July.  If they don\u2019t, give notice yourself a few days before the end of June.",

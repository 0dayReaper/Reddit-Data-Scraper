    "postText": "I am an nurse and i am currently a Permanent resident here in Canada. a few years back i have signed a contract from the united states to work as an RN in tenessee as an immigrant worker.  In the contract it stipulates that in the event of a breach i would pay around 21k. It went to a point that i am documentary qualified and now i am just waiting for an interview. However, fast forward, due to a series of unfortunate events i decided not to go forward with it. May i ask what should i do? Should i just leave it hanging and not respond to them anymore? My problems were really personal and life changing. Will the US laws reach me here in canada? Sorry for my bad english.",

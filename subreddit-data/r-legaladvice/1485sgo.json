There is also a hotel and airport nearby. \n\nHow do I get the cops attention on this? It seems to be getting ignored even when the fireworks are going off near to the residence.",

You report it to the cops, but honestly expect this to be low on their priority list and depending on where you are they may pay very little attention.\n\nYou can try reaching out to your local officials to apply pressure, and encouraging your neighbors to do the same.",

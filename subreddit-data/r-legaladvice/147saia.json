    "postText": "My sister lives in IL but is getting married in TN. There\u2019s currently a lawsuit against a TN law that bans online-ordained ministers from officiating weddings. They want a close family friend to officiate (who was ordained online) but we obviously don\u2019t know the outcome of the lawsuit yet.\n\nAssuming that the state law in TM stands, if they got a marriage certificate in IL and had this family friend sign it, would this be acceptable? They technically aren\u2019t getting married in IL but could do a small/intimate ceremony at their house if needed to. Does the state of IL even care about such details or do they just want the certificate completed by the right people (minister, couple, witnesses)?\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Mazel tov !\n\nIt is a universal matter of jurisdiction that a marriage license issued in a US state may only be solemnized within the borders of that state.   You cannot solemnize an Illinois marriage license in Tennessee, period.\n\n&gt;They technically aren\u2019t getting married in IL but could do a small/intimate ceremony at their house if needed to.\n\nThey would need to \"technically\" get married in Illinois.  That includes the celebrant, the spouses, and their witnesses all signing the marriage license.   Once the ink dries, they will be legally married in Illinois.    They can do it in the car on their way to the Tennessee wedding event, but they have to be physically on the Illinois side of the Ohio River.\n\nAfter that, they can go have a ceremony, celebration, sacrament, or any other kind of event they wish, anywhere, with any celebrant or officiant.   A lot of people find that getting civilly married before the public exchange of vows relieves all sorts of stress and complexity.\n\n&gt;Does the state of IL even care about such details\n\nThey do, to the extent that a judge might rule that an Illinois marriage certificate that was solemnized outside Illinois is not valid.    \n\n\"But how would they find out\" is a question answered with a broad gesture toward the divorce courts.\n\nI recommend that these Illinois residents obtain an Illinois marriage license and have an Illinois-approved officiant solemnize their marriage inside Illinois, and then celebrate their marriage with friends and family later.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend that they get a license in IL, wait one day (required by IL law), and get married there.  IL allows those ordained online by the ULC to perform weddings, and they don't require witnesses.\n\nAfter that, they can have a ceremony in TN, and just not file any paperwork for that one.  The states don't care how many ceremonies you have, they just care about the licensed one.\n\nIt might require some creative timing if they want their anniversary to be on the same day as the ceremony, but there's no law against celebrating your anniversary on the wrong day, either.\n\nAlternatively, they could get married in TN by a notary public, and then have their friend officiate at a ceremony.",

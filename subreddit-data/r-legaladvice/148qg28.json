    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI have a friend who works for an after school program.\n\nThey recently had to arrive at 6AM for a field trip the school planned for the kids, once there they got all the kids ready and went on said trip. After the trip was over they were back at the school around 6PM. However some parents were running late and my friend wasn\u2019t able to leave until 6:30PM.\n\nThe school is saying that my friend will only getting paid 5 hours as that\u2019s the standard amount of hours they work a day, and the rest of the time they put in will be considered volunteer work. Their excuse is that parents would chaperone and they wouldn\u2019t get paid for it so the same applies to my friend. However this was never disclosed to my friend or any of his co workers\u2026\n\nThis definitely feels illegal.. is there anything he can do?",

    "postText": "I was injured during a show back in December 2022 and was hospitalized for 10 days. I underwent 2 craniotomies as a result of the TBI and had a lot of procedures done. As a result I am still undergoing treatment in the form of physical therapy, speech therapy in addition to the multiple medical follow ups as a result of injury. I am now overwhelmed by medical bills and am unsure if there is a way I could sue LiveNation for said injury. I do not remember it happening, last thing I know was that I was at the show and then I woke up restraint to the hospital bed. Every other detail was pieced together by a friend who also did not see me get hit or anything like that. I have tried contacting the venue but there is no answer so I am unaware if there were any videos or any additional information since I have been unable to get in touch. Any help would be appreciated",

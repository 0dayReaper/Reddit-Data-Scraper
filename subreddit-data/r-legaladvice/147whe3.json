    "postText": "So a friend of mine is living in her late grandmothers home that was left to her. The will was never probated(not sure if that\u2019s the correct term) by her mother who is the executor. The grandmother passed away in 2016.  The home has not changed ownership or been titled to my friends name at all. \n\nWhat, if any, sort of action can be taken?",

I was referring to other taxes as well, personal income taxes, etc.\n\n&gt; I forgot to mention the home is mortgage free as well.\n\nAlso great, but does the *estate* have any other debts? Those have to be paid prior to her being able to transfer anything into her name. What state is this in?",

    "postText": "My girlfriend and I signed a two year lease for a second floor apartment in an old house in Dobbs Ferry, NY. When we signed the lease, we were told the yard is ours to use as the downstairs tenant doesn\u2019t have a car and doesn\u2019t use it. This worked out great for us as we have two dogs and would love to host some barbecues and things for our friends (all things that were in the original listing for the apartment as well). Within the first month of moving in, the yard has continually filled with sewage. We were told this is because the other tenant keeps flushing things down the toilet that shouldn\u2019t be flushed ie wipes and feminine products. \n\nWe\u2019ve been \u201cin the process\u201d of this getting fixed for months but now we\u2019re at a point that there\u2019s no end in sight. The yard stinks. There are bugs. The neighbors all around the house have complained to us AND to the landlord and yet we still have no end in sight. Today I came home to find the landlord stashed his totaled truck in our yard and is now waiting for the insurance to take care of it so now half the yard is filled with a broken pickup. \n\nWith all this said, we\u2019ve also had packages stolen and money stolen the one time I paid the rent in cash. He blames the tenants downstairs but they\u2019ve been nothing but nice to us so I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019ve had any legs to stand on in accusing them or approaching them with regards to this. He also has done nothing to help in these situations. \n\nWe\u2019re good tenants. We take care of the trash. We pay our rent early every month. We\u2019re super respectful of noise for both our downstairs tenants and our neighbors around the house. We\u2019re trying to make the best of it all, but I feel like we\u2019re getting played. We pay over $2000 a month. \n\nDo I have any standing in telling the landlord that I think if the yard is going to remain uninhabitable that we should get some kind of decrease to the rent? Would it be reasonable to see if we could break the lease at the end of the year? \n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve been really on our own. We lived in a family owned apartment for a few years previously and I feel like we\u2019re being taken advantage of because we\u2019re young and in our 20s. I\u2019m just trying to figure out solutions or at least have talking points when I talk to the landlord. \n\nThank you guys for your help.",

            "comment": "What does the lease say about use of the yard?  \n\nIt's possible that the lease does not grant you use of the yard, even shared use, in which case you can't expect any kind of rebate for not getting to enjoy the yard.  \n\nYou can ask a county / city health inspector to evaluate whether the sewage in the yard is a habitability issue for you in the house.  It may or may not be; if it is, you will have some recourse and would be able to break the lease if the landlord doesn't address the issue after that. \n\nIt doesn't hurt to just talk to the landlord and ask for some accommodation.\n\nThe landlord isn't responsible for packages being stolen.  As for your rent being stolen - don't ever pay with cash except in a way where you can immediately get a receipt from the landlord.  Like, if there's a drop box don't drop a cash rent payment in there, ever.  \n\nIf you had a receipt and the cash was stolen after that, it's not your problem, it's someone stealing from the landlord and not from you.",

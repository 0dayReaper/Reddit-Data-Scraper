    "postText": "So for context I have been checked out of the marriage a while. I\u2019m the sole caretaker of the 10 animals we have and the land we have. He comes to the land maybe a few times a year but only if I beg. Is it possible that he can get it and the entirety from me? Is there anything I can do to prevent this? I don\u2019t want all the animals on it I just don\u2019t have anywhere else to go and he does. I don\u2019t want him to take this from me knowing that I don\u2019t and he shows no interest in moving out of his parents place. We live in sc if that helps.",

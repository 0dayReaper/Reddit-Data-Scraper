    "postText": "Hello, I as reading through the web and Virginia law and it is incredibly confusing and vague. The main thing I want clarification on is what the landlord must do before conducting non emergency construction. I read online that they must work with you to decide a \u201creasonable time\u201d and then give a 72 hour notice. The law itself does state \u201creasonable hours\u201d but it\u2019s about the 72 hours warning and I\u2019m not sure which sentences and clauses apply to what. I couldn\u2019t find much case law or clarification on anything\u2026 Whoever wrote this is a damn idiot. What can I require my landlord to do for notice?\n\n\nMy other question is whether or not they can give a \u201c72 hour notice\u201d that just states \u201csome day Monday through Friday next week\u201d. I honestly think that\u2019s outrageous because that\u2019s not really a notice. If they\u2019re gonna just say that then what\u2019s the point in a notice anyways? I think they screwing us all over and I want to make everyone join me in holding them to it if I can. Otherwise, I just want to know my rights so I can enforce them without getting in trouble for denying entry.\n\n\nLastly, they illegally entered my apartment one day after they sent a wrong notice. It was a totally different set of days that didn\u2019t overlap and a different are in which they moved all of our stuff. There was no way we could have had any idea they came. I was gonna let it go, but I want to seek legal action now because they won\u2019t apologize and keep pushing my limits. I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re just ignorant or they\u2019re trying to gaslight me into thinking I\u2019m being rude. Could they get in trouble for sending non legit notices? If others didn\u2019t agree to it and the notice was incorrect, could I add them to a court case with signatures and then have a lawyer include them? I\u2019m just fed up with them trying to force me to bend to their will instead of just asking nicely. I\u2019m sure everyone else feels that way but they don\u2019t know their rights. I could get their Permissions and signatures easily but they all might not actually want to do anything.\n\nI appreciate your help and wisdom. I truly couldn\u2019t find a legitimate trustworthy interpretation of the laws, and they are just written so vaguely. I can\u2019t ever tell what refers to what anymore. Amen to everyone who helps my poor uneducated butt out!",

You can take them to court if they violate the law, you can perhaps break your lease without penalty. \n\nAre you looking at \u00a7 55.1-1229? It's not just what the law says must happen, it's what someone can do if they think the law isn't being followed.\n\nThey aren't going to ask because if they ask, that's making it seem like they have to ask. No law or lawsuit is going to make them apologize. And yes, \"next week\" is enough notice.\n\nWhat sort of construction? Do you have to relocate? Because the law is pretty clear on that.",

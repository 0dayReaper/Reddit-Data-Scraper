    "postText": "So I believe due to negligence of my dealer that I bought a used car from has damaged my car. But I also for sure believe if they werent deceptive before they are now. They keep trying to claim my car has an oil consumption issue and want to do a test to use a warranty I didn\u2019t even know was put on the car by manufacturer. Apparently I bought the one that wouldnt even cover what Im dealing with. Anyways they had my car and topped it off on oil claiming that there was less than half the oil left in tank. So in 2 weeks/800 mile span it is shown to have consumed quickly and large amount. I had been checking the proper way when they topped it off it was hot and barely shut off for 10-15 minutes. It was always on the full line. Anyways since then I continue to check my oil frequently and it has not burned any and I found it to be overfilled since them topping it off. I take photos now each time even videos. Which I keep telling them its overfilled and they seem to just brush it off claiming that my car has an oil consumption issue which Im now sure they are lying about. I believe they are trying to skirt liability for their negligence when I first bought the car.  they are lying about it having oil consumption issues. I have no leak my dipstick showed on full line now shows overfill and stayed that way for over what is now a little over 500 miles over one week of driving since then. Would this be considered fraudulent since they are trying to document/prove this along with failing a test to use a warranty. Its also apparently a manufacturers extended warranty that was wasn\u2019t disclosed when I bought the car and the one I \nhad paid for \u201cwouldn\u2019t cover what (Im) dealing with\u201d. Is this alone fraudulent can I do anything besides staying on top of them about this? I bought the used car last month and had issues from beginning no engine or oil light. Certain they improperly or didnt fill oil and Im still dealing with effects and dealer is attempting to avoid liability/paying.",

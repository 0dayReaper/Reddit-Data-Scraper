    "postText": "I am going through a bitter divorce and, as commonly happens, my ex decided to accuse me of domestic violence in order to help her case. She lost. She straight up lied and I was able to prove it when I cross-examined her (I am representing myself, BTW).\n\nHowever, she did get a temporary restraining order. It was rubber-stamped when she made the accusations and was in effect until the trial. I had never been in this situation and was caught completely off guard. But the TRO required me to sell my guns (and incur costs associated with the transfer), then buy them back after the trial (and incur more costs).\n\nMy question is very simple: how can a mere accusation, in a civil case, deprive someone of their constitutional rights?\n\nI also want to challenge this law. Is anyone interested in helping me?",

    "postText": "Sorry for the long post \n\nSo in my house I had Vivint and i had sold my house end of February. I even paid off all the alarm systems so there is no outstanding balance on them for the next home owners and even paid off the remaining bill. According to the contract getting medically retired from the navy is one of the reasons they allow to get out the contract. I talked to services that specializes in military and I sent in all the information to cancel my account and that was in March. Then last month I had to talk to someone else because for some reason it didn\u2019t go thru and they resent a cancellation email which I responded to as well. Today I got this email it wasn\u2019t approved for: A valid Notice of Cancellation has not been received.\nYour account still has a remaining balance.\nYour agreement term length has not been met\n\nSo I\u2019m just trying to get advice since I gave them the cancellation info in the email when they asked, paid my bill, and don\u2019t have to go the length since I got out of the military for one of the reasons they accept.",

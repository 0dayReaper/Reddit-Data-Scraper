    "postText": "Two people live together in an apartment in Huntsville Alabama for over a year, both have keys to access the apartment, have many belongings inside including medications, and both receive mail at the address, but one of the two is not a named tenant on the lease. The named tenant on the lease unexpectedly has passed away. The unnamed tenant after learning of the news, decides to go over to a friend's house for support. When the unnamed tenant returns back home, his key no longer unlocks the door because someone has changed the locks. He contacts the property manager and they inform him that they have changed the locks and the deceased's mother now has access to the apartment. The unnamed tenant, who is disabled, goes to the office to discuss the situation and they allow him to get his medications from the apartment but only his medications, escorted by a police officer. He still has no access to the apartment. The following Monday, one week following his partner's death, the apartment complex tells him that he has to get everything out of the apartment by the end of the day. Can anyone provide any information regarding the unnamed tenant's rights to the apartment, what are the laws pertaining to this situation, what options could be explored??",

I was wondering if we could get some type of legal documentation on our dog to prove that she is in fact ours\n\nI'm in the state of Alabama, USA",

Vet records are also a good reference, as is any documentation from when you adopted her.\n\nIn an extreme case, see if you can find someone else who you trust to watch your dog for a while (to prevent your grandmother from, say, taking the dog and hiding her).",

    "postText": "This is in Kansas btw. So I have a protective order hearing in a few days and I\u2019m worried about how it will go. So context I\u2019m currently on a rotation in Germany training foreign soldiers and since the start of the rotation I\u2019ve been getting harassed by my ex through social media phone and any way he can get in contact with me. I\u2019m not really sure how me presenting my evidence will go I have screenshots of emails he sent a bunch of them were from email address he made just to harass me. I had deleted that email address back at the start when he kept trying to email me. He then moved to using Facebook messenger, instagram, even trying to report me for being suicidal to make my life hell. I was able to use one of those websites where you can search people off and was able to find one of the email addresses he used. Would that be able to be used as evidence against him?  \n\n I don\u2019t know I\u2019m just worried about him he\u2019s already made multiple twitter accounts pretending to be me posting my nudes and one of the accounts didn\u2019t just have like 10 followers it had upwards of 2k followers. He\u2019s said multiple times that oh I hope you bring legal in I have my basses covere, you better win because I\u2019ll make your life a living hell. I\u2019m worried about not being granted a PO and him making my life hell.",

            "comment": "The evidence such as screenshots and emails you intend to present during your upcoming hearing must be submitted to the court in the proper format.  You may also need to present copies to your ex.  Look up the civil rules of evidence, check out your court's website about PO's or contact the county clerk for instructions.  I would recommend that you contact an attorney for assistance.",

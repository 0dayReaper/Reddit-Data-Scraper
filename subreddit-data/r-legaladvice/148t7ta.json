    "postText": "My dad owns an old jeep that needed a lot of body work done on it and we got it back after a few months. It needed a new battery because it sat for so long and so I bought an new battery and replaced it. Long story short, my dad is an alcoholic who I've been trying to get help for years but he refuses. I want to try and limit the opportunity he has to go out and buy booze by removing the battery and replacing it with the original dead one and telling him if he wants to buy his booze he'll have to replace his own battery. Legally speaking, the car and title are his and I have proof I bought the battery. Am I risking legal trouble if I remove the battery? (Pennsylvania)",

    "postText": "So, I'm a female  who works in a HEAVILY male dominated work environment (100+ men, 4 women, I'm the only one who does technician work the others are admin), I'm currently 11 months postpartum and am pumping at work. My assistant supervisor pulled me into his office today and asked me if I was studying while I was in the mother's room. Apparently there's been several comments made that I'm spending \"too much\" time in there and no one can \"ever\" find me. Which I feel is ridiculous because I only pump twice a day during work hours, and I try to center those times around our schedules breaks so I'm not losing too much \"work time.\" I feel this came up initially when a stock room employee asked me how my studying was going, as I'm taking college classes at the recommendation of my supervisors for a possibility of promotion. Then asked if that was what I do \"in that tiny room\". I corrected him saying that was a lactation room for mother's and he was very apologetic saying how he was mistaken because when I walk by I'm carrying a \"school bag\" -i carry all of my supplies and pumps in a backpack- this all may be moot as I won't be pumping for much longer anyways, but how can I protect myself from these accusations?",

The answer to the question is \u201cno, I\u2019m using the lactation room for pumping and I\u2019m doing so an appropriate amount of time.\u201d\n\nIf the conversation continues on, \u201cI\u2019m not really able to respond to generalities. Is there an actual documented problem with my performance?  Are there specific times when people haven\u2019t been able to locate me when I was needed?  Are there specific tasks that weren\u2019t completed as needed?\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not on you to explain every detail of your lactation experience and plans because a few people don\u2019t understand it and have some vague feeling that you\u2019re somehow getting paid to \u201cdo nothing.\u201d",

Then link him the DOL link [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/nursing-mothers/faq](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/nursing-mothers/faq)\n\nI would then add that it made you very disappointed that people were gossiping about you going there to study, when you are actively postpartum and need to pump milk to your child. You hope that your response clear the matter because you are professional, and do not want this to tarnish your reputation in the office. Something along those lines.\n\nYou should send an email because then there is something in writing about this if it comes up again. This is how to protect yourself.\n\nAt the beginning, I never sent emails when shit came up at work because I was like \"Oh it's just going to be worse\". Well, then came to bite me in the ass and people lied to covered theirs, and I was screwed. So always document over email!!! Always. You have a convo about anything, you email your supervisor a summary about your meeting\n\nEdit: You can ask your supervisor if you should email him before/after you go to pump so that he knows you are temporarily out of your desk. I don't know if this would be worse or better, but if people are complaining on purpose, documenting when you pump could help.",

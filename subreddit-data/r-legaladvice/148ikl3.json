    "postText": "Back in may, some guy backed into my (18f) PARKED car while i was at work. My neighbor happened to be outside and took photos of the damage and even got photos of the license plate. Guys just walked into the bar and did not even try to to contact me. I turned it into the police and they sent him fines. I haven't heard of an update since, and i've been trying to contact them weekly. They just said that he won't respond and there's nothing else i can do other than then to turn it into my insurance. This would raise my rate and I would still end up paying for something that I have full on proof of who did it. Should I turn it into my insurance and see if they can investigate? Or would it not be worth it if my deductible goes up. Just really frustrated that I might have to pay for this, and not sure what to to legally because I feel pretty screwed over right now.",

There may be as much or more chance of their success as yours in litigation.  \n\nThis is why you have insurance.",

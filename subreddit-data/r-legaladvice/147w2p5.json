    "postText": "I worked for a remodel business for over a year and a half as a sales rep.\n\nWhen I left the company, I had bunch of pending jobs (sold jobs that had not been installed yet) upwards of 7-10k in commissions. \n\nNow it's industry standard that once you leave, you don't get paid until all the jobs are installed and you're paid in a lump sum.\n\nNow 3 months after I had left , I sent an NDA for final payment saying things such as I won't post anything on forums or social media etc etc. However, the issue is this the final payment is barely $1000. Much less than what I am owed. \n\nThey are claiming a had a lot of jobs cancel or be rejected. \n\nThe issue is that they're claiming I've been more rejects and cancelations than I had the entire year and a half I worked for them. I've heard horror stories just like this from other previous employees. \n\nAt this point I don't know what to do. I was thinking of hitting them with a counter offer of the minimum I feel owed ~$3,000 \nI'd love to put them on blast on glassdoor, indeed, anywhere I can. But I'm unsure of what to do.\n\nEdit: state is FL",

That includes the 1k they're offering but require a NDA. \n\nOr you can negotiate. But it's unlikely you'll get more than 1k while still able to blast them everywhere.",

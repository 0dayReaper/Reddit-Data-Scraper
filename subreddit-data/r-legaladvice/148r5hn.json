    "postText": "Hi everyone, so recently my wife put in her notice to quit her job. She works remote and given a laptop (which was waiting on the employer to finish setting up the programs). When she put in her notice, the company didn't respond for a week and then cut her email. They have not requested back the laptop and have cut all communication with her. I was wondering if there is a time limit I leagally have to wait in order for me to claim the laptop and use it as my own? We could not find any information in the documents my wife signed when she started about company property.",

Wait for them to figure it out and ask for it.  Send it back when they do.",

    "postText": "I got a speeding ticket in Sonora county, California for going 70 on a 55 speed limit road. I am from Georgia. Can anyone answer below questions I have\n\n1) it's been about 2 days since I Received the citation. I don't find any information about the fine I will have to pay or the points that will be added to my license. On the court website, when I search with my citation number or driver's license number I am not finding anything. Should I look at a different place apart from the court website to get more details about my citation? How many days will it take before the court website is updated in general?\n\n2) I was driving the car of my relatives and they were present along with me. They have insurance for the car. I have a driving license but not a part of the insurance of the car I was driving. Will that affect anything in my case?\n\n3) In the future should I report I got a ticket to my car insurance providers in Georgia. I read online Georgia is not part of ticket sharing DLC with California\n\nThank you anyone for reading and replying to my post",

California points don't matter but Georgia will probably find out and give you some points according to the Georgia rules.\n\n2: None of that matters for the ticket, and also, you were covered by their insurance as an occasional borrower.\n\n3: I wouldn't.",

Others don't have to be registered as authorized drivers.  So this allows you to lend your car to other people on occasion, you just can't use that to let other household members drive if you haven't registered them as drivers for that car.\n\nAlso, if you have auto insurance of your own, even if you weren't driving your own car, you could still be covered when borrowing someone else's car, including a rental car.",

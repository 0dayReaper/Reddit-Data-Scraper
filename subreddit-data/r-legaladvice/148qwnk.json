I do not want to get in trouble for not supervising children, I already have a lot on my plate. I do not know if the signs pertain to the culture that the community watches over kids seen by countries outside of the US.\n\nEdir: Currenltly in Colorado, Fort collins USA. I see these signs in public areas around the state. I pasted a link in the comments of an example of the sign in question.",

            "comment": "The reason you are having a hard time finding legal information regarding these type signs is that the signs have no legal weight or authority.  These signs are put up to remind parents to watch their own kids in various businesses etc. so that their kids do not annoy or bother employees and other patrons.",

I'm responsible for my kids behaviors without them and I'm not more responsible for supervising them because the sign is up.  \n\nThose signs do not, and could not, make you responsible for someone else's kids.",

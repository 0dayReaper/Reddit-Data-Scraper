    "postText": "A bit of background to begin with. My now wife and I were engaged last year and had picked out a location we wanted to get married. This place originally only held parties and celebrations and has never actually held a ceremony before. We are living in England so places need to hold a wedding license in order to host a celebration, which this place, at the time we placed the deposit, didn't have. That deposit being \u00a31000, roughly 20% of the verbally agreed cost of the facility. I'm unsure of what the rules surrounding deposits are. Id like to know if there is a loophole if there was no contract so sign.\nI think it's worth noting the date we had verbally agreed upon was September time in 2024 so we think we are giving pretty reasonable notice of cancellation.\n\nAnother thing about this place is that it is terrible at responding to emails or anything. In retrospect, we should've taken that as a warning. They'd told us they were expecting to receive their wedding license in March time and told us they'd inform us when they had it, but never did. Communication has been sub par at best. We'd question whether we could claim funds back for a terrible service.\n\nNext is the reason for our cancellation. Unfortunately we have had family in another country fallen ill (cancer for 2 grandparents) and we feared time is running out and wanted to visit for our honeymoon. So we brought the wedding forward and planned and went ahead with it in just 3 months. We knew we couldn't plan a wedding with our original venue in that time especially with the dismal communication. We had it in our council hall so it was easier and simpler.\n\nIt took us 3 emails and a message on Facebook to finally reach them and we were told that unfortunately all deposits are non refundable and in that same email they informed us that they got their wedding license, not that it really matters now.\n\nSo I'm coming to the wise nation of Reddit to provide me with an answer. Is there a chance of me getting the money back or is this just another example of bad financial decisions? If I don't get the money back it's not the end of the world but it would be nice to have a little extra money to put towards the honeymoon",

You can still be sued for the money, or have it go to collections. They have a pretty solid claim against you. Deposits are, by default, nonrefundable, and they spent money on the license.",

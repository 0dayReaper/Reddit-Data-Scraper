    "postText": "I have the only notarized copy of my 90 year old mom\u2019s living trust. It says when she passes away my sister gets 50% of the estate and I get 50%. There is no will, no other document except this trust. My sister wants me to mail her a certified copy. We live in California, would a certified copy be a valid document? And my brother\u2019s name is not mentioned because he has caused my family so much grief. Can my brother contest a living trust distribution? Thank you.",

    "postText": "hello all, im currently living in my apartment in Burnsville, which I\u2019ve been staying at for over a year. Today, I got a call while visiting my girlfriends house from some contractors at my apartment letting me know that the cleaners of the apartment above me (2nd floor im on the first) left some valves open while the water to the building was turned off, and when they turned them back on, flooded that apartment and mine since it dripped in through the ceiling, I already took photos and videos of all the damaged areas and my belongings that I believe could get ruined and I\u2019m still talking to the contractor trying to make amends and get the place cleaned up. The person I was speaking to did say that some sort of reimbursement is possible, aka a hotel, however I have 4 cats so finding a hotel for them to pay for is out of the question I\u2019ll more than likely stay at my girlfriends house and work from there until it\u2019s cleaned. What can I do to make the most of out of the situation and since I\u2019m not technically staying here can I have rent reimbursed or discounted? Another problem is my rental insurance just expired so I\u2019m not sure if I can get much at all back for this inconvenience.\nAny advice would still be appreciated",

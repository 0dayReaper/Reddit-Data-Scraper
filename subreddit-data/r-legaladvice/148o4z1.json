    "postText": "So I have a neighbor that has been not so neighborly as of late. I\u2019ll try to give some context to the situation:\n\n1) encounter 1:  I\u2019m exiting my house opening the garage door with my dogs and right at that moment a man and his dog are walking in front of my house. I grab my one dog that is barking/acting more aggressive and let my other dog run up to the owner/dog bc she is much more social/friendly and better trained to voice command. (Btw I am exiting my garage, they are not on leashes, intending to load them into my car before work). The man proceeds to start yelling and cusses me out for about 4 minutes in front of my house. He makes no effort to try and get away or leave \u2026he just lingers, eventually I apologize (albeit twice bc he was in such a rage) that the situation happened and finally he starts walking away from our house.\n\n**our leash laws in our municipality are that dogs can be off leash if they are on our property and under control, must be leashed when on public property\n\nSo our neighborhood is like one giant dog park and there\u2019s dogs everywhere, majority of dogs are trained and owners all seem to be good with keeping them under control when off leash, every once in a while a dog might get loose and run up or down the block but this is pretty infrequent. My next door neighbor brings one of her dogs with her everywhere so he is often off leash in her driveway or front yard, but he does tend to wander off at times off her property. \n\nAfter this encounter, we find out that this angry guy has cussed/yelled at her a couple different times as well. She is a nice older lady and my husband and i are pretty surprised she has been on the receiving end of this guys verbal tirades more than once. \n\n2) Encounter 2:  Fast forward about a week, my husband sees this guy out walking his dog and proceeds to park his car and walk up to him and confront him in person. Guy obv gets hostile, at one point he pushes my husband, husband doesn\u2019t do anything, no real productive conversation other than he admitted to having PTSD from a previous violent encounter with a dog, my husband tells him that it would be helpful to try and explain this vs yelling and berating ppl on the sidewalk, guy proceeds with his walk and tells husband to fuck off.\n\nNow - after speaking with various ppl, many are telling myself and husband to file a report against this guy. The guy did threaten to call the cops on my husband for harassment\u2026 but then he proceeded to push him so I\u2019m not sure how much merit he would have with that. \n\nBut just looking for any advice or insight- just don\u2019t want to regret not filing a report down the road, but also don\u2019t want to escalate to situation either. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nPS- fun fact, the older lady neighbor is actually the mother of the police chief in our city",

            "comment": "So to quote your laws:\n&gt; allows dogs off leash\u2026 if they are under control\n\nA dog that runs up to someone on a public sidewalk is arguably \n\n1. On public property now as sidewalks are either public or at a minimum easements \n\n2. By definition not under control since if you command the dog to return and it ignores you to continue approaching the person it\u2019s not under control. \n\nYou were in the wrong at first even if it was harmless. He may have overreacted to you, but as a dog owner you\u2019re overly confident in how your dog will behave with a stranger. Dogs are animals and act unpredictably as such. You know your dogs disposition, but this neighbor does not. Yelling and screaming like that is in some degree excessive, but after his explanation you have to admit there\u2019s a sensible reason for his reaction. \n\nThen your husband confronts him and now your neighbor went too far again. He did commit simple assault, but you also violated a leash law. You\u2019ve both wronged each other once. Call it even. \n\nThe easiest and smartest solution is to avoid taking your dogs out when this guy walks by or make sure they\u2019re on a leash. It\u2019s not a smart idea to provoke people like this even if you\u2019re 100% in the right. He\u2019s already shown he\u2019s the type to overreact.",

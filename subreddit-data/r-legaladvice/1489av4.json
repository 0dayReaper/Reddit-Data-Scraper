    "postText": "There is this video game company that false bans people a lot (the moderators can't comprehend their own rules)(so they ban you for stuff when you aren't actually breaking the written rules) if I get false banned I want to file for arbitration. Is it legal for me to tell other people that got falsely banned to and how to file for arbitration? Or does this open me up to a lawsuit by the video game company? \n\nNote: the game cost $20 to buy. So theres an actual point of going to arbitration. And yes assume Im right. They are 100% false banning according to their rules. I know everyone always says \"I got banned for no reason\".",

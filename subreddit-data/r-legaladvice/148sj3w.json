Look at some other posts for examples.",

I'll get all the info together it will take me a bit though as I can post screenshots here. Here is the response I got about the dishwasher issue back in January \n\nWe rent from Alcove and they said the following: \n\nThank you for your response. Regarding the provided screenshot stating Alcove's obligations, while Alcove is on the lease, we did not provide any of the appliances in the home.\u00a0The property manager provided all appliances in the home prior to any tenants moving in and is thus responsible for providing updates on repairs.\n\n\nIf you believe your property manager's current resolution is a violation of your lease agreement, you are welcome to request an reasonable ETA on when the dishwasher will be replaced via the support ticket. If he is not able to provide you with an ETA, you can also request a rent reimbursement or credit for the loss of the agreed upon value of the appliance until it is replaced using our\u00a0Tenant Reimbursement Request Form. Please note that this request is up to your property manger to confirm or deny, Alcove only provides the request.\u00a0\n\n\nIf none of these options or resolutions are to your satisfaction, you may of course decide to pursue any legal avenues should you so choose.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease let us know if you have any additional questions.\u00a0",

    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nI\u2019ve been renting a place for almost 3 years, I told them to repair the wood rotten windows before I moved in, they painted over them. \n\nAs soon as I moved in I broke window trying to close it as they wood was rotten and swollen, the window wasn\u2019t replaced, it took over a year for them to put a piece of carboard on them. \n\nThe end of last year, mould grew up on the curtains and mushrooms grew out of the carpet, which led to me becoming really ill and giving me asthmatic symptoms, the time has come for them to replace the window, which was supposed to be February this year, then it was pushed back to March, then pushed back to April, then they started in May. \n\nThey said it was would take a couple of days, they started work 3 weeks ago and have replaced the window, I\u2019ve got no curtains and the windows are screwed shut and it\u2019s blazing hot. I\u2019ve sent countless countless emails to the agency, 90% of the time met with no response. \n\nMentally I am becoming unwell, physically unwell I\u2019ve been so patient with them Ive tried to call citizens advice and I can\u2019t get through I\u2019ve been stood outside on hold for an hour, couldn\u2019t get through to environmental health on the phone.\n\nI am struggling and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAmongst other issues with the flat like the ceiling leaking when it rains and I\u2019ve reported it multiple times but nothings been done.\n\nBuilders have taken my items from the hallway and the agency has done nothing to appease this. \n\nAlso to note I\u2019m not in a contract with them at the moment, they didn\u2019t send one over when they were supposed to, but also I\u2019m kind of glad I didn\u2019t sign one, I didn\u2019t want to be tied down and be forced to live there. \n\nOnly reason I haven\u2019t just moved out is it costs about \u00a32,000 to move into another place. \n\nThank you",

    "postText": "I've been working as a software engineer for a small software company for the last 6 months. The main company is based in Japan and just opened a branch in Canada. I'm a Canadian citizen.\n\nIt seems that my boss is looking to extend his visa in Canada, and his lawyer is asking me to sign an offer of employment and an invitation letter as an HR manager of the company for his visa application.\n\nMy job title isn't HR manager, and I honestly don't get paid all that much at this job. Is there any liability in this for me?",

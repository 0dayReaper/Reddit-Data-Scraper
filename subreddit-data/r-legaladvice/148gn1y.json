    "postText": "This will be a long paragraph being the severity of this case . I must admit my first language isn\u2019t English so please bear with me . \nMy Dad has been in Taiwan for the past 8 years . He was sentenced to 4 years in prison and kept appealing until he was incarcerated about a month ago (the timing is important) \nIn 2020 we decided to put my dads Beach house for sale . At the time my dad needed the money to pay for lawyer fees and continue fighting his case in Taiwan. He wrote a power of attorney for my mom . We put the house for sale for 1.1 million  we stated to the realtor agent  we wanted an \u201cAS IS \u201csale  because we couldn\u2019t really afford major repairs . There was a leak and a very old sea wall that was in very bad shape. \nA few months we heard back from the realtor that we had gotten an offer . He wanted 1.035 million . He wanted us to fix a leak and some ninor things which we agreed and got in contract with them . At this time my father was in Taiwan and do to his age (85) he couldn\u2019t open emails so my mom and I ( his daughter ) would read them and sign what had to be signed . The realtor was aware of all this . And of my dad\u2019s situation.  We signed papers that allowed the buyers to get quotes on the sea wall even though we had not closed on the house . 4 before the closing of the house . Half of the Seawall collapses . \nThere was a tropical storm near by the winds reached to 50mph . \nWe call our realtor and let her know that the Seawall collapsed.  \nWe call my dad and he told us to let the buyers know we can help with 15k towards the Seawall .  And will go up to 20k.  Because it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault . We let the realtor know but she says the buyers are not agreeing and they want us to put it back to what it was\u201d \nWe are still at this point trying to work with them they ask us to clean up immediately and remove the palm trees because it will keep collapsing and they have already called the Seawall company they want us to us . This will Cost us 5k.  (Just to clean the palm trees) We agree.  After all this madness our realtor asks us to extend the closing because we have not reached an agreement.  They want us to pay for the whole Seawall they want us to use the company they wanted to use , they also want us stay in the house to foresee the construction and will not pay more for the property being that it was our responsibility to keep it \u201cas is \u201c.  Mind you we\u2019re now residing in California so we were only there for the closing of the house . My parents are completely on defense. We  do not settle on anything. Meanwhile the whole Seawall collapses and we have to pay about 100k for repairs . They start a lawsuit against us because we \u201cbreached contract \u201c 3 years later we are still in this situation we\u2019re not able to sell , or rent my dad is in jail for the next 4 years and I need help lol I need advice please someone help me this is all happening in the Tampa Bay Area. I need a lawyer (we couldn\u2019t afford the one we had and there was no sympathy for us it felt like we hired a robot ) I need advice on who to hire what to do . The house is now valued at 2.2 and they want to force us to sell to them at 1.035m and honestly we are being completely bullied by these people . If they were to made a fair offer we would have been open but at this point they\u2019ve never made an offer . They continue to harass us . We\u2019ve never counted suited back our lawyer just keeps billing us everything it\u2019s 14, 16k. 18k we\u2019ve already spent over 60k in lawyer fees my dad is in prison for 4 years and we have ran out of money . Now we have to move back to Florida in to that house in order to save( coat of living in California is killing us)  all my mom has is the power of attorney but she\u2019s not the owner . Can someone please help me",

In this sort of case maybe you can get creative with the legal fee and ask an attorney if they'll take a cut of the house proceeds when the sale closes.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad. I casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it. \n\nTLDR I think my dead sister is my real mom. In Florida btw.",

Or see if you can get a copy of whats called vital statistics /birth certificate from your county or city you were born in.\nI'm unsure the actual legal age you can buy a copy but certainly you \ncan call and ask.",

My biological fathers name was removed and the person's name who adopted me was put in its place. About 10 or 15 years ago I tried to get a copy of my original birth certificate and they said I couldn't because it wasn't public record or something like that. If that's the case in Florida as well then a birth certificate may not be that accurate in a situation like this.",

I've seen many instances where the adoptive parties/custodians did not follow up with this. If your mother is being weird about letting you see the certificate it' possible there weren't any changes despite them being your legal guardians. ",

There's still a chance that they didn't formalize the adoption and the original information is there. \n\nAlso, you can get a DNA test done on those 23andme type sites and it will sometimes match you with relatives based on your DNA and you can do the math from there.",

They probably want to protect you and if it is true, they may feel a lot of relief from finally telling you the truth. Don't let your mom or dad brush it off or dismiss your concerns. It can be very difficult to convince someone it's okay to come clean. Perhaps have a one-on-one with the more reasonable parent?\n\nI hope they listen to you. Worst case you have to wait until you're 18 as others have posted, but right now it would be nice to know. \n\nMaybe take pictures of what you found just in case they overreact and try to destroy it? And probably keep something with your sister's DNA although 100% of my knowledge of DNA tests is from movies so I'm not sure what you would need.",

            "comment": "I can offer some advice on obtaining and inspecting your birth certificate for any changes. I used to work for Vital Statistics office in Texas, Florida requirements may be similar: There is no age requirement when requesting Birth records, as long as you have identification that satisfies their requirements you are free to request a copy of your birth record. It's important to go to the county/city of your birth to obtain a \"long form\" or \"Original copy\" of your birth record. A short form would just be the information printed out and it's useless to determine if there were any changes or amendments to the original record after birth.\nA school issued ID may be  considered a primary form of identification by the county/city office when requesting a copy of your long form birth certificate. It's important to request this and not the \"short form\".  If a picture school ID is considered secondary, you could also use your Social security card along with a school id or transcript to prove your identity and satisfy their requirements.\nWhenever there is a change to the information on the certificate after the birth, there are tell tale signs of this. The file date of the certificate of birth should be within a month or so of the date of birth, if it's showing a file date a year or so after, that's a strong indication a new record was filed, usually for amendments or changes. \nThe format of the certificate could also be slightly different from another record that's been unchanged. You would have to compare it to a certificate of someone born around the same time as you, but generally it wouldn't match the same format the hospital submitted to the state. Since you're 16 it's possible Florida was using submitting records digitally and not handwritten, so I cant speak to how effective of a sign this would be. \nAlso, the name of the local registar for the county/city office or jurisdiction of where the birth took place should be on the lower corner. If it's the State Registrar's name at the time of birth and you're requesting this record from the municipality then it's an indication that the state received a request to change the record and re-filed it. \nA court order is absolutely necessary to make changes to any birth record, adoptions or a court order establishing custodial rights would be appropriate to petition the state to change a record.\n\nI hope you can resolve this with your folks, but if not this is an option for you to explore. Sorry for the long winded answer, I hope this helps!",

Ask some relatives at Christmas, see if a grandma or aunt has pictures of you as an infant or if your sister was absent from photos for a certain amount of time and then reappeared.\n\nPlease remember that it sounds like you're coming up on or have just passed the 10 year anniversary of her death and that must be hard on your parents.

Please keep in mind your parents  lost their daughter (even though she was 26, she was still their child) and it must be extremely difficult for them.  Maybe you could revisit the topic by explaining to your parents that you don\u2019t remember much about your sister and ask them to talk to you about her.  Explain to them how much you admire the painting and how you were looking for more, not snooping.  Hopefully an open dialogue will eventually lead to you getting the answers you are looking for.  \n\nIf they aren\u2019t the kind of people who are going to talk to you and you can\u2019t wait a little longer to get your birth certificate, do some research.  You could try googling birth announcements for your county, hospital, and birth date (look a few days after too). Florida Division of Library and Information Services has a search engine on their website that narrows birth announcements by county and hospital.  Most hospitals still provided birth announcements to local newspapers in the early 2000\u2019s.  It\u2019s not a birth certificate, but it could provide you with a clue.  \n\n",

My best and most general all encompassing advice is to be persistent in the best way you can for your parents.  Keep in mind it's very hard for all us children (because everyone on reddit is someone's child) to give each other advice about how to deal with our parents on the internet, where very few of us have actually personally met each other's parent's.  So I cannot really say for sure HOW to be persistent.  But you'll find your way.  For instance, with my parent's I'd probably have to bring this up to them at dinner, loudly, possibly as a joke, to break through their very structured and private shells.  Some parents would retreat even further into the shell of secrecy though.  You might try: bringing it up with the other parent, calling your parent's grandma/pa on \"accident\" and gauging their reaction, genuinely asking more questions about your sister because you are genuinely interested in learning about her life, asking more distant family members about it, expressing an interest in similar things as her like painting, or just listing out the reasons for your hypothesis and bringing up your theory in a situation they cannot escape (traffic on the freeway was my best friend in middle school.  I was fucking weird.)\n\nIn any case, keep in mind that your Mom and Dad (or Grandmom and Granddad) have raised you as their own, and surely they have gone through the worst tragedy that any parent can go through if they lost a child to suicide.  Any action you take to get at the truth, try not to force people to relive their worst traumas while getting there, ya dig?",

The fact is that you\u2019re going to see you birth certificate at some point (e.g. getting your license or a passport). That could be something you could remind your parents of. If they are hiding the truth from you, they must realize you\u2019ll learn the truth - probably in the near future. If you let them know that, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense for them to continue to hide the truth from you.\n\nAlso assuming your sister really is your true birth mother, it\u2019s possible your parents have planned to let you know one day but aren\u2019t ready yet - or think you might not be ready. When you started asking questions you probably caught them off guard and they panicked because they haven\u2019t figured out how or when to tell you the truth. If that is the case I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they realize it\u2019s time to tell you soon. It might be a good idea to tell your parents that if there is something they need to tell you that you\u2019re ready for whatever that might be and they can be honest with you. Just make sure you are ready going into that conversation for whatever they might have to say. Best of luck",

While it's true that 50% of your genetics come from each biological parent, siblings can get entirely different genetics from the same parent. We have many recessive genes that, while not actively expressed ourselves, can be passed down to our children. If his sister is indeed only his sister, there will certainly be some similarity, but will likely have less than 50% of her DNA due to his mother and father passing on slightly different genetics.",

Think about it this way. Let's say the sister gets half her genes from the mother, and let's assume it's perfectly random. That mean 50% of the moms genes are in her, 50% aren't. Now you come along and get half your genes from the mother. That could be have zero overlap or 100% overlap, but on average it'll be 50%. This obviously assumes that it is perfectly random, but I suspect it probably is a good approximation if it isn't. So in the end, on average you will share half your genes with siblings. Considering there are probably  a lot of genes (also not a biologists), it is probably pretty close to half most of the time (smallish standard deviation). ",

If you get 50% from Mom and 50% from Dad then in theory, two siblings could share only 0% of their DNA if they get entirely different sets from mom and dad. You could share anywhere from about 0-100%, in theory. Less chance of high overlap if there is a half sibling in there. But you could theoretically share more DNA with a half sibling than full if the numbers shake out weird.\n\nEdit: if they're sisters they'd share the same X chromosome from dad or brothers, the same Y chromosome. But in cases of opposite-sex siblings they could, in theory, share zero DNA. Genetics are weird.",

The possible combinations of the mother and father's DNA are infinite*, and the siblings could share much less then 50% (or much more). The mitochondrial DNA would be 100% the same from mother to sister to OP, regardless of which one is OP's mom.\n\nEDIT: *billions, not infinite. ",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

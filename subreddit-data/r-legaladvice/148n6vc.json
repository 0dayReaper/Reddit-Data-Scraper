    "postText": "Let me preface this by saying I should\u2019ve done my due diligence prior to purchasing the vehicle.\n\nI recently purchased a used vehicle from a local dealer. It\u2019s a bit older (2008) but I was desperate and I used my severance pay from my workplace so I could get going in new work. Odometer read about 180k. I decide to get the carfax after the fact and when the dealer purchased the vehicle it\u2019s was registered at over 285k. Looking back at its history, it doesn\u2019t look like a discrepancy since it has been constantly serviced every year.\n\nNow where I fudged up is I signed a disclosure of an odometer reading and it\u2019s signed exempt. I\u2019m already in over my head since the check engine light is already on. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this? My balance left on the vehicle is only $800 but I\u2019m on the verge of just returning it to the dealer and taking the 3k loss. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",

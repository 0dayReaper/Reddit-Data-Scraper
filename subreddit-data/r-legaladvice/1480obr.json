    "postText": "I'm wondering what the rules in the US are relating to email marketing, I understand businesses can't just spam promo emails thanks to the CAN-SPAM act of 2003. But for personal use, what is the legality of sending an email to randomly guessed (not purchased or traded) email addresses, asking the recipients if they would like to opt in to an email list.\n\nI do not seek to make money from this email list, and I am an individual. If they say no or say nothing, I will not send them emails. If they say yes, I will offer a clear and valid and quick unsubscribe option. I will promote nothing and no one in the opt-in option. This list contains no sexually explicit materials and the opt-in contains no media or links. \n\nThanks so much for the help.",

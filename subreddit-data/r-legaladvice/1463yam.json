Their house is physically connected to mine, and my doorbell has recorded evidence this was attempted arson, but police will not open a case or take evidence. What options do I have?",

    "postText": "I am looking to protect my family from a potential fire that could happen any night. \n\nThe first night, another tenant (we will call this person A) called in a wellness check after smelling smoke coming from the suspects apartment. The second night, the fire alarm rang, and the fire department came. \n\nMy doorbell camera shows the suspect pacing around, and looking at his building from the outside. He later brings in flammable debris into his apartment from trash around the neighborhood. Minutes later, the fire alarm goes off, and he is seen exiting the building right after the alarm goes off (literally a second or two later - he was already on his way out). There is a lot more video that from a common sense perspective is damning, but likely wouldn\u2019t hold up in court. I have little to no doubt he did it, both nights. \n\nWhat this means is if the debris catching fire was that he brought in, and if he did not call the fire department, then in my opinion it builds enough of a case to at least bring him in for questioning. The police however said there\u2019s nothing that can be done, as the fire department determined it was just an accident with debris left on a stove in an empty house. There is no case to investigate. \n\nThe landlord is working on an expedited eviction which will take several more weeks. Meanwhile, I don\u2019t feel my family and I are safe sleeping in our home, as it could burn down any night. \n\nIs there anything I can do?",

If the latter, you likely didn't talk to an officer at all but a dispatcher who clearly should be reprimanded.  I hate to say this, but having worked as a dispatcher for sometime, there are a lot of them who leave something to be desired and some who even have no place working in emergency services, or it's someone new/not trained enough who doesn't know what to do.\n\nIf you're 100% sure it was a cop you talked to though, call during business hours and ask to talk to someone higher up, like a lieutenant or  supervisory officer.  Also reach out to the sheriff's department - do not call their non-emergency number as they will likely route you back to your city's agency.  Ask to talk to the sheriff or undersheriff directly and ask for guidance.  \n\nMake SURE you elaborate to them that your neighbor was doing this knowing you were in the home in your shared building and that you feel extremely unsafe and in danger due to his actions.  Likewise, you can also call them and ask for the fire marshal's contact information, or the number for your local FD's chief.  They should definitely have those.  \n\nIf your neighbor does this again, call 911 immediately, even if you're not home, and as much as I hate to say it, embellish it as much as you can to get it through to the dispatcher that you, whoever lives in your home, your belongings, etc are in imminent peril because your neighbor is repeatedly trying to light your building on fire.",

Even if they are not acting law enforcement, they can light a fire under law enforcement's behind and can direct you to the correct law enforcement folks who will take this seriously. It's a [federal position](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/) and they do not fuck around. \n\n2. Call your homeowners insurance, the neighboring landlord's insurance, and the housing development's/subdivision's board's/council's/HOA's insurance. Any entities who would have to pay if there was damage. \n\n3. Call the neighboring landlord and send them a copy of the videos and other proof you have; they may be able to use that in court to expedite the eviction process even further. \n\n4. MAKE 10 COPIES OF ALL OF THE PROOF YOU HAVE, AND STORE THE ORIGINALS + TWO COPIES IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AT THE BANK. Photos and videos should be backed up in other places (including at least two cloud storage drives) and the at least 5 physical drives with photos and videos should be stored at your storage unit, with at least two different trusted and sympathetic friends, and two copies plus the originals in a safe deposit box at the bank, as well as two at your home - one to give to police or fire marshals and the other to retain for yourself. Having your home damaged is wildly expensive to fix; making 10 copies may seem excessive, but you'll be kicking yourself later if they get stolen from your storage unit (notoriously easy to break into) or one or both of your friends' places or lost in the inevitable fire or, or, or, or, or.  Too many possibilities for screwups here - just make 10 copies, and most importantly, keep two plus the originals in the bank's safe deposit (and only take one copy at a time out as needed).\n\n5. Physically go in to the police department AND the fire department for your area with copies of the proof and make a stink. Don't get arrested obviously, but your family is in danger here. Don't take this lying down; phone calls can be hung up and emails can be ignored.",

    "postText": "Hi Reddit. My girlfriend (20) and I (22) recently moved out of our apartment. For about a year we had one landlord, and for another year we had a different landlord. The neighbors told us that new carpets were put in for us when we moved in. We paid a $550 security deposit upon moving in, and a monthly rent of $575 plus $40 for our cat and dog. He told us at the time of moving in that since we already had the cat, that we would not need to pay a pet deposit, as the old landlord never requested such. As far as we knew, paying extra for the pets would cover any damages they would do to the unit. Our dog peed on the carpet, twice. He claims the \"pet smell\" was \"extremely strong\" in the apartment along with pet hair, apparently everywhere. We cleaned the carpets with a Rug Doctor that we rented from Dollar General, which we confirmed with him would be okay. We also bought pet specific soap to assist with the smell. We cleaned the carpets (which were extremely short), and then opened a window in the empty apartment to help the carpet dry, and to alleviate any remaining odor. We moved out on April 21st, cleaned the carpets April 24th, and signed our checkout papers on April 30th. We had a neighbor go into the apartment to see if the carpets were dry, and asked her if she had smelled anything while inside the apartment. She claims she couldn't smell any urine, but could tell we had pets in the apartment. (Obviously, it was a pet friendly apartment complex, five out of the six tenants currently living in the apartments had pets as well.) Landlord claimed there was still \"a little\" pet smell left during our checkout meeting, although my girlfriend, myself, my father and other neighbors can corroborate that there wasn't much of a smell, although a few others said there was a slight smell (not as bad as we believe the landlord is making it out to be). We thought we may have been nose blind, so we asked others. The new tenant that was moving into our apartment moved in not long after we had left (about a week) and says the pet smells, nor stains were fully removed. They had also mentioned an ammonia smell. We assumed this was from the ozone machine. There was still some pet hair around the wood trim in the corners of the rooms, according to the new tenant. We had vacuumed the spots where we saw dog hair, and went over the spots where the dog had peed with the carpet cleaner multiple times. Landlord claims he spent three days getting the dog hair and smell out of the carpet with powdered pet deodorizers and an ozone machine, which he owned and said he would rent to us anyways. He never hired a professional cleaner, neighbors claim they never saw/heard any heavy duty carpet cleaners, and said they only ever saw him use the ozone machine and the powder. It was just him and the woman who came monthly to clean the apartment lobby. (housekeeping, I guess.) She had also been told to go \\*back in\\* once she'd already been in to clean because it \"wasn't clean enough\". The landlord says this apartment was one of the hardest pet smells to get out, and would even have required a brand new carpet, if not for the new tenant moving in so soon. We believed it was as clean as the day we'd moved in when we left, and smelled nothing upon walking in to check out. He is making our situation seem much worse than we believe it is, and we want to know if there is anything that can legally be done to help us out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR landlord claims the pet odor was one of the worst he's seen, while apparently not hiring a professional to clean it, and wants to take our money for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if there's nothing we can do, anything helps. :)\n\nEdit: Two of the neighbors kept their doors open as to allow cats to wander the apartments. One of them on one occasion got stuck in or apartment, after we had moved everything out and been gone for multiple days . We believe he may have peed on the carpet, as that spot was not there before we left.\n\nAnother clarification: Is there potential for a case if we can show our landlord has a history of being unreasonable. I have many examples of him neglecting to take care of problems with the building.",

We lived there for a year with him as the landlord and in total paid an extra $480 to even have the pets. I just don't understand what the point of paying extra for pets is if it wouldn't be used for pet damages. Am I wrong about this as it is my first rental.",

If the amount of damage exceeds the deposit, you\u2019re responsible for it. \n\nAs far as your neighbors leaving their doors open and letting their cats out, that\u2019s your problem, not the landlord\u2019s. You\u2019re responsible for keeping your property secure and should\u2019ve kept your own door closed.",

We also asked both neighbors to keep their cats inside their apartment. We did not notice the cat enter and we were only made aware when we returned days later and the cat walked out. I guess what is the purpose of charging pet rent then if not to clean up the mess a pet makes.",

    "postText": "Hi y'all, I won't go into too much detail but I got an extremely aggressive letter from my father-in-law sent by his business lawyer that threatens all kinds of things and I'm wondering if I can show it to other people for feedback. It has flared my PTSD and caused a whole host of issues (we have left our family farm property due to this), and I know my FIL has told other people about the letter on his end due to people reaching out to us shocked. I've got family &amp; friends asking/concerned and I'd love them to read it so they know the situation. It's on such a level as my in-laws will never be in my or my children's life again due to the nature of the threats made. \n\nI would not be going into details with people I share the letter with as it speaks for itself... it's that bad. So I'm not worried about slander/libel issues of me talking about my FIL/the situation. \n\nGeneral thoughts? Can you get into trouble for sharing correspondence like that? I do have legal counsel lined up (state of GA) but due to finances and scheduling issues, it will be a few days and I'm in agony.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I've known this guy most of my life. He was in the US illegally and DACA did not cover him, so he left in 2013 (high school years) and hopped around a few countries, now lives in Canada. We've been close for a long time, but in the past year his mental health has sharply declined. Ever since he left, we'd communicate over text and Discord (text &amp; voice chat). We'd spend time each week or so playing games and messing around on Discord. Ever since he has had mental struggles, he doesn't seem to want to talk or play games anymore. I had been trying for years to present some options for him to improve his lifestyle but he refused to do anything. I tried texting him a couple months ago, but his responses were complete nonsense. I am not a doctor in the slightest but believe he is very unstable now. I know from his brother that he has destroyed most of his belongings during some kind of episode.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to today, and I receive a text from him that he is planning to sue for negligence and that \"fyi, your (my) name might come up a bunch.\" This caught me off guard and came out of nowhere. I asked if he is okay and for some context on what he is talking about.\n\nHe then said that I \"should be aware as everyone else\" who \"decided to give\" him \"the sick treatment.\" At this point I'm totally lost. My response read \"I really don't know what you're talking about and what is 'sick treatment?'\" His last text read, \"That's great, maybe you'll understand when I file a lawsuit.\"\n\nI am willing to provide any (non-personally identifiable) information on our relationship and history (his and ours as friends), because I genuinely have no idea what's going on. I am not sure of his mental state and he is by himself in Canada. Does anything he is saying have any legal ground? Should I consult a lawyer since I was threatened? I'm not sure if it's safe to assume that this is nothing..\n\nThank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

While I haven't done anything that I am aware of, it's hard for me to stay calm in situations like these, especially since I have had zero run-in with the law.\n\nI stopped answering his texts and will no longer contact him.",

Ignoring all the other excellent reasons, it's quite expensive to sue someone from another country.  Very few lawyers will take frivolous cases, and really not if there's no huge payday in it for them.\n\nYou have nothing to worry about.",

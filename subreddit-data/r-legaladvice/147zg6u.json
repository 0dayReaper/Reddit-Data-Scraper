    "postText": "(Florida) I bought my home in only my name four years ago. Two years ago I started dating my now ex and shortly after he moved in. My home is his legal residence with his driver's license and everything being this address. His 14 year old daughter also lives with us full time. He is physically and emotionally abusive including one DV arrest against me a month ago. The charges and the no contact order have been dropped since then. I have finally made the difficult decision to separate, but part of the reason it has taken so long is that I am unsure how to actually proceed with this. He has neither the desire nor the funds to leave the house and I do not have another place to go. How do I go about forcing him to leave in a legal manner? What are my options? He also owes me about $22,000 for other expenses of his while he was unemployed for basically a year. Realistically I think it will just end up being the stupid tax, but I had no other options. Any hope on recovering any of that will also be appreciated. Thanks.",

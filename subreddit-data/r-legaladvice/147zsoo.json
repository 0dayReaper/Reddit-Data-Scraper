    "postText": "So my sister and brother-in-law recently purchased a home in Missouri in the country. Their home has a well on their property and the two neighboring homes both share my sister's well. The previous agreement was that all three homes split the bill evenly (thirds) each month but my sister found out that one of the homes has been \"forgetting\" to pay the last three years. She doesn't care about the previous years and has spoken with that neighbor saying they can just start fresh but it's been a month and half so far and no payments. It's not too much money each month but still, is there anything my sister can do about it?",

My sister says one of their neighbors just drops a check in their mailbox each month but the other says that she \"always forgets\" (that's what the neighbor who owes the money says). \n\nIf it's only a verbal agreement, any idea what happens?",

How do they get the water? Pretend I don't know anything about wells. Is there a pipe with a shutoff valve?\n\nEven if it's written, did the written contract transfer with the home sale?\n\nShe may want to have a local real estate attorney review the paperwork and send a friendly demand letter to the family. The attorney will know how far sister can go. But she may want to (if possible) enter into a new contract.",

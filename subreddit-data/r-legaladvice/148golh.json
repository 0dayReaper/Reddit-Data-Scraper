We are in Pennsylvania.\n\nShe is still active and takes care of the house and yard, my kids and I visit on a weekly basis to lend a hand. \n\nWe have put all her accounts in both of out names. But I am not sure what to do with they her house.\n\nShe owns a nice little single home which she still lives in and plans to die there.\n\nI am an only child. \n\nIt was suggested that I get a new deed drawn up without my father name on it.  Possibly then put my name on it as well as hers.\n\nI am would like some suggestions on estate preparation.\n\nI looked back through reddit history but couldn't find a similar question. Sorry if this was answered somewhere else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Putting a kid's name on a deed is the single biggest estate planning boner that people commit, at least in the United States. Even without the Medicaid problem.\n\nFather's estate needs to be probated as well. His 2022 taxes filed and paid, etc. House out of his name.",

            "comment": "You should talk to an estate planning attorney.  Pennsylvania has an inheritance tax, and there are ways that you can reduce that tax if you plan ahead, and also ways to reduce the costs and nuisance of probate when your mom does eventually pass away.\n\nBeing named on her account is helpful so long as you don't have credit problems -- creditors will think that's all your money.   But, be aware that the bank is likely to cut off access to those accounts when she dies.\n\nYou should be aware that there are all sorts of criminals who prey on the elderly.   And there are even more shady people who find legal ways to separate the elderly from their money.  \\[The elderly are frequent marks for home shopping channels.\\]  It might be that you need to look through her credit card statements and bank accounts to make sure that nothing squirrely is going on.",

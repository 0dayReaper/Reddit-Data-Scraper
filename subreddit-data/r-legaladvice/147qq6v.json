    "postText": "I am having an unexpected issue getting a cashier's check to pay my first month and deposit on the day my lease begins.  They require payment in this manner as stipulated by the lease.\n\n\"If first month's rent is not payed when or before the Lease Contract begins, we may end your right of occupancy and recover damages, future rent, reletting charges, attorney's fees, court costs, and other lawful charges.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLosing the apartment would suck, but I am more concerned about this clause, especially the term \"future rent\".  Realistically, does this mean they can shut me out from the apartment, but still charge me for the entire year's rent if I do not pay by the day the lease begins?",

And their addition costs related to this default.  \n\nThis is a *bad* way to go.  You need to solve the issue getting your payment.",

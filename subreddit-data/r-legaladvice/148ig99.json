    "postText": "(State is Nevada) \nSo my grandma who adopted me and my sister passed away on April 20th and immediately our aunt and uncle took the will and read through it and have since been making excuses on why we can't see it, my brother is co-executor of the will alongside my aunt, the lawyer has not contacted us once since she passed even though he was hired to not only make the will and trust but to make sure it was being fulfilled the way my grandma wanted it to be, my aunt has since said that she can access the entire trust without my brother but this should not be possible unless she's made a claim that he's incapable, also she is trying to kick them out of the house so she can put the house in her sons name but my grandma always said the deed would be in the brothers name, we also found paperwork of my aunt filling to be my guardian (I'm the only minor at 17) so what I think this is means someone else was supposed to be my guardian but judging from the papers she pretended to be my grandma and got it changed to her, the lawyer has been almost impossible to get through but now he's saying we have to pay another lawyer 3000 dollars for help on this as he's \"swamped\" reviews on him state that he will do this every time, when we asked for a copy of the will he said only my brother could get a copy but shouldnt the entire family (close relatives) be able to get a copy?, also the night she died my aunt took out 1000 dollars from her account and did it again twice within the next 5 days. \n\nSorry for the bad format I'm still processing everything as it's been pretty terrible with all of this, I have currently moved in with my girlfriend and her family and they have been a huge help in this, I just need advice for our next step my brother and sister are terrified of betraying my aunt but from what I have seen this is illegal with multiple felonies, please if you can help us here that would be amazing, grandma always wanted to make sure we were taken care of after she passed but it's clear my aunt and uncle have different plans.",

            "comment": "You need to allow the family time to grieve because it may be a few weeks or months before they even decide to submit the will to court.\n\nIf and when the will is filed, IF you are named as a beneficiary in it, the executor is required by law to send all beneficiaries a copy of it.\n\nWhat you can do right now is to hire an attorney to write a letter on your behalf (you, your sister and your brother) to ask the aunt (assuming that she is trustee of the trust) for a copy of the trust.  If any of you are named beneficiaries in the trust, then you have the right to ask for a copy of the trust and any accounting reports.  It's better if the written request comes from your attorney, because if the request came from just you, the trustee might ignore the request.",

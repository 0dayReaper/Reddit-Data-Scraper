    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI recently received notice of a wage garnishment from my employer in the amount of $4003 . Without knowing the percentage they would be taken out I filled out a claim of exemption and stated they can withhold $50 from each pay period . Through my employers system I was able to see that they are only taking 4% of my wages . Did I screw myself ? Because now I received a hearing date and in the paperwork it states they would like 25% now which I definitely cannot afford . I\u2019m not sure if there is a mistake on their part but they stated that I claimed to spend $1000 on clothing a month and seems \u201cexcessive\u201d BUT I wrote  $100 not $1000. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s why they are now asking for 25% . \n I also have no idea what to take to this hearing or what to do ? \nShould I hire a lawyer ? \nIf this matters, I am the head of household for myself &amp; my daughter . I receive no child support or any kind of support from anyone else . \n\nAny advice is helpful, thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "25% is the maximum that federal law allows for garnishment. Of course they would want as much as possible. If that place is an undue burden on you, then the judge can modify it at their discretion. You\u2019ll have to explain why that is not practical to the judge at the hearing. You might also let them (and the judge) know that they misread the amount you spend on clothing by increasing it 10x (100 to 1000).\n\nHaving a lawyer at this point would be very helpful, yes.",

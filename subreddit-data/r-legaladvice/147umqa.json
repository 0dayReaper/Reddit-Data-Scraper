    "postText": "We picked up the keys to our new apartment yesterday, and it was a mess. The last tenants had clearly trashed it, and the cleaning service this complex uses had only done a surface level job.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- The baseboards had been chewed up by some animal and there were scratches in the floor\n\n- The showers were absolutely filthy - the caulking had dirt caked onto it and hadn't been cleaned and the surfaces were disgusting.\n\n- The drain in the sink was rusted and corroded\n\n- Both bathroom sink drains were stuck and wouldn't open\n\nAnd then some smaller issues - paint drops all over the floor from sloppy painting, there were still grease marks on the kitchen ceiling, the blinds hadn't been dusted, the clean job on the floors was very poor and it still felt extremely dusty and dirty. \n\nThe assistant property manager who moved us in was very apologetic, and brought over a maintenance guy to start cataloguing the issues and getting them fixed, but they really just completely failed to do any sort of in-depth walkthrough - this apartment was just not ready to hand over to a new tenant.\n\nThey say they're going to fix a lot of the simple issues today (sinks, etc) and get cleaners in (hopefully). However, the shower and bathtub need to be completely resurfaced, and they can't get the company in for two weeks. We also can't be in the house or have our pets there for it, so I'm not sure what we're going to do that day (move our cats back to the old place for a day?)\n\nWe still have our lease on the old place for a few more weeks, but we already had movers scheduled for tomorrow. I'm trying to see if we can reschedule the movers, but it would probably incur a fee and we already scheduled things like the internet change, so staying at the old place isn't a fantastic option.\n\nWhat can I ask for here? Obviously, they need to fix all these ASAP. The assistant manager was making it sound like she couldn't give us any discount on rent, but I'm going to try again with the property manager assuming they might have more power to do that (but it's a national company, so probably not).",

    "postText": "A few days ago I got a call from a loved one's phone number, from a person demanding money claiming to have my loved one at gunpoint.  As it turned out it was caller ID spoofing and everyone was fine.  But I was panicked at first and went to verify everyone was ok before hanging up the phone.  Then I called the police and they said it's a common scam and there was never any real danger and the call probably originated from overseas so they won't look into it.  Well I called my phone provider, and they said it looked like the call originated from the local area, it did not come in from another state or country.  I called the police again with this information, and they told me since I didn't give them any money, no law had been violated. They said threatening to kill me could be a terroristic threat, but threatening to kill loved ones is not.  \n\nIs there any way I can get this looked into?  I don't see how the threat wasn't credible at the time, it appeared to be a call from the claimed victims phone, and I had no way of knowing it wasn't.  At best it's a horrific scam and I guarantee I'm not the only victim, at worst it really is someone local who knows me and that's why they have so much of my information.  I just want to verify the origin of the threats and that there is no actual danger, it seems like the police could request that information from the phone company and are just refusing to do it.",

This is extremely low priority for the police and since you didn't fall for the scam, it's really not worth it for them to subpoena information and try to track down someone who was probably using a burner phone and will never be identified. This is an extremely common scam.",

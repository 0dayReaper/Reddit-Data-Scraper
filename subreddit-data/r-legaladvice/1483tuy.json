    "postText": "I'm a uni student and someone scraped the front of my car around two months ago and left a note on the windshield admitting fault and gave his name and number. Upon contacting him, he admit fault over text and asked to pay without insurance and I agreed. After sending him a \\~$1,500 quote from the autobody, he agreed to pay it but has stopped responding for the past two weeks after multiple follow-ups. I have pictures of the car, the note, and his texts. Is the next step to file a hit-and-run or has too much time passed to do anything?",

    "postText": "Today I was riding my electric scooter through my city. I was on the sidewalk using eco mode (very slow acceleration to preserve battery power) (no pedestrians on the sidewalk). I saw that the traffic light facing me was green (meaning I had the right away to cross). Along with that I noticed a truck (think medium sized uhaul size) was waiting at the light. (He was on my left side waiting for his light to turn green) as I accelerated onto the cross walk the driver began to quickly turn right on the red. I\u2019m doing this he managed to totally not see me. He accelerated right into me. The trucks driver side front impacted my entire left side (mind you I\u2019m only wearing regular clothes) and I am Thrown off my electric scooter and into the intersection. I\u2019m not sure if I lost consciousness but I cannot remember my fall (kinda blacked out) I only remember about 10 seconds later after I stood up. My entire left side was numb I received his company\u2019s contacts including the owner of the business. I limped to the ER which conveniently was 4 walking mins away. After 7 hours the scans found nothing but deep bruising to my left side of my body. Im now in extreme pain and in a neck brace for support. Any legal guidance or tips! Im a college student literally just trying to save gas money LMFAOO so this is new and a shock To me.\n\n\nIn our city, Ive talked with police officers  about riding on the sidewalk. I am legally permitted to ride my motorized scooter on public sidewalks. But again to reiterate, he was at a red light. My light was green. \n\nI was headed north. He was headed East. Meaning the direction I was headed leaves the two roads at an intersection. Both being two lanes, in both directions. One road with one lane going eastbound parallel to the westbound traffic. And one road with two lanes, one headed northbound with southbound parallel. If I headed north and crossed the intersection and they made a right turn on red on the east to west road. Turning onto the southbound lane We absolutely can cross paths. Which means we both have a traffic light we must follow. His was red, mine green. This is a city/suburban intersection. Not a highway, freeway, Blvd, avenue etc this is an average car centric American road. \n\nIf I had been walking, he would have just ran me over. The fact I was on a scooter and accelerating (around 8 mph) I was hit by his driver side. If I had gone any slower I would\u2019ve ended up underneath the truck.\n\nPlease read this before replying. Like actually thoroughly consider the specified parentheses.\n\nSimple summary: I left the sidewalk when my light was green, as soon as I entered the crosswalk, the truck driver accelerated to make a right turn, his traffic light was red. He hit me.",

            "comment": "On an electric scooter, you are typically considered a vehicle, and have to follow all rules of the road, similar to a bike. As such, you should not have been on the sidewalk, and are not entitled to use the cross walk. If the car was making a right on red, that means that you (as a through traffic vehicle), should have stopped for the light.",

I had the right to cross the street. My light was green. I\u2019m not sure if you drive but when your light turns green you begin to move your vehicle. If you cross a street you wait till you are signaled and it is safe to cross.

It sounds like a true accident.\n\n&gt;I cannot remember my fall \n\nSuper-common with trauma injuries, especially if you hit your head and were concussed.   I'm a big fan of Pro-Tec skater helmets for scooter use.\n\n&gt;I received his company's contacts including the owner of the business\n\nYou should make a 3rd party claim on their auto insurance for your ER costs, and ongoing medical costs.   They will likely add a little money for your pain and suffering, in exchange for a quick agreement to settle the claim.",

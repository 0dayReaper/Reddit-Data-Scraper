    "postText": "Hi, I live in the U.K and have recently been put through my excavator and dumper course. I\u2019m looking at leaving due to the way I get treated here, but I want to know what rights I have in terms of having to pay back the course prices! I\u2019ve never signed anything to say I need to and it\u2019s not in my contract to my knowledge. Is this something I can argue with or? Any help would be appreciated! \n\nThank you",

NAL, but you are probably not liable for the cost of the courses or any training provided at work unless you explicitly agreed to this liability. \n2. If you have documented reasons for leaving the job due to maltreatment you may be able to argue that your leaving was outside your control.\n\ni recommend you Contact ACAS for free legal advice for UK employees.",

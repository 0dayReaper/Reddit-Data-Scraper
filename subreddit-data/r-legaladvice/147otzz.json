    "postText": "I\u2019m from Colorado and i just recently found out that there is a house next door to my child\u2019s daycare, that has a camera overlooking the playground. \nI\u2019m not okay with strangers recording my child without my consent. Is there any legal action I can take to have him take down the camera?\n\nI would be okay if the daycare had the cameras just not some stranger. I\u2019ve also spoken to the director and the teachers at the daycare and they were not aware of the camera\u2019s either. The director was upset. Maybe I\u2019m overreacting, but in my opinion this is creepy.",

            "comment": "A little bit turns here on what \"overlooking\" means.  If this person is surveilling their own property and the daycare's playground is in the background there's absolutely no problem here.  And, depending on the nature of the daycare and the situation, this person may be wise to have video footage of whatever is crossing over into his property.  \n\nIf this camera is positioned directly and deliberately to view the playground I agree it may be creepy (still I might suspect this person was managing some concern with neighboring a daycare rather than leaping to something like pedophilia). You're always free to report things that concern you to the police.  But even in that case it isn't really clear there's something for police to do.",

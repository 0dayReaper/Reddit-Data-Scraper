    "postText": "I had recently changed phone numbers and hadn't had the chance to switch the number associated with my Microsoft account (Xbox included) and the person who received my old number signed into my account and signed up a new email with it. My old email is still in use but as a back up I guess? I was able to see the whole email that was being used but not able to sign in with my email. I've checked the help portion of Microsoft and it leads to dead ends. I even made anew account to check if I could get in contact with a real person. No such luck.. I even contacted support through phone and they said to call 1800 Microsoft and hung up. I had just called the 1-800 number... Is there anyway to get my account and Minecraft back?",

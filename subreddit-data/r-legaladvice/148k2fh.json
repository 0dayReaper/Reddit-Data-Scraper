    "postText": "Like the title asks, is there any way to remove a tenant from a lease if they are doing drugs in the house? My friend signed a lease with another person who is now spending extended amounts of time out of the house but when they return they are obviously strung out on some hard drugs, and we\u2019re not talking pot. She stays at the house a few days, awake the whole time and then leaves again. Is there anything my friend can do in this situation? Any suggestions or ideas welcome! Thanks in advance!",

I wonder if your friend could do something similar to entice this roommate to leave and sublet (assuming subletting is allowed under your lease and you can find a suitable replacement tenant).",

    "postText": "To give you context of the situation, my professor failed my final exam which would result in me having to re-enrol in the course next semester and paying a hefty fee. He thinks I cheated, although he gave me very little information. I sent out an appeal, proving the legitimacy of my work, and carefully explaining it as well. Logically and ethically, it should be enough to absolve me of his accusations, but this had happened to a friend of mine in a different class and her appeal got dismissed so quickly and is left to re-enrol. I personally would not want to accept that because I genuinely know I did not cheat. I am determined to appeal and resolve this. In the off chance the university rejects my appeal and tells me I will fail, should I call a lawyer? Should I sue? Any suggestions would help as I am genuinely stressed and worried. Thank you",

If you think it's proof and they think it isn't, they're, in this context, entitled to their conclusion.\n\nAnd you didn't *prove* that you didn't cheat.  That is a logical and practical impossibility.",

Find the process for your school and read it over thoroughly so that you full understand it and your options. At my current school and the schools I attended, there were multiple layers of appeals possible. Many institutions also have an ombudsman or an office dedicated to helping students that be able to help guide you through the situation.\n\nHiring a lawyer, trying to sue your professor is way out of what is considered normal and would is thus a nuclear option. Don't think of going there until you have exhausted all of your other options.",

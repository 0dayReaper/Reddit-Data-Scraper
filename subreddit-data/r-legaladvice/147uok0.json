    "postText": "Essentially I\u2019m an absolute moron and didn\u2019t think about my consequences. I forged roughly 18 checks all adding up to around $7200 and deposited them through mobile instant deposit(this was over the course of a few months) and some change. Bank pretty much overdrafted me for this amount and now I owe that much(they closed my account). I do regret it but its too late for that now, I am a minor(17) and I\u2019ve told my parents about everything, they definitely aren\u2019t too happy. I want to go to the bank and own up to it and face any charges that may come my way but wanted advice before doing so. The jail time isn\u2019t really something that worries me, I think it\u2019s probably the best outcome to keep me out of trouble and make me fully understand how stupid I was. I of course dont have $7200 laying around, unless I was to sell all off my stuff but I\u2019m not fully against the going to jail part. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated, can\u2019t even really say this was a mistake because 18 times is absurd, it was stupid and I\u2019m fully willing to bare the consequences.\n\nIm curious on what time I\u2019d be facing, what charges, would it be juvie or what,etc.\n\n(USA)",

You need a defence attorney now, if you cannot afford one the court will provide a public defender. You need one to advocate for you so this mistake doesn't ruin your life, only discuss the case with them.\n\nUntil then do not discuss the case with anyone and if interrogated by the police politely ask to see your attorney if you have one or ask for a public defender then refuse to answer any further questions.",

I pretty much begged my parents to allow me to take the responsibility of facing the consequences but they insisted on helping me. Im paying 50% and my step-dad will pay 50% but I had to box him and get the shit beat out of me in order for that to work out.\n\nFair to say I've learned my lesson.",

    "postText": "I am developing a website for a young entrepreneur and instead of him paying me for my work, we have verbally agreed to a 70/30 partnership split. He sent me a partnership agreement to review and sign but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s more prudent to do this through my LLC (if that\u2019s even a thing or it makes the partnership at totally different thing) or as myself. \n\nMy thought is that, if nothing else, taking any profits through the partnership under the LLC allows me to reduce my personal taxable income, among other things?\n\nShould I redline the agreement and replace my name with my LLC?",

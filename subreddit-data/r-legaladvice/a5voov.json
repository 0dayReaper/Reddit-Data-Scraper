    "postText": "Hi all! So I put a gaming comp on layaway with Walmart a few weeks ago so I could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. \n\nI finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. So I returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as I was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a Walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. \n\nWell it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. \n\nWe did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn\u2019t good enough?? She said that it had a \u201cdifferent balance\u201d on all the receipts but that\u2019s because it was layaway and I made payments! \n\nShe told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? \n\nI\u2019m totally distraught, I\u2019m a college student and I don\u2019t have extra funds this was something I worked hard for. \n\nAny and all advice is welcome I\u2019m desperate. I am in the US, specifically Florida\n\nEDIT: I understand now, Walmart was not the best place to buy the PC, I get it. The reason I did was so I could make payments the way I wanted. Hindsight is 20/20 ",

There is absolutely no reason why this can't be resolved. Continue being persistent and firm with your demands and explain that the customer service provided to you was abysmal. Can I guarantee this will work? Unfortunately, no. Not all Walmarts suck. It really depends on the management at each store.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can ask the corporate customer service for the contact info for the regional manager of that area. Usually those managers have more of an incentive to fix major issues at the stores they help manage.",

You need to call back and escalate to a supervisor. Front line customer service sometimes does not have the full authority (or knowledge) to help you. Keep escalating and asking for the persons supervisor until you get someone who realizes it was on layaway and therefore there are multiple payments they have to add up. ",

I would ask for their name as soon as they answer, and then ask for their supervisor. If they hang up, call again and repeat the process. It's impossible they would all hang up on you when you ask, and when someone finally does pass you along you'll have a nice list of all the assholes you need to get in trouble. \n\n\n\n\nIf you're honestly not getting help through calling, go to the same store you had the layaway in person and ask for the manager there. Then, don't leave until they've resolved it. You have the receipt proof which is the only thing they need. They need to figure it out, if they say they can't help ask for the supervisors manager. Take it to the stores' GM if you have to. \n\n\n\nThis is one of those cases where the squeaky wheel gets the grease. ",

All the registers keep a record of payments and since yours was foe a layaway item I would think their would be an account name of some sort attached to it.

So I put a gaming comp on layaway with Walmart a few weeks ago so I could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. \n&gt; \n&gt; I finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. So I returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as I was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a Walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. \n&gt; \n&gt; We did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn\u2019t good enough?? She said that it had a \u201cdifferent balance\u201d on all the receipts but that\u2019s because it was layaway and I made payments! \n&gt; \n&gt; She told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? \n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m totally distraught, I\u2019m a college student and I don\u2019t have extra funds this was something I worked hard for. \n&gt; \n&gt; Any and all advice is welcome I\u2019m desperate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

It can take some time, but generally they will contact someone within the corporate office and bypass local store staff who don\u2019t want to deal with it. Depending on where you live there could be state agencies that also govern that type of thing, so contacting your local representatives for assistance can also be beneficial. ",

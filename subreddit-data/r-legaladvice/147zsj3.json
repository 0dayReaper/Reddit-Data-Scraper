    "postText": "House is owned by 2 family members. In indiana. One could not finance it on their own so the other family helped them finance it by being a co-borrower. Deed is in both names as Joint tenants w right of survivorship. \n\nThe one who lives in the home let the home go into foreclosure, a default judgment was entered and it\u2019s scheduled for sherif sale. The one who lives in the home makes little income and probably can\u2019t afford a repayment plan but has almost no debt besides the home. The one who doesn\u2019t live in the home has plenty of income and assets. \n\nIn order to stop the foreclosure do both parties have to file ch 13 bankruptcy since the foreclosure judgment is on both of them? Or would just one party be enough to stop the sherif sale? If so which party should file?",

            "comment": "&gt;If so which party should file?\n\nYou absolutely need to speak with a bankruptcy attorney. It isn't a given that the one who doesn't live at the home even qualifies for a Chapter 13 (because they have \"plenty of income\"). \n\nIs there a reason the one with the money doesn't just get the home out of foreclosure/breach and go from there? Why would they want to file bankruptcy if it just delayed the inevitable?",

And I can\u2019t speculate on their thinking or reasons for delaying the inevitable. \n\nMostly I just want to know if a situation like this requires both parties to file bankruptcy to stop the sherif sale since the foreclosure judgement is against BOTH parties.

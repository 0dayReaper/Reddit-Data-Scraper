    "postText": "Basis of this claim - \nI parked my car in a private paid Mammoth Lakes parking lot, I took a photo of my car where I parked to show the lot attendant to make sure it was an acceptable spot, to which he replied, yes. \nI walked back to my car to get my things and saw there was a large wheel loader (construction equipment) plowing ice on the hill behind my car. It looked like it could be concerning but I trusted that they were professional and things would be ok, but I still took a photo of them in the process of moving ice near my car.\n\nI returned 36 hours later to see that the wheel loader had continued to move a lot of ice and shoved a huge pile of it on my car, crushing the roof, hood, rear spoiler, side mirrors, etc. (I later had this quoted by a bodyshop for $6,300).\nI got the lot attendant to show him the damage, he was very nice and acknowledged the damage, he took photos, gave me his number, his supervisor's name/number/email, and the contact info for the sub contractor that does the snow removal.\n\nUnfortunately I found that somehow I did not have comprehensive insurance on this car, my other 3 vehicles do, but somehow it was missing from my policy from the beginning for this one.\n\nAfter many attempts to contact the snow removal company they answered and were dismissive of the claim and said I had no video evidence and that they will not submit a claim with their insurance company. \n\nI then pursued the lot management company\u2019s insurance company, they denied the claim stating that there is no evidence that my car wasn't already smashed before there was hundreds of pounds of ice on my car (despite the before photos). \n\nAt this point it looks like I am just left to go the small claims route. I have photos of my car an hour before I parked, right after I parked, while the wheel loader was working next to it, and many photos of my car with ice on it, and the damages after I moved the car away from the ice.\n\nQuestions:\nWho should I sue? General contractor (lot management company), Sub contractor (snow removal company hired by lot management company), insurance companies for general or subcontractor, or everyone? \n\nShould I get quotes from multiple body shops? The damage is extensive enough that it may total the car based on how an insurance company values the car, so I don't know how that would work in a ruling. \n\nWould I file this in the city where the damage occured, or the city in which the management company is based?\n\nWith the evidence I have, does this case seem in my favor?\n\nIf I do win, will collections be somewhat easy because every company involved is quite large and established?",

You don't need a video of them doing it.  That's just their insurance company trying not to pay a claim and hoping you'll go away.\n\nCollections should be easy -- the insurance company should cut you the check.",

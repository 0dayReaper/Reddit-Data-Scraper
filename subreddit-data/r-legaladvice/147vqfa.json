    "postText": "I will start by saying that i am Muslim from Egypt, \ni am 19 and living in turkey with my mother for over 6 years legally under residence permission and from time to time i visit Egypt to see my family back there too.\n\n3 years ago i met a girl she was a year younger than me and she was from the US, we got along and eventually it got serious then we started dating and we had serious plans that were in the work to live with each other \neverything was fine until a few months ago.\n\nHer mother was worried if I was a bad person or a fake person and i completely understand that and me being very confident in my innocence i send my ex a picture of my passport and a picture of my  residence permission card in turkey.\n\nAnd she showed those 2 pictures to someone in her family that's of a really high rank in the military.\n\nAnd that person they said that they \"found out\"\nthat i am in a terrorist group. Apparently.\n\nAnd from there her mother started getting paranoid and eventually forced us to stop talking to each other. \n\nMy ex knows i am innocent but her mom is not so sure and doesn't want to take the risk and for the person in her family claiming i am a terrorist is ethier just lying or found misinformation\n\nI just want to prove my innocence and make everything go back to normal but i don't know how please help..",

There's no legal discourse to this people are allowed to be racist, you may be able to sue the military guy for defamation or libel if it was posted somewhere. But if she isn't going to fight for you then just go your own way.",

    "postText": "Coworker accessed my phone without permission, looked at my bank account, credit scores, ring camera inside my apartment, social media, dating apps, social media, text messages, pictures, emails, everything. They also accessed my emails and accounts on a work computer. They claim I gave them my passwords but I didnt. They are now using some of the information they found without my permission to harass me. Specifically harassing me about being gay (I'm not), broke, lonely, and telling me details about the inside of my home that they found on my ring camera. They claim to have found videos of me naked on my cameras. What kind of suits would this pertain to?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the concern and advice. I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n1.  This coworker claims I gave him my password, which I was using for almost every account I have (Dumb, I know), which is how he accessed everything on my phone and the computer. He also somehow found out the password to my work email to access everything on there as well. I did not give my passwords.\n\n2. There is no written or recorded evidence yet, but he admitted all of this to me and several coworkers. He also claimed he spread some of the information and media he found to other people at work. There are several witnesses.\n\n3. All of the harassment has occurred at work. Again, multiple people have witnessed this.\n\n4. He claims that he did all this to get me to quit.",

            "comment": "First:  this is not just an HR matter but a criminal invasion of privacy and harassment issue, which makes it a police issue. You need to go to HR and tell them what has happened, and also explain you\u2019ll be filing a police report and potentially pressing charges. \n\nSecond, and you **need** to address this: how does this happen? Are you leaving your phone somewhere? If so, why? I almost never walk away from my phone and leave it somewhere, even if it\u2019s locked. People steal stuff all the time. You mention that they may have seen you put your passwords in: how? The passcode I can see if someone glances over your shoulder when you\u2019re putting it in, seeing as it\u2019s numeric and only 6 digits. As a banker I warn my clients about putting their passcode in while in public when prying eyes could see. Like don\u2019t do it while you\u2019re walking through a crowded bar. But how does someone see a password you\u2019re inputting unless they\u2019re standing over your shoulder? If you have an iPhone, are you using the keychain? If not, you should be. Using faceID, It inputs your passwords using facial recognition, and protects all your passwords by automatically storing them and only you can see them when it recognizes your face. I want to point out that I\u2019m not trying to victim blame here, but you have to take some responsibility, and then learn from this so it can\u2019t happen again. There are numerous safety and privacy tools at your disposal for a smartphone in 2023, and I can\u2019t wrap my head around how this would\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d been using them, outside having the phone wirelessly hacked. \n\nThird: all, and I mean **all** your passwords and passcodes need to be changed. You\u2019re also going to need to inform your bank that your online banking information has been compromised, and you\u2019ll need new credentials. And while I\u2019m not super tech savvy, it sounds like you\u2019re going to need to get a new phone as well. If this person has been in all these apps and has seen all your personal info, what\u2019s to say they haven\u2019t put something in the phone, or copied the phones IP address to get in remotely. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to get a screenshot of the settings menu with the phones IP address, and just text it to themselves, then delete that text message. If you gave me an unlocked phone, I could send myself a screenshot of the phones most sensitive information and leave no trace of doing it in under 30 seconds. \n\nLastly, I\u2019m not an attorney, but this doesn\u2019t sound like a civil matter, *yet*. You have to alert your job\u2019s HR dept that this is happening, and again inform them that you\u2019ll be involving the police. And then involve the police. Don\u2019t let your job convince you that you don\u2019t need to go to the cops for whatever reason. Just firing this person isn\u2019t going to solve this. It becomes a civil matter if they(your job) do nothing about it once you\u2019ve brought it to their attention. \n\nI wish you the best of luck, and if you need any additional help with how to safeguard your info, please Lmk.",

I don't normally recommend biometrics but in your case I would consider using fingerprint unlock or whatever other biometrics are available based on your smartphone.\n\nChange your password to the Apple ID/Google account associated with your phone.  Make sure you log the account out of all other devices to make sure your coworker does not maintain persistent access.  There's been a big thing about how you can lock someone out of their Apple account with only their phone passcode, don't know if you have an iPhone.  Set up MFA (multifactor authentication) for that Google/iOS account, ideally not through emails or text messages, but with an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy or using a hardware token like a Yubikey.\n\nOn a personal computer (not a work computer!) go into your main email account.  Log off all other sessions.  Check for forwarding rules and backup accounts to make sure this coworker didn't give themselves further access.  Change your password and set up MFA, ideally an authenticator like Google Authenticator/Authy or even get a Yubikey.\n\nYou said below your work email and personal emails are linked.  Unlink those.\n\nChange the passwords on your Ring/Amazon account and again set up MFA.\n\nSet up a password manager.  BitWarden is pretty popular.  Make sure it has MFA set up, again with an authenticator app or hardware token.  Go change all of your account passwords.  Start with bank accounts and social media.\n\nMake sure never to access personal stuff on a work computer, especially a shared work computer.  Log out of all your personal accounts on that work computer, honestly I would recommend clearing your cache on the browsers you use.  Again, don't access personal stuff and make sure your work email is not attached to your personal email.",

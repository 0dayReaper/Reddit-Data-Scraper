    "postText": "My lease required that I do a walkthrough with a property manager on the day I moved in and fill out a move-in inspection form.I signed the form, so did the PM, and they took it. Haven't thought about it for almost a year. There were a few issues noted in the form that maintanence never came and fixed, even though they were supposed to. Of note, the lease also states that they are obligated to give me a copy of the form if I request it.\n\nWell, I'm moving soon and I requested a copy of the form to make sure I fix any problems. They say they don't have it, despite the PM taking it and presumably filing it. If it had never been returned they would have said something but it's never been mentioned.\n\nI'm worried that they will try to claim the damages against my security deposit, and \"lost\" the form intentionally. What are my options here? I have photos of the damage but not of the form itself. No record of them receiving the form either. I am in NY state.",

Fentanyl addict who was once part of corporate America and has never known accountability for even a second has assault charges against him for his ex-girlfriend\u2019s current boyfriend.\n\nOver text, he fully confessed to \u201cputting a shotgun in his mouth\u201d and hitting him with his car.\n\nAs far as I know, he has not told anyone else this information and I think this man is a dangerous sociopath.\n\nTo keep my emotions out of it, I simply don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve never been involved in any criminal activity of any kind and I have no idea what I should do with this information.",

    "postText": "Hi! \nI\u2019m gonna make this super short and sweet but I sold a 300$ item on mercari and recorded myself packing it up and taping it up. The bubble mailer I used was covered in identifiable stickers and when the buyer received the package she instantly requested to return it claiming I didn\u2019t send the correct item. When I received the item back it was a plush keychain of a Pok\u00e9mon character. I opened a new claim with mercari and they said since what I received is what the buyer claims I sent, they had all the information they needed and ruled in favor of the buyer. I had kept asking where I could send my video proof to show that I did indeed send the right item and they basically told me tough luck and they already made their decision. Is there any legal action I can take against mercari or the buyer since what she did is a federal offense? How do I proceed going further as mercari doesn\u2019t seem like they will help me at all even though they claim to have a buyer/seller protection.",

Recording yourself packing up an object doesn't prove the buyer received that object in the end. Your recourse is to sue the buyer, in the buyers location, for $300",

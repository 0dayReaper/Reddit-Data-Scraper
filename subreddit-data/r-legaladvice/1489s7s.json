    "postText": "I recently used a third party comparison company Parcel2Go to source the best value parcel delivery for a domestic package for a table top I was returning to a supplier. I put the dimensions in, it was collected and I paid about \u00a352 for the product to be shipped via ParcelForce. The product arrived however two days later I received an email for P2G with a charge from the courier for an amount of an additional \u00a3103 due to the item being a few centimetres out on the measurements despite the weight being accurate.\n\nI called the actual courier ParcelForce directly and they say there is no charge they can see on their end, and they also say they wouldn\u2019t deliver if there were outstanding charges. However P2G are insisting that the charge is legitimate and that they would have received toe invoice later, hence why I was not informed until after delivery.\n\nI cannot afford this extra charge, and the total cost of delivery now exceeds the entire value of the returned product. I was not consulted, this delivery took place with additional charges required that hadn\u2019t been authorised and now I am being harassed to pay triple the original cost. Is this even legal? What options do I have besides to pay for something I didn\u2019t agree to?",

Anyone can input any information online for a shipment and pay based on those dimensions. Generally what happens is the package gets weighed several times while in transit at different facilities to ensure all the information is correct into what the customer imputed for dimensions and weight. It's not uncommon for the wrong information to be entered into systems by a customer - either because the customer just estimates the size and weight of the package or because they are trying to defraud the company. Before the final delivery, the company will weigh and measure the package and note the actual size and weight in the system to charge the customer accordingly.\n\nNow you say that you were a few centimeters off on your dimensions. That can make all the difference in terms of cost. Packages mostly get loaded and unloaded from trucks via conveyors and most companies have maximum dimensions and weights that they allow packages to move via conveyors - if the box is over that weight or dimensions, it's going to be loaded and unloaded and sorted by hand and that will be charged accordingly.",

                                    "comment": "Makes sense, but in this case the length of the product (which, when shipped to me was listed as 180cm including the box) when I returned it, they said it was 190cm. I am willing to pay a surcharge for this, but given that the original shipment of 180cm length is \u00a352, I fail to see why 10cm increase results in a price that ends up being triple the original cost. My argument is that this is disproportionate charge for the discrepancy and looks to me like legal scalping",

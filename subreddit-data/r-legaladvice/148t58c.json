    "postText": "We were renting a unit from a property manager in California. We returned the keys to the office's drop-off box on an agreed date, which fell on a Friday. The PM is claiming that they received the keys to our rental on Monday instead, and have wrongfully deducted 2 days of rent from our security deposit. We have not cashed the returned check yet, as we don't agree on the returned amount.\n\nWe have documentation of us physically dropping the envelope into the drop-off box on the agreed date and have sent it over to the PM contact in hopes that they will realize they are wrong. The video includes my watch with the time/date, the PM's address on the front door, and me physically dropping the envelope into the slot. Regardless, they doubled down and said that they did not receive our keys until that Monday.\n\nWhat should my next steps be to get the PM to return the deducted rental days back from our security deposit? Clearly, the video evidence is not sufficient enough to make them realize there might have been an error in handling on their end.",

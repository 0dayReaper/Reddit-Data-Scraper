I now routinely collect video evidence and witness statements anytime our 4 year old son so much as falls and skins his knee. \nOn the last visit one of the officers flat out asked me \u201cis she using us to harass you?\u201d to which I replied affirmative. \n\nIt gotten so bad I\u2019ve lost clients (my business deals with kids) and I\u2019m taking time away from work to deal with the stress, can I sue her for emotional distress and harassment?",

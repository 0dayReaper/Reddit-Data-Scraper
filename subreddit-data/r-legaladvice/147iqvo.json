    "postText": "Rarely are deliveries less than 2 miles, large majority are 3-5 miles, so 6-10 round trip. Undeniably the drivers are making less than legal mileage.\n\nAlso, I was curious if they're able to require employees to take a lunch if our shift exceeds 5 hours by any amount. They began doing this as well and are hard enforcing it, threatening us with write ups. It's unreasonable, as any closing shift close to 5 hours will be impossible to predict how busy it'll be and how long we'll need to stay.\n\nMy final question is if they're allowed to require us to take a lunch within the last hour of our shift. I really don't want to feel like I'm being held hostage to waste my time staying at work to abide to their rules.\n\nThis post was brought to you by the 4.5 hour delivery closing shift gang.",

    "postText": "I just received a ticket for unsafe lane change. The CHP officer also told me that my windows were to tinted and I was speeding while I was changing lanes, but he said he's gonna let me go easy and only give me an unsafe lane change ticket. Why did he still put the codes of the tint violation and speeding in the fourth box on the bottom?",

The DA can use this information in determining what they will offer. In my state there is a place where they will write the actual speed even if they charge a lower speed, same idea.",

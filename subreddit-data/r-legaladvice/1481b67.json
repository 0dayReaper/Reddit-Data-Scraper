I am guessing there isn\u2019t much that can be done here but thought I\u2019d ask. \n\nLast year some stupid things happened between my brother, his girlfriend, and her grandparents (in Missouri). Without giving away too many details to be identifiable\u2026 long story short - my brother had to physically defend himself and came out on the other end with probation and a felony.  \n\nHe has requested his belongings back from his now ex. He has also requested she give our grandfather\u2019s rifles over to me because he cannot have them anymore at this time due to his court orders. She refuses to give him his possessions and refuses to give our grandfather\u2019s guns over to me. She states the judge told her she can keep them. My parents were at every court hearing and this did not happen. \n\nWe would like our grandfather\u2019s possessions returned to the family where they will be safe and my brother needs his personal items back. For the guns: we do not have any intentions of giving them to my brother because we do not support violating laws. I work in a government role and abide by all laws so these will remain in my possession indefinitely. Regardless they belonged to my grandfather. He would want them to stay with one of his grandchildren and my brother chose me because I lived with my grandfather and took care of him until he passed away. \n\nTherefore, I need to know how best to go about getting my brothers belongings back and the guns placed into my care. My brother is afraid to take her to court because they do share children together and she\u2019s already made threats to keep them away. So I have been asked to help. Any advice?",

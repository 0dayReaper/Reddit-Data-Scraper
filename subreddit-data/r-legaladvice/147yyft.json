    "postText": "Hi reddit! \n\nI'm gonna try to make a long story short because I am lost and don't know what else to do. Basically, my partner and I applied for an apartment and sent all matching paystubs, bank statements, and matching checks. We make over 3x the rent and they said he was good on his part but my paystubs were the issue. They are using snappt, which is a third party verification service and it doesn't accept scans. My employeer scanned my pay stubs and I sent them to the leasing office. Everything was good until they noticed the \"year-to-date\" portion didn't update on my last 6 checks. The owner of the business I work for called and verified my employment for 3 years and explained our paystub system updates quartlerly. The apartment complex didn't care, took our $470 application fee, and cancelled our application. \n\nI have emailed my employer asking him to call the payroll company to try and resolve this issue and haven't heard back. Nearly every apartment complex in my area has begun using this verification system and I am stuck. I have worked for this business for 3 years and have been a loyal employee. I'm nervous I won't be able to find a place with these paystubs and it sucks because it is all 100% real and we make enough money to pay. The whole situation is disheartening and any advice would be appreciated. \n\nTIA! ",

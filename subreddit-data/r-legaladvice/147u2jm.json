    "postText": "I was laid off last month. Today I received a notice in the mail from the state of NJ stating that I was \u201cdischarged for poor work performance.\u201d\n\nThis was unexpected because I was told both when I was let go and later when i negotiated my severance that my performance was not the reason for my separation.\n\nI am eligible to collect unemployment, but could this harm me down the road? For example, will future employers be able to see this information in a reference check? I\u2019d like to understand if I need to get an employment lawyer to straighten this out or if it isn\u2019t worth the effort.",

The notice states that because I was discharged for performance and not willful and deliberate disregard for the standards of behavior my employer has a right to expect I am eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nI have not contacted my previous employer yet since I am not well-informed on what the impact of this means.",

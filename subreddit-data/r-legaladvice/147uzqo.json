    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m at a school where I visited a wealthy persons house and they falsely accused me of stealing from their home. This person and I then had a no contact order between us (set by the other person) because they said I was getting too touchy with them. However, I know that a large group of people will soon be visiting this persons home. Would it be considered defamation if I warn a person about going to this persons house?",

However, once you start telling *why* you recommend that, you open the door for a potential defamation claim. Truth is an absolute defense to defamation, but you still have to prove it.",

If you said \"They lied that I stole from them\" that might start entering defamation range, as you are now going from \"the actual facts\" to \"things that you are pertaining as fact that aren't necessarily true\" (lying has a connotation of knowingly being untrue).  Additionally, why are you saying it to the person (I assume your friend)?  Is it to tell them to watch out?  Or is it a paid function and you are trying to cause monetary damages?\n\nIn short, something like this likely wouldn't involve a lawsuit.  Even if you did knowingly defame the person, and the person decided to sue you, there isn't any real damages or assumed damages that I can see from that statement.  BUT if you get sued, it can still be expensive.  It's unlikely you'd get sued, but there is lots of information being omitted here that makes the advice tenuous at best.  Remember, the accuracy of the information you give is the highest accuracy the advice you get can be.",

    "postText": "I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. \n\nThe last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. \n\nThey leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. \n\nThey drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. \n\nThey regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.\n\nThey have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. \n\nThey like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. \n\nI have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. \n\nI recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. \n\nSince then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. \n\nThe woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. \n\nI understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. \n\nI just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. \n\nShe had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. \n\nThey have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. \n\nI have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. \n\nI can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. \n\nThey are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. \n\nIf I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. \n\nAll it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. \n\nI want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?",

Tell your property manager that you are not able to use your apartment as such, that you feel threatened in your own space, and everything you've posted here and they *should* be forced to do something as it technically puts them in breach of contract with you.  And odds are you are the better tenant that they'd rather keep.  ",

Hs the apartment manager instructed them not to park there?  If the manager won't have the car towed out of your space, you shouldn't be paying for it.\n\nIf the landlord isn't providing you with quiet enjoyment of a livable apartment unit, you can terminate the lease, move out, and then if the landlord sues, explain to the judge that you had no choice but to move. \n\nBut as it stands, your post is a bit light on compelling facts of \"This is what I told the landlord, and this is how the landlord has dropped the ball or refuse to take reasonable action.\"  You'll want to document that stuff and might have to give the landlord an opportunity to cure/correct the problem before you terminate the lease.",

I am trying to involve the manager more but when I do I get called names my neighbors and followed out to car with a camera. \n\nIt is sort of become an adult tatteling situation where report a thing and a bully calls me out for it. \n\nI can't afford to move. And my lease is pretty strict. The property manager has said to call her with anything I have an issue with and said she spoke to them. The problem is they apologize to her and say it was all a misunderstanding and vow a change and then take it out on me. Like middle school (I was bullied as 6th grade in sort of the same way). \n\nI am scared that before a solution can be worked out with my apartment that they will find a way to my life worse. \n\n",

If the landlord can't or won't control or evict them or tow their car from your space, the landlord is arguably in breach of its obligations to you. If giving pamphlets saying \"don't park there\" isn't effective the landlord has an obligation to do more. \n\nThe landlord can't reasonably just tell you \"Gee, we gave them a pamphlet and told them to be quieter, not much more we can do, now where's your rent and parking space payment this month.\"\n\nTell the landlord that speaking to them obviously isn't effective and the landlord needs to tow the car or evict them or send them a written pre-eviction demand to cure their breaches of their lease.",

And keep calling the police for anything illegal they do, including the parties late at night.  If your property manager doesn't do something about them, the police may well start charging them a fee for the repeated visits.  That happened to my apartment complex in a similar situation; noise all night, reported every night, got the cops irritated.  That fee isn't small, either.

That is not some concealed carry secret recording advice- it means you have a right to a harassment-free quiet apartment with priority parking you paid for, contractually, that the landlord is required to provide. This is the landlord's problem- however if along the way the tenant kicks up dirt, feel free to report it.\n\nIf there is noise past certain quiet hours, call the police. If they park in your spot, call the tow truck. If they physically or verbally harass you, call the police.\n\nWhere it is legal to record in your home, for your safety, you can record according to the law- you can also get bidirectional dash cams in your car that get wide field of view in case they try to key your car or slash your tires.\n\nObviously these neighbors and many in similar entitled positions (people who harass and have no respect for neighbors while requiring they themselves not receive punitive response) will escalate, and that is certainly a potential problem, treat them as hostile, they've already broken all \"the rules.\" By hostile I don't mean do not be civil with them- you need to demonstrate you're acting as a normal tenant/etc expecting right to privacy, parking, quiet, etc.\n\nBe firm- exert your right to a quiet harassment free apartment and parking space.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

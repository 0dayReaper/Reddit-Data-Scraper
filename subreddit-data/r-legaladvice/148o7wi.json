    "postText": "This is on behalf of a friend who's going through a terrible time and I'd like to be able to help her out.\n\nMy friend is very sick but the doctors can't figure out what's wrong with her at all. She is also immunocompromised. They have put her on ordered bed rest, however her boss just informed her that she needs to return to the office after 3 years of being WFH. At the same time, a coworker was just granted WFH status because she has a baby, so she doesn't understand why she can't continue to WFH too.\n\nThe HR department has told her the only way they will allow her to continue WFH is with a valid medical diagnosis, but again, the doctors do not know what's wrong. My friend is located in Washington. Are there any avenues she can take for accomodations? Is it legal for her to be fired for not returning to the office because she's sick?",

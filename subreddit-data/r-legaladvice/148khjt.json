    "postText": "In some cases, will a talent manager that has ties to, let's say Atlantic Records, charge an upfront fee for their services? I'm aware it may not be common, but could it still be legit?\n\nHe himself lives in New York, but is currently in North Carolina for business. I live in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nFor starters, me and my team reached out to him to pitch my music. He ended up really liking me and a scheduled phone call took place. He talked about the what ifs, and expressed his interest, followed by sending a contract over for review. He still was interested in working regardless of our decision but told us that due to some past experiences, he charges a management fee of $350. So far we have sent him $50 to test the waters, and he doesn't seem in a rush for money. \n\nHe does say however, to move forward with promotion and business, he'd like to be sent the remaining $300 to abide by the contract. Atlantic Records LLC was also mentioned in the contract pertaining to the percentage of what they'd be taking from my gross earnings. Not sure if that matters or not.\n\nHe wants to fly me and my mom out to Atlantic Records. Also, his Instagram content matches the connections he claims to have, and he's managing 2 other artists that seem to be getting results, although I haven't spoke to them personally yet to confirm.",

I cannot speak to your situation.\n\nWhat are you hiring him to do? Manage your career?\n\n&gt; by sending a contract over for review\n\nHave you reviewed this contract? Has your lawyer?\n\n&gt; Atlantic Records LLC was also mentioned in the contract pertaining to the percentage of what they'd be taking from my gross earnings.\n\nIs he acting independently, or are you signing with Atlantic? How exactly are they involved? If he's not acting on their behalf, who is?\n\nAlso, is this *all* your earnings, or just what he books?\n\n&gt; He wants to fly me and my mom out to Atlantic Records.\n\nAre *you* paying for this, or is he? It's possible you may be repaying this through future earnings, similar to receiving an advance.\n\n**Short version: It's time to hire a lawyer to review before you sign that contract.**",

The only thing we see so far as faulty is \"perpetual\", but he's offered to us to make changes and negotiate. \n\n3. He's acting independent as a talent manager,  but claims to be an A&amp;R at Atlantic Records, and it's all my earnings through our contract at 5%. \n\n4. He said in writing that he'd be covering the costs of our trip there. Although it does state in the contract under certain circumstances, it could possibly be repaid by us.",

I know that I am well in my legal right and everything in that video is fair use, but I\u2019m scared if I dispute the strike they might sue me anyways to set an example. What should I do?",

If the AI is taking snippets of audio, that's copyright. Courts are going to have to look into this. It'll take time.",

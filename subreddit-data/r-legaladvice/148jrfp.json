    "postText": "I work with a deaf person in a busy hearing environment (a group home) who uses a voice to text app in common areas when no interpreter is present. He doesn\u2019t always tell people he\u2019s using it, and when he\u2019s in common areas (and he is in his home) the intent is basically just for communication access\n\nI don\u2019t believe the app generates an audio recording, just a text record. \n\nWe know MA is a two-party consent state but does this constitute an illegal recording?",

    "postText": "Hello all and thank you for taking your time to read this post. Before I dive further into the matter I shall establish a bit of back story. I (26M) was granted the opportunity to be a courtesy officer at a high-end apartment complex with half off the rent (about 700 for a three bedroom) while I was working for the local sheriff's department (at this point 5 years into my career) in Louisiana. When I filled out the initial paperwork for the apartment I listed my child's mother (who we will refer to as Ave) as someone who would also be moving into the apartment, however, when it came time for the applications (each with a $50 application fee) we had both decided against her moving in. Thus I was the only one to place an application for the apartment. All utilities for the apartment where also placed into my name. Therefore, I should be the only subject who's name is associated with the lease/apartment. \n\nApproximately two months into the one year lease I was let go from my position in the sheriff's office due to trying the devils lettuce and coincidentally being drug tested not even a week later (poor life decisions, I know. Go ahead and roast me lol). I informed the property manager, who gave me the option of remaining with the year long lease at full price of the rent ($1500), or they could void my contact and I would have about a month to find residence elsewhere. I chose to void my contract and was out of the apartment within two weeks. \n\nI moved out of the apartment about two weeks into the month of December, however, I had already paid the discounted rent amount for the month of December. I was told I would receive a check at my new address for reimbursement of the rent that I was no longer there to benefit from. Within a week I received a check in the mail for an amount close to $500, however, both my name and Ave's name was listed on the check. The particular way it was written on the check meant both myself and Ave would have to be present to cash the check. I reached out to Ave, but due to not being on good terms she refused to aid in cashing the check. \n\nI contacted the property manager and informed them of the issue, to which, I was told to bring the check back to the office to have a new one sent out. Over the course of approximately 2-3 months I received TWO more checks with the EXACT same verbiage of pay to the order of John &amp; Ave. After this third incident, I was told by the property manager that a direct deposit form would be sent to my address to simply have the funds wired directly into my account. \n\nThe time came that I received the form, filled it out (double checking my account/routing information was correct), and brought the form directly to the property manager. I dropped the form off approximately May 5th, and after a month long wait I had not received my payment. \n\nI was able to obtain a phone number for the main office of the company that oversees my previous apartment complex, as well as, others around the state. I called and spoke to someone, expressed my discomfort in the fact that it had been six months and I have still yet to be paid. She stated she would contact accounts payable, and have them contact me back in approximately 2-3 days. The representative I spoke to also mentioned they would attempt to follow up with me as well in the same time frame. This was about 5 days ago. It is infuriating simply because if the roles were reversed, and I owed them money I have no doubt they would relentlessly attempt to get their money from me, in a timely manner. \n\nI am not too fluent in civil law as I only dealt with criminal law in my career. So my concern is as follows: I know obtaining a lawyer in general is not a cheap task, however, I do not know if their negligence in sending the same faulty check three times, as well as, their failure to communicate once the problem was brought to a higher level's attention warrants extra compensation? I know it sounds greedy.   \n   \nI am sorry for such a long post, however, I have spoken to the people closest to me who could not provide any good insight into the situation. Thank you in advance for any comments/suggestions!",

            "comment": "If you do make phone calls, then keep a detailed log of who-what-when for every call. For everyone you talk to ask for a direct dial number and an email address. Follow up every phone call in writing. An email is fine. It just needs to contain a short, concise and accurate summary of what was discussed. \n\nI don't know of any law in Louisiana that would somehow entitle you to compensation beyond the money that is owed to you. \n\nNote that all of this assumes that you are entitled to the partial rent refund for moving out early. Not all leases would allow for this. \n\nSeems like the easiest way to do this would be to have had Ave endorse the check over to you.",

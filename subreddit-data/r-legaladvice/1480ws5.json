    "postText": "The fire department I work for has outside companies do our physicals every year. Up until 3 years ago, we used a different company than we currently use. I\u2019m trying to find my medical records for my physicals for the last 8 years to turn in for the \u201cwellness benefit\u201d I have through Aflac. You basically get paid for proving you have a physical done every year. I called this service we used before to ask them, and they said they haven\u2019t name in the same but no longer have my medical records\u2014 she specifically said that they switched charting systems and lost the records of everyone they had prior. \n\nEverything I\u2019ve looked at says they\u2019re required to keep medical records for 7 years, which is also the law the applies to our departments EMA service. What do I do? Seems very odd to me.\n\nEdit: Indiana",

            "comment": "I\u2019d probably start here with a HIPAA and perhaps a state regulatory complaint.  \n\nIf this company truly lost (that wouldn\u2019t be scheduled archival or obsolescence) all records in a move to new software they may have already self reported this breach.  But I\u2019d get state and federal regulators involved.  \n\nIf the records are lost they\u2019re, presumably, lost.  It may be that there are some backups that were too difficult to retrieve until HHS told them to.  If they\u2019re lost I\u2019d work with AFLAC to see if any records the fire department has (surely they\u2019ve got *something* suggesting you completed your physical and hopefully that there was nothing of note each year) will meet their requirements.  There\u2019s no harm in consulting a lawyer, but the provider having liability for this is a stretch.",

I am part of a union who said that legally they're not allowed to help but gave me the number of a laYork. \n\nThey also told me the company who handles my claim, not naming names but they're based off a statue in New york, said they automatically contest every claim to take advantage of people who can't afford a lawyer or don't want to go through the whole process.\n\nIf I do represent myself does anyone have any advice to give me besides just myself being truthful and honest? Thanks.",

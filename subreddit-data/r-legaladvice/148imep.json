    "postText": "My son was hospitalized earlier this year. An ambulance service was needed to transfer him to another hospital. Our insurance used a third-party to negotiate with the ambulance provider. Our insurance is saying that we are only responsible for about $250. The ambulance accepted the payment from the third party and applied to the account. The ambulance company then balance billed for the remaining $2,500. During a three-way conversation with my insurance, they stated that the ambulance company could not balance bill since they accepted the negotiated amount from the third-party. The discussion became heated with the ambulance supervisor, and they probably ended the call stating that they reach out to the third-party. My insurance instructed me not to pay any further until the balance is adjusted. I have contacted the ambulance company multiple times but the supervisor I spoke with is not returning my calls. It has been about two months now and they are starting to charge interest on the account. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is the lawyer territory yet, but was wondering what my options are?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone \n\nThrowaway account because I use my other under my real name \n\nMy father passed away several years ago, his ex wife lives in his home with a life interest. My sister has her own home, but I still rent. \n\nI wonder if there is a way to force the property to be sold, or another recourse that could allow me my share in the property early? \n\nTo add further complications, my sister is one of the executors and my ex step mother the other, I do not see eye to eye with them, and am worried they could do something with my share of the property when it does sell, if I have no way to force a sale. What could I look into to have executors changed for someone unbiased or similar?\n\nUK based \n\nTYIA for any advice",

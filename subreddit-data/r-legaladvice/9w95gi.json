    "postText": "This happened last week, he's only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.\n\nThey then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).\n\nWe called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.\n\nWe got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).\n\nWe continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.\n\nWe get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their \"guns\". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt \"Creepers\" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.\n\nWhen they finally let him go some guy in a suit says \"sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go\" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.\n\nThey kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or \"do weird things\" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him \"where is this picture taken\" or \"who was there\" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.\n\nThe school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us \"the issue is closed\" and hangup. What the hell do we do?\n\nEdit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",

This isn\u2019t a joke or something you should do to \u201cget back\u201d at the police. It\u2019s fucking childish and can seriously traumatize other children or even adults.

I could care less what the school tries to do, and if he's making the report in good faith (talking about guns in school) not much of anything, maybe a fine will happen. If they can't begin seeing how crazy it was, so be it. A few lockdowns and other kids questioned will let them see the insanity of it. If my kid is going to get punished for something every kid talks about in school, let them deal with it.",

Well the same goes for kids talking about guns at school.  \n\nSo ... teach your kid that he shouldn\u2019t mention shooting guns at school and start a complaint process about the fact that the school didn\u2019t immediately notify you nor were you allowed to be with your child during questioning.  \n\nBut the people reporting hearing the conversation?

One of the most infuriating parts of criminal procedure is that courts have upheld instances where cops have failed to inform people under interrogation that their lawyer has asked to see them. What's worse is that the lawyer can be waiting for hours to see their client just like these parents were. The only way around it is for the individual to request their lawyer. This is something that needs to be taught to children and adults. ",

I agree that education in advance on how to say nothing other than identifying themselves and politely but firmly requesting both a parent and a lawyer be present is also extremely important.     \n\nI do NOT know of a test case where the police have denied a lawyer to a minor when the parents requested it though, and I strongly suspect a court would at least consider a parent invoking their 11 year old's right to have an attorney present vicariously.   If it comes down to trying to get statements thrown out...  the totality of circumstance is considered and everything you can put in the 'questionable behavior by police' column is a plus.  Having your lawyer present is the best way to make certain accessing your child doesn't take a second longer than it has to, and it keeps the department on notice that you're not ignorant bumpkins to be pushed around.",

Get out to the ladies car and my baby brother (middle school age) was out there just sobbing. The whole way to wherever we were going this B is antagonizing my brother and getting him to cry harder. I don't remember the first question she directed at me but I do remember my answer. ' I would like to speak to my lawyer'. Lady didn't know how to handle me and kept insisting I didn't have a right to a lawyer. Well I was 15, and stubborn, so my answer never changed and seeing me be so bold my brother began to follow suit. They got zero answers out of us in about 5/6 hours and finally let my parents take us. Just remembering how upset my baby brother was is making me angry and it's been 17 years. ",

That's not a situation in which any normal person would think they were free to go.\n\nAnd if it is a custodial interrogation, wouldn't he have received the Miranda warnings and have been advised of his right to remain silent or right to an attorney?  And if the child requested to speak to his parents or an attorney, wouldn't the police have had to honor that request?\n\nAnd even if the child _isn't_ considered under arrest, wouldn't [Sec. 52.025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FA/pdf/FA.52.pdf) of the Family Code apply?  Two relevant portions:\n\n&gt; (c) A child may not be left unattended in a juvenile\nprocessing office and is entitled to be accompanied by the child's\nparent, guardian, or other custodian or by the child's attorney.\n\n&gt; (d) A child may not be detained in a juvenile processing\noffice for longer than six hours.\n\n[This article](https://mic.com/articles/125434/texas-police-violate-ahmed-mohamed-s-civil-rights-by-keeping-him-from-parents-and-lawyer#.tObbca7Sd) about Ahmed Mohamed's arrest mentions that part of the code.",

In re Boucher clarified that if the police had knowledge of what was on the phone, \"we know there are pictures of the plan, they are photos 100 and 101\" then the foregone conclusion doctrine applies, and the password and fingerprint may be compelled in either instance including the person identifying which finger unlocks the phone.",

They got angry when he would not answer their questions &amp; tried to have him put in juvenile detention for not speaking.  WTF.  It was some other group of kids who made noise in bathroom;  he wrongly assumed since it wasn't him he had nothing to worry about.  \n\nA civil rights attorney is expensive but will put fear of God into both police and school.  Kids rights are poorly defined, however schools and police quake at a good civil rights atty.  Ours just wrote a letter and after that things sort of went away.\n\nSo sorry you had this happen.

I would definitely be wary about them going through his phone so much and I\u2019d check it for bugging (who knows what they did, I don\u2019t trust cops because they are cops). I think back on how the nikolas Cruz kid has commented multiple times on YouTube vids saying he wants to be a school shooter (one of the youtubers even called the cops about the comment), his social media was plagued with warning photos, and he was noted by his peers that he was definitely the kid \u201cwho would become a school shooter.\u201d  Yet the cops didn\u2019t have enough credible sources there to be doing 9 hours of interviewing beforehand? Definitely gotta protect our kids now, even from the ones who were the safety. ",

It is also strange that the school wouldn't have called you to let you know your child was no longer in campus.  \n\nFor the school end of things, I would demand a meeting to find out exactly what transpired at school, how it was reported, why no other students were questioned, and why no one informed you that your child had been removed from campus.  I would also be calling the main office in the school district and Lodge a complaint about this so that the school cannot continue to ignore you.",

Mind you the American government has run vile experiments on its own people, segregated and beat its own people, cops kill alot (don't know the number, but do know it's unacceptable) of people a year. \n\nSo in conclusion I will hold on to my boomstick and you can enjoy your very safe existence that I whole heatedly envy .",

At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).\n&gt; \n&gt; We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.\n&gt; \n&gt; We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).\n&gt; \n&gt; We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.\n&gt; \n&gt; We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their \"guns\". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt \"Creepers\" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says \"sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go\" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or \"do weird things\" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him \"where is this picture taken\" or \"who was there\" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us \"the issue is closed\" and hangup. What the hell do we do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.2836 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

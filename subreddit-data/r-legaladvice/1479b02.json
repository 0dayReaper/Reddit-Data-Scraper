    "postText": "Hi all\n\nMy father passed away yesterday likely due to complications from his COPD (Last message from the authorities was that there would not be an autopsy). While reviewing his chart, it says that he was switched from Symbicort and it was replaced with Wixela. Elsewhere in his chart, it is noted that he stated he had a harder time breathing while using Wixela. Looking at the (admittedly limited) reviews of Wixela, many people have commented the same. \n\nCan this be considered negligence? Can anything be done about this? It\u2019s possible my dad would still be here if they hadn\u2019t changed his medication.",

This will be difficult and you will likely need to find a lawyer who specializes in this. \n\nAlso Wixela and Symbicort are generally accepted to be interchangeable by most doctors and different insurances will sometimes only cover one or the other. It will be difficult to prove that switching his meds is what caused this.\n\nAlso you can request an autopsy. It is not up to \u201cauthorities\u201d to decide whether or not he gets one, it is up to the family. You might be getting it mixed up with whether or not it is a medical examiner case. However in my experience, autopsies are rarely useful especially in older people with multiple chronic conditions.",

But inhalers in COPD are mostly for symptom management and have little impact on mortality. The things that uncontroversially reduce mortality in COPD are smoking cessation, supplemental oxygen if sats 88% or lower, and possibly pulmonary rehab, non-invasive ventilation, and lung volume reduction surgery in select patients. I did find one network meta-analysis that suggested reduced mortality from a couple of inhaled drugs but ironically one of them was fluticasone-salmeterol, which is what is in Wixela. There really is no case to be made that choosing Wixela over Symbicort caused his premature death. An autopsy would not be able to establish that in any case.\n\nEdit: corrected to say \u201creduced mortality\u201d",

To what extent did the medication cause him to die early? \n\nYour dad\u2019s COPD would have likely been the cause of his death. Did he quit the behaviors which led to his COPD(if any), was he in compliance with 100% of his treatment and medications?\n\nBecause of the amount of medications and treatment usually involved in managing COPD, there is seldom 100% compliance. Not saying your dad wasn\u2019t, but this is something that the defense could also use, if you were able to bring an action.",

One is in the right to sue - but it will take a good law group (not single lawyer) because they will have to float the costs for an expert to contradict what the VA says.  \n\n\nI personally feel your pain and wish there was more one can do, but really ones options are limited.",

    "postText": "I want to exchange my Lexus 2022 NX350h because I don\u2019t feel safe driving it due to issues with the braking system. \n\nFirst, when I am stopped the car lurches forward and I take my foot off the brakes. Second, they are abrupt and grabby when I press them to slow down. I have already had an accident where the car lurched forward when I let off the brakes causing me to a rear end the car ahead of me when I was in a fast-food pickup line.  \nAlso when I\u2019m driving on the highway and have to press on the brakes to slow down the brakes grab and the car rapidly decelerates causing things to fly forward off the seats. I worry that someone might rear-end me because of the abruptness of the deceleration.  \nOne other note: I have leased or owned five cars from the same dealership in the last fourteen years.  \nHow do I go about exchanging the car without getting fleeced?",

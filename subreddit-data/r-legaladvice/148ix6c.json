He can enforce judgment by garnishing wages, selling certain pieces of your property, etc..",

They\u2019ll get a piece of paper saying you owe them x. It\u2019ll last for years before it can be renewed. Maybe your lot in life changes in the next few years and they\u2019ll have some way to collect.",

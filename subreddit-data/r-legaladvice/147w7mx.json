    "postText": "Sorry I'm advance about how long this is\nI literally don't even know where else to reach out to at this point I've tried calling attorney after attorney and none of them will even speak to a tenant about an issue so if any attorneys have solid advice I would be so grateful also I'm in utah,  so this issue started back on 2/14/2023 I had just resigned my lease for another year and my landlord left a notice on everyone is my buildings door saying smoking cigarettes or marijuana inside or on the patio is a violation of our lease and they have had complaints that someone is smoking both inside or on the patio and they will be doing inspections this week but will not be giving any notice on when (I assume to try and catch whoever it is smoking) they will be coming so I waited a week and no one ever came to do an inspection at all so I waited another week and nothing. also I have absolutely no idea who is smoking in the building it isn't coming from my apartment. So I stopped caring about them coming and went on like normal and then the bi annual inspection happened in mid April of 2023 and that went over perfectly fine I have had no issues at all, then on June 8th 2023 I got a 3 day comply or vacate notice on my door saying I was in violation of my lease for smoking. I do not smoke in or outside of my apartment. I called the office about it and they said they have had numerous complaints from my upstairs neighbors and my downstairs neighbors that someone is smoking cigarettes on the patio and smoking marijuana in the closet which is a very strange accusation and they said they are going to do inspections sometime this week but will not tell me that date again and it's really invading my privacy. On the 3 day comply or vacate notice it does say that after three days have expired an inspection will be done to make sure your complying but it's now been 4 days and nothing according to Utah state law it says a landlord has to give you 24 hour notice before entering the premise unless otherwise states in your lease but on my lease it says this \n\n\"14. RIGHT OF ENTRY:\r\nUnless otherwise restricted by law, Owner may enter the Premises during reasonable hours with or without notice in \r\norder to inspect, make repairs, provide general or preventive maintenance, replace filters, leave any notices, and/or for \r\nany other reasonable business purposes whether Resident is or is not present in the Premises. If Resident is not present \r\nat the Premises, then Owner will have the same right to such entry by duplicate or master key. If, in Owner\u2019s opinion, \r\nthere exists an emergency or a violation of this Agreement exists, Owner may enter without notice at any time for any \r\ninspection, repair, or to determine the condition or occupancy of the Premises. It is the intent of the parties hereto that \r\nthis provision grant Owner immediate access to the Premises if Resident is in default of any term of this Agreement, \r\nimmediate access if in Owner\u2019s sole opinion giving notice could change an investigation, immediate access to investigate \r\na claimed violation, and that this provision be interpreted with the existing law to grant as broad and timely access as \r\npossible and permissible. Any request for maintenance/repairs or a Fit Premises Notice shall be deemed to give Owner \r\nauthority to enter the Premises without requiring notice or further permission. Owner may secure the Premises at any \r\ntime Owner deems, in its sole discretion, that the security of the Premises may have been compromised, including but \r\nnot limited to death of a Resident, incarceration or hospitalization of a Resident, usage of the Premises by non-residents, \r\nand protection of Owner\u2019s assets or security\" \n\nThe part that is concerning is the first bit Unless otherwise restricted by law, Owner may enter the Premises during reasonable hours with or without notice but how it's all worded I'm not sure if they can enter without 24 hour notice or if they can or what I can really do because right now I have 0 privacy because they will literally knock twice and then walk in to my apartment I could be changing, using the restroom, in the \"bedroom\" and it really makes me uncomfortable not to mention they always bring these maintenance men with them that are shady to say the least and I have a lot of valuables in my house that I don't want stolen. Sorry for the giant post but I'm at my wits end. Any suggestions?",

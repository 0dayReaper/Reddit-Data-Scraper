    "postText": "I arrived in the country on 2/22/2022 with a job promise which unfortunately the company could not fulfill. Since they would not take care of my visa I had to find a solution. My partner (Spanish, living in the UK for 11 years) has settled so we decided to ask for my pre-settlement since we didn't know what else to do. I found a job at a coffee shop while my application was in progress. Which they rejected for not having lived together for two years. so a need to quit the job. We looked for help at local citizen advice and they told us that the only way would be to ask for a fianc\u00e9 visa and once accepted, get married and get the wife's visa. It seemed good to us so we did so.\r  \n\r  \nMy problem comes when after more than nine months, thousands of calls to different numbers (including paid numbers), countless emails to all Home office addresses, postal letters, face-to-face visits to the office, contacted my MP, tried to contact the Spanish consulate and with all this I have not received any response or at least an update on my visa. even having paid more than 3500gbp. Tired of the situation, I even asked for the return of my documents and they have ignored it and I still do not have my passport. So I haven't been able to see my loved ones for a year. Anyone would say that the country has kidnapped me.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to all this, obviously, I do not have the legal right to work, so I have been stuck in a 35m2 apartment for nine months without being able to do absolutely nothing since we are two adults (with special needs) living on a salary of 1500gbp. Our families and friends are in Spain and their situation does not allow them to help us.\r  \nAlso seventeen years ago I was diagnosed with a mental disorder which was controlled when I moved and due to the situation it has worsened considerably, having to increase and add medication.\r  \n\r  \nNobody is taking responsibility for this situation and nobody wants to help me, I don't know what else to do. I have thought about going to the media or perhaps filing some kind of complaint.\r  \n\r  \nI unconditionally want to stay in this country, but I need the government to accept it in order to have a dignified and legal life.\r  \nI know that the waiting time may have increased, but I have it on good authority that others who applied for the same visa around the same date as me have already had results for months.",

You chose to remain in the UK after your job offer was rescinded in the hopes that you could obtain permission to remain.  That alone was a helluva gamble.  Then you applied for a visa that you clearly didn't qualify for and were rejected.  The Home Office may be happy to arrange for the return of your travel documents as long as you are willing to withdraw your application for entry and catch the next flight home.\n\nIt's well past time for you to consult an immigration solicitor.  One of the reasons why your application isn't being processed as quickly as everyone else's is because of you haven't been doing things by the book.",

            "comment": "NAL But I have been through the UK immigration process. After 911, the UK tightened up all its immigration laws. I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear, but it\u2019s almost impossible to change immigration status once you\u2019re inside the country. \n\nAs you found out, to be granted a visa for a legal partnership, you must be living with your partner for at least two years and be able to prove it with documentation. \n\nYou\u2019ve not been kidnapped. If you want your documents back to return to your home country then you need to take action to get them back, even if that means telephoning every day. You can get a lawyer involved but it\u2019s going to cost significant money. The media is also not going to help you. I know you must feel like you\u2019re in limbo just waiting for something to happen.\n\nLook at it this way.\n\nThe general rule to receive a fianc\u00e9 visa is to apply from your own country, which means getting back your documents, returning home, and reapplying. Your asking immigration to circumvent the rules and grant you a visa change from within the country. If this is the path you and your partner has decided upon, then you have no choice but to wait out the decision from immigration.",

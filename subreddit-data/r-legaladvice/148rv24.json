    "postText": "Today, my friend got pulled over for driving 140mph on the motorway, was charged for speeding and aggravated driving, pulled over by an unmarked police car. When asked how fast he was going he said \u201cbetween 80 or 90 mph, wasn\u2019t sure as I was paying attention to the road\u201d. Had his information taken down and got told to wait back in his own car while the police looked at the evidence. \n\nA short while later, both police officers then tell him to step out of the car and was told what he was being prosecuted for and the evidence was being sent off, then was allowed to drive home. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a few people about this and having mixed opinions, did the police not have sufficient evidence, because at those kind of speeds they\u2019d take your license and car there and then. \n\nOther people are saying they\u2019ll take him to court and he\u2019d lose his license there. \nWould appreciate anybody\u2019s opinions, or suggestions into what he should do and how to plea if it does go to court.",

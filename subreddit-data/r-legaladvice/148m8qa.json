    "postText": "Long story short, we got rear ended at a red light and we chased the driver. She admitted she wasn\u2019t looking. My BF was being too nice and agreed to let it be a hit and run without getting the plates so the suspect can just send us the money for the deductible. Surprise surprise, she didn\u2019t respond and ended blocking my BF no matter how many times I said to sue her. We do have a text message from her agreeing to pay. I just want to know are there consequences for not telling the insurance and police the truth?\n\nEDIT: the suspect driver had no insurance and no license. My BF felt bad because her car was so wrecked. Again, I really wanted to call the cops but he insisted not to.",

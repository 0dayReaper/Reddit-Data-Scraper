    "postText": "My former friend/ex verbally informed me that he has been GPS tracking my car after weeks of him texting remarks about my location that he couldn't have known otherwise. After telling me this, he pulled up his cell phone in my presence and scrolled, muttering \"didn't transmit...didn't transmit...at your house...didn't transmit..\". When I spoke to a close friend of mine about this (who also dated him), she told me that years ago he admitted to her that he has access to some kind of software or database due to him being a mechanic which allows him to track where cars are or have been, and acknowledged that he isn't supposed to access that.\n\nnote - I have had my car looked at by a mechanic and they have not found a GPS device that would provide tangible proof.\n\nWhat are my legal options here? I am based in the USA (OR)",

A police report may help, if nothing else to start a paper trail. You may want to call your vehicle manufacturers customer service dept and see if they can help you. If you and the other ex have the same make of vehicle, GM, Kia, etc, then this is even more likely how. Beyond that, getting a professional private investigator to do a \"bug sweep\" of your car might be a good idea. If the PI finds anything, call the police. NAL, NLA. Best of luck!",

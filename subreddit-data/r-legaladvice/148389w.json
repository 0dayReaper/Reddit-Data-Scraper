    "postText": "My son is (theoretically) receiving an inheritance from an intestate estate. He is the sole beneficiary. Taxes were filed (without our authorization, and actually explicitly against our instruction) under his social security number during the second year after the death. (Regular income taxes were filed the first year.) These taxes amounted to approximately 1/3 of the initial value of the estate. After taxes and debts, less than half of the value remains. \n\nWe were sent a letter saying that the estate has been closed, and that our son is the sole beneficiary. That the money has to be kept in a savings account until he reaches the age of majority, and cannot otherwise be used without a court order. We have thus far not received any money. We were instructed to pay for the accountant fees to file the taxes, and the estate has refused to reimburse us for them (he otherwise would\u2019ve been filed under our taxes as usual, not incurring additional filing expense). We are in PA. \n\nThe questions we currently have are:\nWill we receive the money to put in an account for him? Or does the executor have involvement/oversight in this? If we do, can it be his existing savings account, or can we put it somewhere else where it can earn interest?\nHave all of the taxes been paid at this point, or will this be an ongoing and/or annual thing? Will more taxes be owed when he\u2019s able to actually access the money? \n\nThe executor has made it abundantly clear that his priority is *not* our son. We are weighing whether any ongoing required interactions with the executor are worth the money that remains (and if that money will actually be there when he\u2019s old enough to receive it), or if we should consider declining the inheritance. \n\nAny insight appreciated. Happy to answer any questions if I\u2019ve left out info.",

Something is missing in this understanding or things are not progressing as they should.  \n\nNo one should file income taxes on your son\u2019s behalf, for example.  And while trusts are common for transfers to minors, this where you\u2019re paying for things but have no information or control isn\u2019t.\n\nEdit to add:  What is your relationship to this son?  What is the deceased\u2019s relationship?  There\u2019s obviously a wrinkle here like this is a biological parent\u2019s estate or a biological grandparent to whom you\u2019re not related right?  That\u2019s the only thing that starts to bring this together.  And then perhaps it makes some sense.",

He died and we live in PA. The executor (is that the same as the estate administrator?) was his brother. I trust him as far as I can throw him - he collected money on my son\u2019s behalf at a memorial service we\u2019ve never seen, too. But the letter we received definitely documents the money he reimbursed himself from the estate. \n\nWe thought that there would be no money left after the estate was settled (which is why we never hired a lawyer in the first place), and asked (via the brother, the lawyer and the accountant) multiple times for information on the estate/status of things, and they never provided information. When they asked for my son\u2019s social for tax purposes, we explicitly said until they could provide us documentation about the debts/what was in the estate/etc that we did not permit taxes to be filed. They did it anyway (I\u2019m assuming his social was on old tax paperwork at the residence they found?).\n\nEdit sorry remaining is ~50k. We didn\u2019t know if the tax situation would be ongoing every year, with us being responsible now for taxes out of pocket, and with the likelihood of no money remaining when he comes of age. That was our main concern and why we were considering declining it, as well as the concern about having to remain in contact with someone who is not a healthy relationship for our son.",

            "comment": "How much money are you expecting to receive?\n\nYou have not been given a complete explanation here of how and why things have been done the way they have been.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, if there was a will, the executor would have been legally required to send each beneficiary a copy of the will.  Since this is an intestate estate, the personal representative should have sent you and your son the basic information about what the source of this account was--did it come from an investment account or 401K where your son was named as a beneficiary?  Was a bank account or a trust account previously set up by the decedent and your son was named beneficiary?\n\nYou or your attorney should be asking for a copy of the estate tax return, if one has been prepared.  It's possible that your son's SSN might have been required for income tax reporting purposes if a form W9 was required because the personal representative had to report to the IRS that an inheritance had been paid out to your son.  You or your attorney should ask \"Did the PR fill out a form W9 for our son or not?  Exactly when and where was our son's SSN reported?\"\n\nYour or your attorney should be asking for an accounting report, which is your son's right as a beneficiary.  You need to know what other assets, if any, are in this estate.  It's the PR's responsibility to pay taxes, if there are any taxes payable by the estate, to pay those taxes out of the ESTATE assets.  Under normal circumstances, the beneficiary should not be paying taxes unless there is an explanation for the PR doing that.\n\nIt's hard to understand why he would place these funds in a savings account and from the description it sounds like he might have put the money into a UTMA/UGMA account that is controlled by a custodian until your son reaches 18.  You or your attorney need to ask for the information about what bank this account is held at and ask who is the custodian of the account.  He had no legal authority to put that money into that type of account.  No reason why this money shouldn't have been put into a regular savings account or paid directly to the beneficiary, except to make it difficult for the beneficiary to get access to these funds.\n\nThere will be no ongoing tax liability, but since the estate is closed it's apparently too late to submit a claim for reimbursement of the taxes already paid and it's maybe too late to even ask for an accounting report.\n\nYou and your attorney should be looking at all of the paperwork in this probate file to review exactly what this PR did and whether his actions were proper or illegal.  You already had reasons to suspect the irrational behavior-",

In hindsight I do regret not looking into a lawyer initially, but that ship has long sailed. \n\nAccording to the letter we received, there is just over 50k left. It states \u201cThe Personal Representative/ Accountant requests that distribution to the minor child be deposited in a savings account in the name of the minor child in banks, building and loan associations or savings and loan associations insured by a Federal governmental agency\u201d - but we have yet to see any money, so I\u2019m not sure who is actually responsible for doing that/where the money is now. The letter also lists assets and debts/disbursements, as well as fees and taxes. There are only 3 physical items listed on the asset list, so who knows what they did with his physical property. They did give my son a few items he requested initially, but other things we\u2019ve requested they have said \u201cthe family\u201d will be holding on to until he\u2019s 18 or that it\u2019s gone/was never found. \nWe did ask multiple times (in writing and verbally, including of the lawyer and accountant) for copies of the draft tax return and an accounting report of the estate. When we said that we did not authorize them to file the taxes under his social, it was in response to this - that we (well, our accountant) wanted to review these documents prior to agreeing to anything/filing anything under his social. \n\nIt seems clear our next (long overdue) step is to look into hiring an attorney, although it seems as though our options may be limited at this point.",

But the fastest method is to enlist the help of a real estate or estate lawyer to get a new deed drafted and filed. \n\nMost areas require a filing fee of a few hundred dollars. Some areas require taxes as well - so it\u2019s important to know your locale\u2019s laws and how to avoid transfer taxes if possible/legal. \n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need the original deed - it\u2019s not a \u2018sealed\u2019 document or anything. But most oils use the prior deed to complete the new deed since it requires quite a bit of specific information about the property itself.",

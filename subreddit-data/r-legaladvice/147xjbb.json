    "postText": "I'm planning on moving to the US with my children from the UK. My daughter's father will remain here. I have support there, good job opportunities and my children will meet their family. We do not have contact with my family here. I am struggling to find work and right now cannot find a job that will work around my availability.\n\nThe father, does not work, smokes weed, does coke, refuses to have our daughter for more than an afternoon due to his lifestyle. He has a lot of disposable income and would have more if he budgeted his money.\n\nIf I present him with a document stating that if he pays for flights, I will provide everything else plus Skype/zoom calls everyday. Would this be considered fair opportunity for him to see and have contact with his daughter in court? Because he doesn't work, he could fly over anytime and stay for upto 3 months at a time. I would cover expenses whilst he was there, he only needs to pay for flights.",

I can't stay here, I'm severely depressed and desperately need help. I've exhausted all resources here. At least there, my father will help with my kids if I'm at work. Tbh, I just want help and my family back. I regret moving back to the UK.",

I can't even afford my bill's but he's manipulative and will just turn up when he runs out of money.

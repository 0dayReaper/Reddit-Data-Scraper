    "postText": "NY. I went to college from 2010-2014. In 2011, I was diagnosed with ADHD by a private psychiatrist.  When I went to the disability center for accommodations, I was told my ADHD was not serious enough for accommodations, before I could even show them any paperwork.\n\nIn 2012, I was told I couldn\u2019t go on a study tour abroad if I didn\u2019t share my private health information and tell the professor about my mental health diagnosis and my medications. Later in 2013, I was told I couldn\u2019t go on another study tour because I didn\u2019t wake up on time in the previous one. The reason I didn\u2019t wake up was because I was in Trazodone and Seroquel.\n\nAlso in 2013, the nurse practitioner on my campus told me she could no longer prescribe me medications because I would not go to therapy at the counseling center, even though the counselors were unhelpful and possibly caused me more harm.\n\nI have none of this in writing. They would call me into meetings to relay this information and my parents were deceased so I was alone? Is it too late to sue and would i even be able to if I have nothing in writing?",

            "comment": "It's most likely past any time you would have to sue, but you also need proof to sue someone successfully. That is proof both of their actions and your damages. \n\nEven if there were proof and it was timely, there are several parts of your description that are problematic. First off, failure to provide reasonable accommodation under the ADA is different from discrimination. Just FYI in case you need the knowledge in the future. For accommodations you need both a diagnosis and a statement from a doctor describing what accommodations you require. If you had that, they were required to provide reasonable accommodations.\n\nWhen it comes to the study abroad trips, their requirements/ responses are likely okay. It's normal and reasonable to require medication and related information be shared with the trip leader for safety reasons. Also, if you couldn't get up on time on a previous trip, and that impacted others or the trip as a whole, they could deny you participation based on that. \n\nThe medication issue can be murky. Clinics can have rules about who they treat and how, even on college campuses. And providers are cautious about prescribing stimulants, because they have street value. The clinic policy could be that the psychiatrist/ psych NP was only available as an adjunct to therapy for clients at the counseling center. Or some providers will only prescribe stimulants if someone is seeing a therapist and allows communication with them, as an extra precaution. You were free to seek treatment elsewhere if you weren't comfortable with their policies.\n\nNone of this is to say they were right. I don't know that either way. But the more you know, the more prepared you are for the future.",

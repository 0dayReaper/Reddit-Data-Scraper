    "postText": "I work for a small company in California (10-15 employees). I\u2019m in a tough spot with my job and I would greatly appreciate any advice. \n\nCurrently at work we do not have; a bathroom, break room, running water, there is no overtime pay, no breaks, no lunch breaks, no a/c or heater, no HR person, and probably a few other things that have slipped my mind for now. This is the situation for all employees who work onsite. \n\nI have worked full time there for over 3 years. Recently I have been diagnosed with a bladder disorder. This may be directly linked to not having a bathroom at work as I have only two choices 1) hold my urine all day 2) clock out and leave to use the bathroom at home. With constantly leaving to use the restroom my paychecks are suffering. The new medical bills from the bladder disorder isn\u2019t helping. \n\nI want to know what my options are or what I should do while being in this situation. I am in the process of seeking legal advice as well.",

This is touching on all three orgs.",

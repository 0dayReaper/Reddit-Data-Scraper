    "postText": "My ex abused both me and my child. He wasn\u2019t listed on the birth certificate for various reasons and it has been two years and he has not seen our kid, and has not filed for visitation of any kind. She\u2019s 14. I really want a fresh start and to move and have been approved for an apartment out of state. However, I googled and it says I am supposed to give 30 days notice in Virginia. Is this the case when there is no legal paternity established? We were not married or cohabitating when my child was born, he isn\u2019t listed on the birth certificate, and we have never been to court. I\u2019m just confused on if this 30 days notice counts in my situation.",

He'd need to take you to court to establish that. If he's a not so great guy like you make it seem, he probably doesn't wanna do that as that could mean him paying child support. \n\nEither way, if you can afford it, a short consult with a attorney who focuses on child custody would get you solid answers",

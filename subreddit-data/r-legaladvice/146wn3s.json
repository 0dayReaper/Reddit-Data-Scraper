    "postText": "(BELTON, TX, USA)\nI need to evict my boyfriend from our house. I have told him repeatedly that I want to break up and I don't want him here, and he refuses to leave says \"no, we're working things out.\" I own the house and he has stayed here since 2019 without any rental agreement. He does not pay rent but he does get his mail here. I want to just tell him to leave and say that I will call the cops if he doesn't leave. Can I legally do that since he isn't on a lease? I'd really like to avoid a 30 day notice if possible because he's abusive in every way except actually hitting me. Living here for 30 days after filing eviction would be hell. I doubt I could get a protective order without physical violence, which he threatens but doesn't follow through on. I don't have anyone that our son and I can live with and I can't afford a hotel. I'm also worried he'll destroy the house during that time.",

Family photos, legal documents, other valuables, etc..  other personal property can be replaced but those either can\u2019t or are \nharder.  If you have a trusted friend or relative you can take them too, at least those items wouldn\u2019t be at risk.",

You and your son\u2019s passports, identification, any documents for the house or any vehicle you own, birth certificates and social security cards are all things to be included. Definitely store elsewhere if you can, otherwise getting a locked (code is best rather than key) fire box and keeping it hidden in your vehicle, preferably if he doesn\u2019t have access, but either way hidden maybe under trunk lining/where spare tire may be, or if you could get a safe deposit box maybe? Again, it\u2019s best to keep at a trusted friend/relative\u2019s home as opera_guy said, but if that isn\u2019t an option those could maybe work? \nEdited for brevity",

Take pictures of any damage to yourself or your belongings. \n\nTexas is a one-party consent state, which means you can record him without him knowing. There are apps that will secretly record in the background and upload online.\n\nDocumenting all of this will help get a restraining/protective order which will keep him out of your house while you get this sorted. \n\nBe safe, friend",

Whether or not that violence is directed at you also varies by jurisdiction, but this may be enough for a protective order which could functionally get him out of the house sooner.  Especially if he has threatened to violence against you or your belongings by text.\n\n\nIf you were my friend in this situation,  I would suggest you speak to a lawyer about getting a protective order.  The court has to issue one temporarily if there sufficient cause to set up a hearing.  The temporary order is usually from the time it is served and lasts until hearing where it may be extended or made permanent.\n\n\nWith a temporary order in hand, you may then be able to arrange for law enforcement to escort your ex while he gathers his belongings in order to vacate in compliance of the PO.\n\n\nMost lawyers offer free consultations, so take advantage and ask a few if this is a route you can take.  Family law attorneys are going to be the most knowledgeable when it comes to situations like yours. Technically,  you're in DIY territory,  but retaining a lawyer to take care of this will save you a ton of stress in this fucked up situation. \n\n\nI hope this helps and that you're able to get back to living your best life as soon as possible.",

Once you have your ducks in a row (i.e. the safety of you, your son, and your property) and give them notice, it can be helpful also to let the outgoing party know you intend on moving forward expediently with the eviction. Advise them to look into the disastrous effect an eviction can have on their future ability to land a rental, a job, credit, etc.\n\nIf they're at all reasonable, they will likely leave before it gets that far; it's just not worth the add-on penalties of being evicted, no matter how much they blame you.",

After that you can file for a forcible detainer (what Texas calls eviction). The whole process should take less than 30 days even if he takes it to court and appeals the decision. That being said, threats of violence generally do warrant restraining/no contact orders. He does not need to have physically touched you, as others have pointed out. You should do both, give him a 3 day notice to vacate and obtain a protective order. And as others have also said, you need to protect yourself and your assets while you wait for this to resolve. Take anything and everything that\u2019s important to you and stay with a friend while this works its way through the legal system.",

Sadly this will probably be more ugly as time progresses so be prepared for a small and probably hurtful battle of he said she said bad mouthing.    \n\n\nAlso one must check for tenants rights - it might be better to just hire a lawyer for a couple thousand bucks and let them force him out.  That way when the police come to evict him - one is 100% on solid ground.  Many states have odd tenant rights, and while it sounds like that was not the original intention ( he as a tenant) that's what its become.  Good luck - this will be a small but meaningful fight in ones life to restore balance.  It's sad that some individuals just don't understand/can't understand that they must vacate.",

My sister was in a similar situation and she came back to her apartment absolutely destroyed. I\u2019m talking all the contents of her fridge and freezer dumped in her bathtub, heat turned up completely, everything she owned dumped everywhere.",

Those 30 days will pass either way.  Wouldn't it be better that with each day passing,  he's that much closer to having to leave,  if you don't find another way to get him out? Also many landlord/ tenant attorneys give free initial consultations.  You'll pick up some good advice going that and you may find that you may want to hire one of these lawyers. Make sure you give the ex his 30 day notice in the proper way",

Take those recordings to the cops, after saving them to a couple different places: email to an account he can\u2019t access; download to a computer, then a thumb drive, etc. Once the cops are in possession of the recordings, you can possibly get a judge to issue protective order that will cause him to have to vacate the house immediately.",

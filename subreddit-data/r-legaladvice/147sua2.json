    "postText": "Hello I have a 2011 chrysler 200 that has been run into the ground long story short it was overheating and now the engine is shot. The car is not worth buying a new engine for. I have 7k left on the 10k loan. I know I messed up not getting it fixed earlier, but I'm wondering what I should do at this point. Should I trade it in at the dealership? Find someone else to sell it to? Can insurance help at all?",

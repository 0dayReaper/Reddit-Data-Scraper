    "postText": "Hey! I need some advice and legal guidance on this: I\u2019m dealing with a ton and I don\u2019t know what to expect.\nSomeone made a report regarding me still living with my SA person 3 months ago, and I told them what happened. They filed the rest of the report and told me I cannot go live with my family again.\nSince then, I heard nothing until 3 weeks ago, they sent out a warrant immediately and he was arrested fast.\nHe\u2019s in jail right now, sitting on 2 felonies: Sexual assault of minor under 16 and sexual harassment of minor under 16.\nNow, he has a disability, it\u2019s narcolepsy. And it\u2019s a condition that causes him to have sleep attacks and sleeps at random times. He cannot go get a job, or function apart of society.\nWith this being the case: what should I expect?\nHe SAed me for 5 years, off and on as I moved around. From ages 8-13 years old. My family was aware but made excuses/took it as a joke.\nI\u2019m freaking out a bit, the preliminary hearing is in 2 days, and I have no clue on what to expect. They said I didn\u2019t need to attend.\nI\u2019m just freaking out, i feel like I\u2019m going to be in danger if he does go to jail. My grandma and my dad both have not been supportive, my grandma has been very hostile with me since the 3 months.\nWill he get off early? Will he not have to go to jail?\nMy brain is just going a bit crazy. I\u2019m sorry if this post seems scattered, I\u2019m really scared.\nMy family has been abusive to me for a very long time. Now with this all surfacing, I don\u2019t know what to do. And with the SA person, they need to be locked away for life. But I know he has a disability, and I feel like they will try to put blame onto that. He\u2019s around a ton of young children, teens, etc. I\u2019m so terrified for my sister, for her friends, for all of my cousins. And I\u2019m scared for me.\nWhat should I do? What can I do?\nAny feedback will be great help. It\u2019s currently 3am as I\u2019m writing this, if this post is confusing, I\u2019ll try to clarify some things.\nAny help will be amazing :)",

Is there like a time where it\u2019s too late for that? \nThe investigation is over and my SA person is already in jail, the way they explained it to me is the preliminary hearing is going to kind of set the course for the trial, if they have enough evidence then they\u2019ll just send him to jail, but if they don\u2019t, then it\u2019ll become an actual trial. So if there\u2019s a trial, then I should request one?",

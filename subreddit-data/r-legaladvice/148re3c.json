    "postText": "Hi. I need advice please. I bought an Ecoflow Delta 1300 when the company was a startup in 2020 paying $2500.00. a few days ago I plugged in a fan and it clicked like a fuse popped and it flashed an overload warning icon. I turned it off unplugged everything and now it won't reset even when nothing is plugged into it. I contacted the customer support who told me it had a2 year limited warranty. They will not help with any repair, exchange, or advise on what to do to reset it. I live in CA where the laws state implied warranty should be 4 years of I'm not mistaken. The only thing they offered was for me to return it for a gift certificate for $250 another purchase. That's ridiculous I paid 2500. What are my rights what can I do? Thank you",

There's no CA state law that says manufacturers have to warranty their products for 4 years. So if it's been more than 2 years you are SOL, you're out of warranty.",

No, you would definitely be mistaken.    If the manufacturer's warranty is 2 years, then you're on your own after it expires.",

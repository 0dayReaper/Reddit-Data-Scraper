    "postText": "Hi, I made this account today because I\u2019m really upset right now and I need to know if I have any grounds to get this man to experience any type of disciplinary action.\n\nI live in a small town in Wisconsin so the cops kind of know everybody. But there\u2019s this one cop who keeps pulling me over for the most craziest and asinine reasons like I was too close to the curb or I stopped too close to the stop sign. He\u2019s a young attractive cop and I\u2019m young and attractive as well so I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s trying to flirt with me or something? But the situations are so aggravating and the things he says and does seem like he\u2019s intentionally trying to antagonize me so that I\u2019ll say or do something out of anger and he\u2019ll have an excuse to escalate the situation.\n\nBut today he crossed the line. He pulled me over again under the guise that I wasn\u2019t going the speed limit (it was 45 I was going 50) and when he came to my car and said his usual bullshit in the most condescending way he said he had to search ME, not the car, because my car smelled funny. My car smells like vanilla and I\u2019ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he\u2019ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don\u2019t comply he\u2019ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin tight skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.\n\nI\u2019m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I\u2019m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?\n\nI have a GoPro in my car but idk if it caught this on camera I didn\u2019t check yet.",

If they have cause to search you or your vehicle, they will.  The only reason police will ask for you consent to search is because they don't have any other grounds to do so.  Follow all lawful instructions, don't argue, and don't answer any questions without a lawyer present.\n\n2) Gather all the information you have (times, dates, and such) and file a police report.  Do not agree to simply file some kind of internal complaint.  If they won't take the report, it's attorney time.  Don't threaten to call at attorney, just leave and go meet with one.\n\n3) Record everything.  Check if your phone will continue to record while it's locked.  If so, remove any kind automatic unlocking on your phone including face or fingerprint.  Passcode only.  Refuse to unlock your phone while it's recording.  Wisconsin is a single-party consent to record state.",

Have all that compiled ASAP.  \n\nNormally i wouldn't advocate for this, but I suggest you tell your city official as well. Councilmember, alderman whatever, mayor. Report it to the chief of police/sheriff immediately. If you can, have all your info in hand at the time of a report. City officials can help to light a fire under the departments ass to handle this guy. \n\nIf you're not bullshitting, what he did is inexcusable under any circumstance and is predatory behavior. It has escalated to the point it is becoming sexual battery (in my state that is). Ask his organizations department head for the officers name and d.o.b. to file charges. \n\nYou need to go to a court house to ban him from your residence. You need to file for a temporary order of protection.  You need to file for a restraining order. You need to file simple assault or sexual battery charges against him (depends on your state i dont live there.) \n\nIt sounds like a lot, but it is necessary. I've seen one guy do f'd up stuff like this and i burned him out of our agency. One did this to my mom and broke into our car and home when i was a kid. Wish you the best.",

Regardless of your state, all uniformed police conducting official business in a public place are subject to being recorded without their expressed consent. \n\nDo not give him or another leo a reason to arrest you. If ordered to exit a car, you have to comply legally. You might get legal advice from an attorney not to, if they say that follow your legal advice. Just understand failure to comply with a **lawful** order may get you temporarily jammed up.

Just because you don't have video doesn't mean that you don't have evidence. There should be enough information that you can recall (stone cold, facts only, dispassionately) so that when they cross reference your notes with his log it will demonstrate a trend.

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.998375 71/193rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

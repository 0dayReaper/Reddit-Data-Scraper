    "postText": "I had breast cancer about a year and a half ago. I got surgery and took FMLA. Luckily I didn\u2019t have to undergo chemo or radiation. Surgery was able to remove all my tumors. I still have check ups and screenings occasionally and have to miss work. Another coworker in another department has breast cancer but unfortunately was unable to hand it removed by only surgery and had to be out longer. She is still undergoing treatment. \n\nI declined reconstruction on my breasts so I was able to come back to work at 3 1/2 weeks. My FMLA is intermittent. I do take it occasionally for those check ups and screenings because I am at high risk of it returning. \n\nI have no breast on my left side (just a flat scar - no breast tissue) and I have no nipple and only a smaller amount of breast tissue on my right side (they removed a lot of breast tissue with a lumpectomy but were able to salvage about 55% of the breast tissue). I have no nipples. \n\nI did something very dumb because I am a very dumb person. \n\nMy coworkers and my immediate supervisor have been talking about my breast cancer for weeks because I had to miss an important meeting for a breast MRI and a bone scan. I requested off. Got my manager and HR to approve it. Converted under my FMLA signed by my oncologist. \n\nThey have been spreading rumors that because I came back to work so soon that I didn\u2019t have breast cancer. I wear a prosthetic at work so no one sees me flat. They are saying everyone they know with any cancer always has to take a lot of time off work and I seem fine. \n\nThey (coworkers and supervisor , not my manager or HR) are saying I am abusing FMLA. \n\nSomeone said they saw me out at the store (after an oncology appointment that was approved by my manager I did stop by the grocery store on my way home) and I looked fine. Again I am not on chemo so my appointments are check ups and blood draws. I feel fine after. They are emotionally draining but physical I feel great. \n\nIt got to the point where I was scared to even take appointments because I knew coming back to work would be the worst. Again, my manager has always been supportive and HR too. This is just my supervisor and my coworkers. \n\nI have a surgery coming up to help with some scarring. They are just going to clean up some of the tissue now that everything has healed and I have been cancer free for over a year. I let my supervisor know they are thinking about scheduling it for the summer and he said \u201cright the cancer thing again\u201d. \n\nOne particular day last week, I got upset because I heard them in the office next door talking about me. They were saying I was scamming everyone and that I didn\u2019t deserve the upcoming raises. About how I didn\u2019t have cancer. I got upset and I walked over and I lifted my shirt and prosthetic bra and showed them the scars on my chest. I did cover my remaining 55% there breast with no nipple with my hand but my scars were on display for all to see. \n\nI then told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my desk. This was on Friday at 3:30 pm. I left at 4:30 like I always do. No one has said anything. It is now Monday and I am worried. I had time to think over the weekend and realized it was a huge mistake. I should have just gone to HR about the gossip. \n\nI have seen my manager but they haven\u2019t said anything. My supervisor hasn\u2019t said anything. None of my gossiping coworkers have said anything. The ones that don\u2019t gossip haven\u2019t said anything and are acting like normal. \n\nWhat should I do to un-mess this up? What can I expect them to do to me legally? Could the coworkers I exposed my chest to call the police? My husband said they likely could but probably wouldn\u2019t. Do I get a lawyer now and ask his advice? Would I hurt myself more by going to my manager and HR and saying \u201c I messed up\u201d? I am so worried and confused. Any legal advice would be appreciate. I image if they did fire me something like this would keep me from unemployment right? I know they can legally fire me for any non protected reason and this isn\u2019t protected.",

This is an issue you would get a pass on, were you under my organization. You might get a verbal warning for your actions, but I would be unlikely to recommend termination. My job is to protect the organization- having an employee being harassed nonstop by a supervisor and then firing her for finally bending under that harassment is not a look that I or most organizations would want to take on. So, here is my real advice:\n\n1. Document. Every snarky comment, every snide look, everything. Who did it, when, what time, who witnessed it. You should have been doing this already to present to HR for a hostile work environment. If you haven't, document everything you can recall and keep it in case needed. Be factual and unemotional. No speculation about meaning just what was actually said and done.\n\n2. If HR calls you in on this particular case, again remain factually accurate. Be up front about what was said to you and your basis for eliminating the rumors. Do not answer what isn't asked. Don't overstate or overshare about your emotions or feelings. Leave those out. Then share your documentation from #1. \n\n3. If you are not called in to HR, say nothing at all. I would wager your supervisor and colleagues are probably more worried about what is coming to them right now for what they have been doing to you.\n\n4. If something actually does happen as a result, and you are terminated, I would seek legal input. And you will need documentation from 1 and 2. So if you are written up or terminated, ask specific questions about why and the more that is in writing the better.\n\n\nThanks for the gold!! And the silver!",

Since they're literally saying to not give you a raise, they are financially impacting you and can be taken to court over it. Document everything that you've heard, and roughly when, about people talking about you and prepare your documents from appointments (I'd argue whatever you gave HR to get the time off is acceptable). Take it to a lawyer who focuses on discrimination and/or harassment.\n\nSince you have no nipples, you're good enough for PG-13 tv, they can't get you in trouble for exposure. You can't expose what isn't there. Definitely look up toplessness laws in your state, to see if you are protected additionally.\n\nI'm glad you made it through this, OP. My wife had cancer last year so I know what you're going through. People forget that cancer doesn't mean you can go without groceries and replacement socks and paying bills.",

However, if you have the ability to talk to HR about the whole situation, do it. Get the gossip on record and explain that it was a heat of the moment thing. While you showed an area that is considered private, I doubt this will come back on you because nothing happened that would be considered sexual harassment. Be prepared for the people involved to try and avoid you for awhile out of embarrassment. This will blow over soon enough if you let it.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.992 13/71ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

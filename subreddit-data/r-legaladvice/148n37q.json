    "postText": "Is there a limit that park management can increase space rent during the sale of a mobile home? (California) current space rent is $550, proposed increase is $1000 for the new buyers. I think it will be tough to secure a buyer at this rate. Park has no real amenities and no utilities included in rent. Rent has only increased about $100 in the past 5 years of ownership.",

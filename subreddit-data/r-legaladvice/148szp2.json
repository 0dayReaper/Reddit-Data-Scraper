    "postText": "Today, I found out that I have a warrant for my arrest out of Jefferson County. I was assaulted on 08/29/2022 while working as an Emergency Room Tech at the Medical Center of Southeast Texas. I used physical force to defend myself during the attack. I filed charges against my attacker. The Port Arthur Police Department took my statement at the scene and advised me that the suspect was being arrested for assault. Some time later, a detective called me on the phone and asked me if I wanted to \"come down to the station and talk.\" I advised him that I did not wish to meet with him and that I made my statement to the officer on scene. When i asked him why it may be necessary to make another statement, he was very vague with his response. He never advised me that i was being investigated for a crime or that he was concerned about the truthfulness of my statement. I made my original statement immediately following the assault when I was hurt, scared, and fatigued as I was at the end of a twelve hour shift. I made my statement in good faith and to the best of my recollection. I have since moved to New Mexico as my wife and I have accepted jobs in the Albuquerque area. I learned of the warrant today while applying for a contractor pass to enter Kirtland Air Force base. I researched the matter today and was able to receive a copy of the warrant and the detectives signed affidavit. In the affidavit, the detective states that my statement did not match video evidence of the incident and that he attempted to give me an opportunity to \"change my statement.\" The charges were filled with the Jefferson County District Attorney on 01/11/2023 and the warrant was issued on 05/23/2023. I would not have intentionally lied to the officer. I had nothing to gain in doing so. If my perception of the event was not an exact match to the video, it was not done with malice or intent. I am a paramedic who has a good job for a great company. I have two neurodivergent children at home who need their father. I want help to resolve this issue.",

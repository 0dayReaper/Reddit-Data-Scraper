    "postText": "The incident happened in WA state. I was attacked by a dog yesterday while walking on the street, I believe the breed is german Shephard. I went to the urgent care because i got bites and scratches  on my leg and contacted local animal control officer. The claim is in the process. Tried to contact the house owner to get home owner insurance where the incident happened but I was threatened. What are my options? Police refused to come and they referred me to animal control officer. I know when, where it took place, I have pictures of my wounds. The owner of the dog ran off immediately and I got license plate of the car.\n\nI know that I need to get vaccination history of the dog but I don't have it now, not sure if rabies vaccination was done. What is the good lawyer to contact?\n\nTIA.",

            "comment": "You can search for a personal injury attorney, and often they will advertise if they handle dog bite cases.  If you hire an attorney, the insurance company will speak to your lawyer rather than you, and you will owe a portion of your settlement proceeds to the lawyer, typically about a third of the settlement.  It could be more if the matter goes to trial.",

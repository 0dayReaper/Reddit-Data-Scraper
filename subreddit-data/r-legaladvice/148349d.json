    "postText": "Hey everyone,  \nI could really use some guidance and insights regarding my loved one's situation in Ohio. He's been in prison for 5 years out of a 7-year sentence, and we recently received a denial for his judicial release application. We're feeling a bit lost and would greatly appreciate any advice or information from those familiar with Ohio's legal system.  \n1. Written Explanation for Denial: We're wondering if there's a rule or provision in Ohio law that requires or allows for a written explanation when a judicial release application is denied. Unfortunately, the denial we received didn't come with any specific reasons, and we're hoping to better understand the grounds for their decision.  \n2. Appeal Process in Ohio: If a written explanation isn't provided or if we believe there are valid grounds for an appeal, we're curious about the general process for filing an appeal in Ohio. Are there specific arguments or procedural aspects that we should consider? Any insights or experiences would be extremely helpful.  \n3. Bypassing the 60-day Waiting Period: After exploring options like requesting a written explanation and filing an appeal, we're wondering if there's any way to bypass the 60-day waiting period for a second judicial release application. We're open to exploring different avenues or circumstances that may allow for a more expedited consideration.  \nWe've already sought the advice of our attorney, but hearing from the Reddit community could provide valuable perspectives and she's soo hard to get in contact with soemtimes. :/  \nThank you all in advance for your guidance and support. I know aware this is not official legal counsel, but just looking for general information to better understand options. &lt;3  \nTake care and thanks again!\n\n**TL;DR: Seeking legal advice regarding a denied judicial release application in Ohio. Looking for information on obtaining a written explanation for the denial, the process for filing an appeal, and any potential ways to bypass the 60-day waiting period for a second application. Consulted an attorney but seeking additional insights and experiences from the Reddit community.**",

You absolutely shouldn\u2019t go back to your attorney with \u201csomeone on reddit said maybe\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve not given any details of circumstances or situation here.  Early release is, in most cases a long shot.  And in many cases the \u201cexplanation\u201d is something to the effect of \u201cI sentenced what I sentenced.\u201d",

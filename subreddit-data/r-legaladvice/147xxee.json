    "postText": "My friend was just pulled over last night and was charged with a DUI. He claims that he was taken in to the station and released that same night. Police impounded his car, offered to drive him home, and then they kicked him out of the car by some railroad tracks and beat him up.  He has bruises all over his face. A woman nearby heard him crying and yelling for help and ended up calling him an Uber to his home. His wife is the one who shared this story with me.  Who do we call? Who do we contact to report this? Is there actually anything that can be done??",

            "comment": "In most places, a person arrested for DUI who has their car impounded will be held overnight so they can sober up and be arraigned before release.\n\nIt is possible that police instead offered to drive him home, then assaulted and abandoned him.   This is, generally, neither good practice nor lawful conduct.\n\nIt is possible, even likely, that your friend's wife's story is inaccurate, exaggerated, or false.\n\n&gt;Who do we call\n\nFirst, he should call a DUI defense attorney to examine the arrest record and details, and plan to represent him in the DUI.\n\nIf there is evidence to support his claim that he was beaten by police, that attorney should help him find a civil rights attorney.",

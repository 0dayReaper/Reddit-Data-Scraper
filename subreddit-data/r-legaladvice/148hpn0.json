    "postText": "A work colleague was living with her male partner in a flat that is owned by her parents. He left her early this year and three months later (after not finding somewhere to live) he turned up at the property and, without any warning he let himself back into her flat with his keys and refuses to leave. He tells her that they are in a relationship (when she doesn\u2019t want to be) and hounds her every day to tell her how useless she is.\n\nHer confidence is destroyed and she expressed today that she wants to go to sleep and not wake up again.\n\nWhat can she do legally to get him out of the flat as safely as possible?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nShe lives in England ",

    "postText": "They say don't mix friends and money.  Looks like I am learning the hard way.    \n\n\nI would like opinion on how I should go about escalating -- ie do I contact a debt collection lawyer and let them handle it?    \n\n\nBackstory: Roughly 2 years ago, a friend reached out asking if I would invest with them..  They needed the capital, and would guarantee me a 25% return.  It's an industry I didn't/don't know much about (think buying and selling physical products at a markup -- all legal) and I expressed this, and the person gave their word there was no risk, and they would guarantee me the return, on their word.  I trusted them.    \n\n\nOver the course of 18 months, I ended up lending a large sum (low 6 figures), and throughout, this person was constantly reassuring me they would repay the sum.  They have repaid a portion, but still less than 10% of the outstanding balance.  I haven't applied any interest beyond the agreed upon 25% return, or gotten anyone else involved, but I need the money back.  They keep reassuring me they will pay, but I am at the point I can't trust them at their word, and need advice on how best to escalate, and let a professional handle it.    \n\n\nOther facts: there is no signed contract, only an archive of our messaging history going back to the start of the project.  There is a ledger I've kept of all transactions -- the person hasn't agreed to it, but says \"I feel there are things missing,\" without being able to point to any errors.  From what I understand, we need an official acknowledgement of the debt and a payment plan.    \n\n\nCan anyone please offer advice on how to approach this?  Would really appreciate any and all input.  (Yes I know I shouldn't have trusted them at their word and gotten this deep.  An expensive lesson).  \n\n\nThanks!  \n\n\ntl:dr -- lent friend large sum of money at promise of 25% guaranteed return.  Money still hasn't been given back, and I want to know the best way to escalate.",

How troubling may depend a bit by state. \n\n&gt;there is no signed contract\n\nAt this level of loan, that is *very* troubling.  One wonders a bit if your friend is going to call this a loan or something else.  \n\nThis is beyond internet advice.  And you're likely not looking for a \"debt collection law firm\" but a civil litigator.",

    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nIn the case of a deceased estate, how likely is it that the trustee will honour the wishes / bequests set out in the will when the nomination is non-binding? \n\nIn this scenario, I have been left a percentage of life insurance, however apparently the deceased wanted to protect his estate by locking it up with his superannuation. \n\nWhat he did not do was create a binding death benefit nomination and now I have been told that the trustee (superannuation fund) has discretion but not obligation to distribute to the beneficiaries noted in the will at this stage. \n\nBased on what I have been told - the super fund will usually pay only to the dependents (and carer / mother). How likely is it that the trustee will consider the bequests within the will in this case? (The deceased is my cousin). \n\nThanks in advance. ",

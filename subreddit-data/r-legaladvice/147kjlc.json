    "postText": "I\u2019m a 23 year old female, and I was a victim of sexual harassment at work a couple of months ago. I caught my shift leader taking videos of me in the women\u2019s bathroom. He was fired but this experience left me traumatized and paranoid. I started seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication for my anxiety and PTSD. (I have childhood trauma as well but it\u2019s not important in this case.) I started feeling the side effects of the medication, I was constantly tired and I couldn\u2019t focus at work. I was forced into a shift leader position since there wasn\u2019t anyone else who could\u2019ve taken that position. I never wanted it, in fact I\u2019ve been asking my boss to let me work 8 hours, since right now I\u2019m working 12 hour shifts and it is exhausting. I told my boss that I\u2019m taking medication due to the fact that I was sexually harassed and he told me I shouldn\u2019t take medication. I stopped taking them because I was scared I would get fired due to my lack of focus. A few days ago, I was having a night shift, alone. He drunk texted me, told me that this conversation should stay between us, then proceeded to tell me that me and a few other colleagues are \u201con the verge of being fired\u201d, which obviously scared me. He started a conversation with me which seemed innocent enough at first. I tried to be more open and communicative, since I\u2019m usually very quiet and don\u2019t really talk to people at work which bothers them. He told me that if I was there (he was at a team building that I refused to go to), we would be drinking together. I told him that I start being quite extroverted after a beer and he wanted to know what the \u201creal me\u201d is like. This is where the conversation started going downhill. He told me to go somewhere and buy a beer. I reminded him that I\u2019m at work and I shouldn\u2019t be drinking. He kept telling me to do it but I didn\u2019t. He then told me that if I was there, he would take me on a walk where no one can see us and kiss me. I tried to reject him nicely and most importantly I tried to make him realize that he\u2019s making a mistake. I reminded him that he has a family, a wife and children, that he\u2019s drunk and he shouldn\u2019t be doing this. He kept doing it anyway then told me \u201cthe fact that you rejected me makes me want to do it even more\u201d and told me that one night he will come into the office when I\u2019m alone so we can drink. He did come in one night which scared me and he said \u201cif I knew you were working, I would\u2019ve bought some beer.\u201d He didn\u2019t do anything apart from sitting way too close to me, but he creeps me out and I feel very uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been thinking about sending an email to my manager but they\u2019re good friends and I\u2019m scared that somehow they will blame me. I would send an email to our HR representative but she quit a few months ago and the only person I could go to is the head of HR, but I feel silly going to someone with such a high position. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m scared of going to work, I\u2019m constantly worried, crying and I often have panic attacks. I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t take it seriously cause his words are worth more than mine. I of course have the conversation and pictures of the conversation as well, but I\u2019m still scared. I\u2019ve been thinking about talking to an attorney, but I\u2019m not sure what is the right thing to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

            "comment": "In my opinion, your instincts are right, this is attorney territory... Someone in a position of authority over you is making unwanted advances very shortly after a different incident. That's not okay. I would be inclined to at least speak to an attorney but at the very least you want to go to the HR person, like as high up on the chain as you can go.",

    "postText": "So I live in PA, I won a car worth roughly $65k via a give away from a social media influencer. The car is coming from texas. \n\nCar is on its way to me as I type. Said influencer is going to give me a bill of sale and paid in full letter. They will be labeled as \u2018gift\u2019 under the total paid.\n\nHe had said that I will be on the hook for the sales tax on the value of the car since texas does not reciprocal agreement with PA. \n\nDoes this all sound right? Im fine paying the sales tax for this car as im still way up over all.",

            "comment": "There are a couple of things that concern me here:\n\n1: Anytime you win a prize that has a value over $600 you are responsible for taxes. For a vehicle, this will include state sales tax and vehicle title and registration fees.\n\n2: This is where I am concerned - a new vehicle has to be titled before it can leave the lot and delivered to an owner. A bill of sale, listed as a gift does not sound legitimate or above board. Any legit entity that is giving away a car would not proceed in this manner. The car has to be delivered by a dealership. Before the vehicle can leave the lot it has to be titled to someone and the person who is issued the first title is responsible for taxes and fees and the dealership will collect the taxes and fees before delivery can take place. So the dealership that is facilitating the delivery of the vehicle should have reached out to you to complete the paperwork needed to title and register the vehicle before it can leave the lot for delivery.\n\nThis whole story sounds like a scam. I have been in the auto industry for 20+ years and partnered with many charities over the years to give away cars as part of a fundraiser and we never handled the transaction in this manner. So before you get too excited, stay skeptical. Don't send anyone any money if they ask. If a car does arrive, check the title immediately. Find out who it is titled to and make sure the title has been signed over to you. Check all the paperwork. All the paperwork should be from a legit auto dealer and easily verified. Don't give out your personal information. If possible, see if you can arrange delivery at a near by dealership. For example, if you won a BMW ask them to deliver it to the closest BMW dealer. Ask the influencer what dealer is facilitating the delivery. For example, if you are getting a BMW get the name of the BMW dealership and don't call the dealer, call BMW directly. All new vehicles have to be registered with the OEM to initiate the warranty coverage. If you give them the name of dealership, they can easily access the new vehicle registration system and see if a new car has been registered to you through that deaership.",

In addition to whatever sales tax you might owe, you will need to declare the value of the car as ordinary income and pay income tax on it. For many people winning a car, that means as a practical matter, they need to immediately sell it to raise sufficient cash to pay taxes on the large amount of non-liquid income.",

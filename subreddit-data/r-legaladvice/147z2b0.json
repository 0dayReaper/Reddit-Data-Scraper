    "postText": "I was working at an employer full-time with benefits (health, dental, and vision insurance) and had left voluntarily.  \n\nI left on good terms, i.e. no gross misconduct.\n\nThis employer had fewer than 20 employees, but more than 2.  \n\nGiven all of this I should be eligible for Cal-COBRA. When I left this employer, I was planning to use Cal-COBRA for my health insurance, I would continue my coverage via Cal-COBRA.  \n\n\nI left the employer on March 31, 2023.  I hadn't received my Cal-COBRA notice by May 16, 2023, so I emailed the ex-employer on that date.  I received a quick response saying that my coverage was canceled on May 10th. So at this point I was expecting the Cal-COBRA notice within a few weeks.  \n\n\nAs of today, June 12, 2023 , I have not received any notice about Cal-COBRA.  And I emailed this employer last week to ask them what the status was, they haven't responded.  I have a feeling, for whatever reason, that they did not follow the proper steps to have my Cal-COBRA option sent out.  However I cannot get in touch with them.    \n\n\nI called my insurance, they said my status was \"inactive\".  That's when I had emailed the former employer.  \n\n\nSo I supposed my questions are:  \n\\* I am eligible for Cal-COBRA, correct?  \n\\* If so, how can I follow-up to ensure the former employer has followed the necessary steps? What if the employer chooses to not respond again? Should I contact a lawyer?  \n\n\n  \nThis employer is in San Francisco, CA and I live in San Mateo County, CA at the moment.",

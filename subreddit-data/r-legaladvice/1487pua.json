    "postText": "I have a friend who is a mentally handicapped adult who lives off of disability. Long story short, they got a significant other online and were together for four years. The relationship seemed ok until I learned that their SO was asking for money the past year from the person's disability money.\n\nThe SO agreed to pay it back but has since taken over $1k and has ghosted my friend. I'm wondering if there is any protection against this?\n\nThe friend is on the spectrum and doesn't always read situations for what they are. The ex-SO is from the US, and we know their address. Is there anything that can be done, or is the money a lost cause?\n\nFrom what I know, there are receipts of the friend sending the money, but the agreement of the paying back was made on a phone call. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

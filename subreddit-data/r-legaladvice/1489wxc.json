    "postText": "I was falsely accused of sexual harassment by someone I had a consensual flirtatious relationship with at work. \n\nI am writing a statement in response to hers and do believe that the CCTV which will be retrieved of her flirting with and touching my body should exculpate me pretty well. However I wonder if I should also explain what I think the motive behind her lying should be. \n\nI think the reason for her filing this complaint is not really due to her own volition, but due to her abusive and jealous partner who had it in for me, despite him saying he was ok with her fooling around with other women (we are two women). She also has borderline personality disorder which can cause people to spread lies and ruin the careers of others.\n\nDo I need to prove a motive for her lying, or just that it was consensual the whole time and that she is lying?",

You don't need to show mens rea or provide a motive for the jury.\n\nJust tell them you believed the relationship was consensual, provided any evidence you have to back that up and leave it at that. \n\nKeep in mind if some of that CCTV footage of someone \"touching you in a flirtatious manner\" may not be interpreted the way you think it will be. It could also be considered grounds for dismissal all by itself.",

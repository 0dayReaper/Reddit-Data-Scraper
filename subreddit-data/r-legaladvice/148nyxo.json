    "postText": "So my wife and I live in California so laws might be different to other places. We lived at our complex for 3 years so we expected some security deposit back. We moved out of the complex on March 31st 2023 and we gave them our months notice on February 18th 2023. We did everything right giving the keys back and writing down our forwarding address on the exit form and placed them all on their desk.\n\nTwo weeks later in April we were wondering why the security deposit hadn\u2019t come yet and low and behold, they sent the deposit to their own mail room at our old mailbox, which we obviously couldn\u2019t access. They said they lost our forwarding address but they didn\u2019t even try to contact us with the contact information they had on file from we lived there for 3 years.\n\nThen over the next months until a couple weeks ago we\u2019ve been calling them every couple or few days and they have the same response \u201cour community manager isn\u2019t in right now, leave your number and we\u2019ll have her call you back\u201d. Surprise surprise, they never called us back and they keep forgetting about us.\n\nWe were never provided any form of billing or documentation on what our security deposit would be.\n\nWe\u2019re going to try to go to Small Claims court this weekend but don\u2019t know the proper procedures nor what we should bring to help our case. Any advice is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Not a lawyer, not legal advice. \n\nYes, small claims court is the correct recourse here. You should list damages as the amount of 3x your security deposit (I believe it's 3x in California, but please look up the law yourself). You should bring documentation of every contact you've had with them, ideally copies of letters, phone logs, lease, and documentation of move-in/move-out condition in case they still try to deduct (I don't think it's possible at this point though). Write a timeline of all communication and attempted communication and actions related to move out and security deposit.\n\nYou can also try sending them a demand letter first saying if you haven't received a check at your new address by such and such date (give them like 5 business days) then you will take them to small claims court for damages in the amount of 3x your security deposit (cite the law that says this is the penalty). Send it certified mail. This might motivate them to send it back, but then you couldn't sue them for the 3x damages (I think). They are required to make a good faith effort to return the security deposit as long as you sent a forwarding address, and \"x employee is out\" or \"we sent it to the wrong address\" is not a legal excuse. Courts in California like to side with tenants here and it sounds like you have a strong case.\n\nGood luck, and don't let your landlord steal your money!",

    "postText": "My last day was back in May. I wasn\u2019t given any notice and was not able to complete changes for my main project. Now that I\u2019m unemployed my contracting agency keeps asking for more and more information about my project so they can complete it and said my manager needs this information before he can send my last paycheck. I have already given them the login to my work laptop so they have everything they need. Apparently it is not enough as they are still asking for more information. The craziest part is I had just enough time left in my contract (1 mo) to complete all my work and properly transfer knowledge to whoever needed it, but it was cut short. Now because my manager didn\u2019t plan well enough I am being hurt twice. Is this legal for him to do? What course of action can I take for this?",

If they still want your help, send them your hourly Consulting Fee.\n\nFederal Law: If the regular payday for the last pay period an employee worked has passed and the employee has not been paid, contact the Department of Labor's\u00a0Wage and Hour Division\u00a0or the\u00a0state labor department.\n\nThe Department also has mechanisms in place for the recovery of\u00a0back wages.\nhttps://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/lastpaycheck\n\n\n\nGeorgia: Georgia state law does not offer any specific guidance as to how and when an employee\u2019s final paycheck must be delivered after they are let go from a company.

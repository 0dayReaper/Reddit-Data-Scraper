    "postText": "I bought a used car in late Feb. Went through an established dealership, not a fly-by-night place. Financed through my bank, not the dealer financing.\n\nAs per usual, the dealer provided paper temporary tags and supposedly filed the paperwork for registration, title, permanent license plates.\n\nThe paper tags expired in April (60 days after purchase). Over the course of about 10 days in early May, I called the dealership several times, left messages, was passed around to different people who promised but failed to call me back, finally reached someone who could help. They told me that they had not received the title yet, made excuses about being short-staffed, but sent me out another set of paper tags good for 30 days. Those tags expire this week.\n\nOver the weekend, I received a letter from my bank dated 5/31 that they have not received the title. Per the letter, if they do not receive it by the end of this month, my loan is in default.\n\nI called the dealership today. This morning I was connected to the title office and left a message on a voicemail. This afternoon I called again, was connected to a live person who finally gave me some information. According to this person on the phone, there is an issue with the previous title, the lien holder has not released it so they cannot file for a new title. This person promised to follow up with the previous lien holder today to get it released, and call my bank on my behalf to tell them the situation. She also promised to get me another set of temporary tags so I'm not driving around with expired tags. She made it sound like a paperwork issue that would be quickly rectified now that she's aware of it.\n\nI don't have a lot of trust in the dealer at this point and will be following up tomorrow via phone. If it goes much longer, I will drive to the dealership and make a pest of myself in person, but that's an hour away and difficult to do during business hours. I would rather not take the time off work if I don't have to.\n\nIf the previous lien holder has not released the previous title, does that mean the dealership did not have the legal right to sell this vehicle at all? Seems like that should have been taken care of when they bought the car from the previous owner.\n\nIf they are not able to get a title to the bank and permanent license plates to me by the end of the month, what recourse do I have against the dealership?\n\nWhat rights do I and my bank have in this situation regarding my loan?\n\nCan I force the dealership to cancel the deal and refund my money (less a reasonable amount for effectively renting the car for several months)? I have already made several payments on the loan.",

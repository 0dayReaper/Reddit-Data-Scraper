    "postText": "I'm currently trying to obtain a copy of my medical records from a private practice and was informed that they charge for providing a copy. This office is in Pennsylvania so they specifically referenced the per-page fee structure shown [here](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Administrative/Pages/Medical-Record-Fees.aspx). I'm very much out of my depth here but it honestly makes no sense to me that I would have to pay for a copy of my own medical record, especially if it can be provided electronically and does not need to be printed out. However if it does need to be printed out, the cost per-page structure laid out seems very exorbitant considering printer paper costs about $0.02/page. The [HHS website](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/medical-records/index.html) states that \"a provider may charge for the reasonable costs for copying and mailing the records. The provider cannot charge you a fee for searching for or retrieving your records.\" Personally, would characterize the costs per page given as unreasonable. However, if I am able to get an electronic copy would I then have a case for any fees to be waived since fees for searching and retrieving cannot be applied?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn talking with the office I was also told that there is no fee if the records are being sent to a different doctor. Having it be free in that case but not free if I want a copy of my own records seems ridiculous but I'm not sure if I have any legal grounds to argue that those two cases should not be treated differently.",

If you would like a copy of something that belongs to them, it's reasonable to charge you for the labor involved in providing you with that service.\n\nIt is perfectly legal and customary to waive the fee for sending records to another medical provider. The provider needs those records to provide prompt and informed care and both giver/receiver are already set up for HIPAA compliance, etc.",

Fees are waived for other providers because the records are necessary and because practices want that same courtesy extended to them. It may cost $0.02 per page for ink and paper, but someone is also standing there physically copying/ printing the record, so that reasonable fee extends to paying for their time as well.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m in Washington state and I\u2019m in a pickle, my current employer, who I will label CE, (a school district) reached out to my previous employer, who I will label PE, to confirm the length of my employment with them. In response to this request, PE emailed over a year and a half worth of my paystubs as confirmation of my time working with them which didn\u2019t cover my entire time with them to begin with but also was weird to the HR department at CE. I was never contacted by PE about this and never consented.\n\nHR with CE reached out to talk to me about some other matters and then told me about what happened and stated that it was weird and she had never had this happen before, but she assured me all the paystubs were in a confidential folder and no one else would see them. She also told me I was more then welcome to come stop by and look over it when I had time.\n\nThis whole situation is weird to me as I\u2019ve never had a previous employer do something like this, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s okay or not?",

            "comment": "Sometimes employees do give permission for this when they are hired. As part of orientation they may be asked to sign a form stating they do not wish the employer to verify employment or they do wish the employer to verify employment including dates and rate of pay.\n\nI've seen some really weird requests from prospective employers too. \"Hey, we interviewed Jane Doe and are considering her for employment. If you drug tested her, would you please forward her drug test results to us?\" \n\nNot sure why CE even told you about it. \n\nIt's generally not illegal to disclose rate of pay. If the pay stubs included your full SSN, that's not ok.",

Why would any employer want written verification/proof of what the pay rate was? That's unheard of. The previous employer probably voluntarily sent them which is a problem. Information, which is nobody else's business, is on a paystub!",

    "postText": "To avoid confusion since my parents were a lesbian couple, my biological mother will be S and my other mom will be R.\n\n\nWhen I was very young my grandfather passed away, in his will he left me his 80s Corvette. I\u2019m not a car person and neither are my parents so the car basically sat in our driveway for years untouched. When I was around 8 or 9 my parents convinced me to sell the car since the money would serve me better. I agreed and we got $3000 for it (I\u2019ve been told by many in my life that we could\u2019ve gotten way more for the car, but from what I remember the paint was flaking off, it needed several new parts and it smelled like cigarettes, so maybe that devalued it but idk). We then opened a savings account with R as the customary owner and my name on it as well (idk how exactly it worked but I was under 18 and she held control over it, that simple). \n\nFor the next few years I started earning allowance from my parents which was periodically deposited into the savings account, by the time I was 15 it had accumulated to a little under $6000. One night S\u2019 car was towed from our driveway since she had missed a payment, she told me she had to take some money out of the account in order to get the car back. I said it was fine since she is a physician and I have three younger siblings that need to go to school. Around this time my parents started having trouble in their marriage, and R also started taking money out of the account as S was putting it back in. Eventually S figured this out and started paying me back in a separate account, she eventually payed back her share. But R continued to take money out of it and never told me about it, all I got was a half hearted apology and an empty promise to pay it back. Eventually R moved out once the divorce was finalized and due to a straining relationship, I quit visiting her when I was 17 and have basically cut her off completely (there were other reason besides the money). \n\nI\u2019m now 19 and according to the last bank statement I got, there\u2019s $20 left in the account. I got into an argument with her last Christmas about it and she put $300 in, but that has obviously since been taking out. My question is do I have grounds to sue or take her to small claims and win? Since half the money was technically my grandfathers and the other half I earned, my concern is that since I was a minor and she was the owner of the account there isn\u2019t much I can do. And because the car was willed to me and not the money that also is a tricky situation. I\u2019m not a legal expert and have no idea if I can even do anything about this, so any help/advice is appreciated.",

    "postText": "I have worked for a large company for 4 years. I am the insurance holder for my spouse and family. I carry medical and dental. My spouse at his previous job would carry a secondary dental because why the hell not it saves money. My spouse left his job to work for my employer. We assumed it was fine if again we picked up secondary coverage for dental. After 4 months they sent a legal sounding email stating this was against the plan rules and we would have to drop the secondary dental. It was actually in the plan documents (not for delta dental for my employer). I had multiple appointments with HR who gave every stupid excuse why we aren't allowed. First they acted stupid and said you just plain can't dual coverage anywhere and I let them know that was a load. Then they said that it was because it would be unfair to other employees, that it would seem like we were being favored. That, I insisted, was the opposite of what was happening all the other married employees can get dual coverage if their spouse doesn't work here. Then they said that it made more work for the insurance company and they were attempting to keep them from doing double the paperwork. I advised that delta has a whole page on how you can dual coverage and why it's beneficial. They eventually wore me down, they just leaned back on it was in their paperwork. Is this legal? Seems to me discrimination or at least fair pay/compensation/equity issue but I could be way off base.",

    "postText": "Facts:\n\n* Seven year old car - full service history in accordance with manufacturers schedule.\n* Since learned that the car model has known issue with cam belt failing early (recommended change at 140K miles). Premature failure common after 80K miles.\n* Cam belt on car fails at 90K miles - engine written off.\n* A year ago the same car had an oil blockage cleared by a franchised main dealer and the detailed job sheet cited \"Blockage due to fibres from cam belt\".\n* Nowhere on job-sheet does it state that the belt was inspected, nor was I advised to change the belt.\n\nGiven that fibres from the belt were identified as the root-cause of the oil blockage, and there is no evidence to support that a full inspection of the belt was carried out, could I argue that the dealership has failed to carry out the work with due diligence? \n\nThe root cause was positively identified i.e. fibres from cam belt (known indicator of belt disintegration) yet they only fixed the symptom i.e. the blockage, leaving the root cause to get worse, to the point that the belt failed prematurely.",

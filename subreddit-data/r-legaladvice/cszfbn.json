    "postText": "Located in Oklahoma, USA\n\nMy sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. \n\nThe principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.\n\nUpdate: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. Thank you to the people who were helpful!",

If this is true,  you can definitely escalate it by talking to the principal, then the school board. \n\nMost schools have a procedure for visitation, so you can request a copy of that to see if it's been violated. \n\nYou need to ask yourself what the desired outcome is here.  Do you want to get the staff member, most likely the secretary, who allowed the visitation fired? Are you trying to sue the school for damages? Or,  do you simply want grandma not to be allowed to visit?\n\nIf it's the latter, I would be highly surprised if the school didn't honor your request. If they don't, you'll need to get some sort of legal documentation, like a restraining order, to keep her from visiting.\n\nMy advice would be to talk to the teacher.  Be honest with her about the situation, and ask for help. Teachers have the most direct impact on their students. So, if you explain to the teacher the harm this is causing your niece, the teacher most likely will be able to intervene on your behalf. Teachers have the best interest of their students in mind and can help facilitate difficult situations.",

Seriously - how long does the list need to be? Because that list should have everyone in the world on it BUT the parents, right? You see how backwards that is? That's why it's the other way around.",

The visitor list is opt-out, so if there are specific people (or all non-parents) you don't want visiting your children during lunch or other times you have to give them that information.",

Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. \n&gt; \n&gt; The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.6319918 &amp; 17/64ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.6319918 &amp; 17/64ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

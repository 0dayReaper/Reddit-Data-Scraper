    "postText": "Hello! For the past 18 months my partner and I were living in an apartment in Michigan. Two weeks after we left, the landlord asked us to come by and do a deep cleaning on the kitchen (oven, fridge, cabinets) because there is a \"spice smell\" in the kitchen area (I am an avid home chef). To be clear, he says it smells of spices, not rotting food. We plan to go back today to do the cleaning and see if we can alleviate the odors. But, in case the smell doesn't go away, is he within his rights to bill us (deduct money from security deposit) for any measures taken to professionally remove the odor? It's not like I was using the appliances/kitchen improperly. He does not have any kitchen ventilation installed in the unit as a preventative measure. This seems more like a wear and tear type of issue to me. .. Thoughts?",

Or materials that wear down with normal use like a drawstring blind. \n\nYes if he hires someone to remove odors he can bill you for it. Similar if you had a pet and a pet left a smell even if you cleaned up after it.",

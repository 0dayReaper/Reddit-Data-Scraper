    "postText": "To preface, honestly wouldn\u2019t care if my boss wasn\u2019t such a dick, as the 30 minutes would be unpaid anyways. But he is a dick, and we don\u2019t even get 15s.\n\nIn California. Started working at this job at the beginning of this year. For context it is an alternative/smoke shop (cigarettes, bongs, cleaning supplies, drug test kits, the like) and our main shift duties include making sales and making sure the shop is clean and presentable.\n\nHe calls us off the clock for work related reasons, has us make the monthly/weekly schedules (none of us have managerial positions), has us log our own hours and send them in every pay period (which he never pays on time, always get our money at least a day late), and sometimes verbally harasses a handful of employees (only the ones he doesn\u2019t like).\n\nRecently he stopped scheduling mid-shifts under the guise that he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it because we aren\u2019t making enough (maximum of 3 people working a day, 93 dollars per day per person, $279 total. We make AT LEAST double that in net sales daily). So now for 6 days out of the week an opener and a closer will work their entire 6 hour shift alone.\n\nHe has the audacity to call us (and sometimes verbally harass us) when we \u201carent doing enough around the store\u201d (AKA sitting down and taking a break), but has yet to give any of us breaks. It\u2019s been like that (no breaks) since before I started working there.\n\nVery close to quitting but want to get my lick in. Is there anything I can do? I am also not 21  so I\u2019m not even sure if legally I am allowed to be working there, and if any of that would fall back on me if I am able to take this to court.",

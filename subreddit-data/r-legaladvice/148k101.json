    "postText": "I ordered clothing from company, I will not name. I ordered a few. They all came in individual plastic wrapping and with tags. One of them though, the clothing tag had little spots over it and even the back of it. It looked like black mold or black ink. But now looking more into it, it seems to be black mold. The black coloring even got on the clothing, (which of course just had to be white). Can I sue the clothing company for this? If so, how do I go about this? Thanks!",

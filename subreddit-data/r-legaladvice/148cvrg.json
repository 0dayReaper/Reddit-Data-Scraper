    "postText": "COUNTRY - India \nI was an intern for an immigration consultancy company and wrote about 7 articles everyday for articles in 2 weeks (working days - Monday to Saturday, 9 am to 6:30 PM) The actual employed content writer was writing 3 articles a day. Her salary was 45k and mine was 14k.\nThe employees were all about 5-6 months old even though the company was 12 years old, the HR was the owner\u2019s sister. Should\u2019ve taken it as a red flag but i was only there as an intern, not my problem.\nBut then,\nthe people there told me how they have a habit of firing people before salary date to avoid salary payment. I worked there for 2 weeks WITHOUT an offer letter, a letter of intent etc. One week out of the two was my \u201ctraining period\u201d and i was told that after my training period i\u2019ll be given the offer letter.\nsure,\nso 4 days into my training period, they told me that i\u2019ve successfully passed it and i\u2019m employed now as an intern.\nStill didn\u2019t give me a letter.\nAfter about 15 days of working there, it was becoming fishy.\nI basically had no proof that i\u2019m interning there or employed, literally not even letter of intent.\nI mailed the HR, she said i will meet you on tuesday \non tuesday i talked to a junior of HR he said mail her again, LIKE BRO??? \ni was like sure, \nthen she told me i will meet on friday.\nFriday would\u2019ve marked my 20th day there.\nthe internship was for A MONTH. \nshe called me and said it takes time to make an offer letter and i should give her 8 days, as if i wasn\u2019t already working there for 15 days.\nThen I told her i want to resign, this is unfair and i\u2019m doing free work without guarantee and she said you can\u2019t resign only i can fire you.\ni said then do it and she said finish work and pack things.\n\nBut i\u2019ve already done so much work, what should i do?? will they pay?? they won\u2019t reply to call or messages.",

    "postText": "Writing on behalf of someone else. \n\nI am curious what rights domestic partners have to pet ownership when one partner dies and a will is not in place. \n\nTwo individuals filed for a domestic partnership (CA, 2018). Their relationship ended, and they both moved out of state. One partner took ownership of their shared pets. Unfortunately this partner has died. The other partner now wants to secure ownership of the pets, but there was no will or trust in place with instructions re: estate or pet ownership. They also had not dissolved the domestic partnership. \n\n1) Has the domestic partnership ended due to one partner passing? Or does this still need to be dissolved by the surviving partner?\n2) Does the surviving partner have any rights to pet ownership due to death of the other partner? \n3) How should the surviving partner go about confirming that no will or estate was created in the separation period?",

However, they had not dissolved their domestic partnership with the person who I am writing on behalf of. So I'm not sure if the next of kin would be the surviving partner or the elder parents?",

If they say no, you probably need an attorney in that state who specializes in estates (there are usually many). They'll probably start by sending a strongly worded letter, then could challenge the estate in court",

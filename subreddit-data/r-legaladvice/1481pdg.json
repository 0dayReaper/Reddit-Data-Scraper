    "postText": "Kid has dyslexia (learning disability), disfluency (stuttering), and ADHD diagnosed by private professionals. School established a speech IEP but is refusing to modify for the dyslexia and ADHD diagnoses (these diagnoses came later). School agreed to subpar accommodations for dyslexia and ADHD but not in legal document (just orally and via email). Refusing a 504 bc of the speech IEP. Refusing to cancel or modify the speech IEP. Refusing to meet over the summer. Claiming his average scores on standardized testing disqualifies him from an IEP for dyslexia. \n\nQuestions for those knowledgeable in this area of fed law (and NV law \ud83e\udd1e): \n\n1. Can you modify the speech IEP to maintain speech services and include extensive accommodations for dyslexia and adhd? \n\n2. If #1 is no, can you add a 504 for accommodations for dyslexia and adhd?\n\n3. If # 1 and 2 are no, how would you proceed? \n\n4. How do you get a school to accept an diagnosis from a private provider (neuropsychologist) in light of average test scores?\n\nStudent, my kid, is currently in private therapies for both dyslexia and adhd and will start private therapy for speech next month. He is scoring average despite his disabilities. The kids is smart. I simply want accommodations in writing pursuant to fed and state law to protect his rights and put on equal ground with his classmates. He is in second grade. \n\nFull disclosure- I am a patent attorney and I\u2019m trying to read the law on all this but I thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask. \ud83d\ude42 Any other advice/thoughts/opinions/questions welcome.",

            "comment": "It's possible to have both an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and a 504 plan, but it would be unlikely for your child to need both. This is because that everything that's in a 504 plan can be included in an IEP. The IEP can also provide services and supports that would not be available in a 504 plan. While they have said no to dyslexia, what is their reasoning for not adding the ADHD to the plan? My son has a 504 for ADHD and higher than average scores at school - but a 504 is more behavioral and accommodations than an IEP.  An IEP is more for individual services mostly related to special education - and some issues such as autism, deafness, your kids speech issues, etc.",

And they aren\u2019t receptive to canceling the speech IEP. This is why I\u2019m trying to figure out what my son is legally entitled to, how everything works together, etc., because I feel like the school is being obstructionist. At the first meeting we had, the school psychologist said dyslexia isn\u2019t a disability but a general term that means someone cannot read well. None of what the school is saying makes any logical sense at all.",

I don't want to post a link that is against the rules, but definitely bring up IDEA 2004 and ask where it says that it can only be for one. Hint: It doesn't!",

    "postText": "In 2018 I went to look at an Apartment for college students. Before even looking at the sample space, the tour guide asked me to sign a paper which she specified was not a Lease, and was just a precaution for the apartment in case anything happened to it while I was looking at it.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve finally gotten around to checking my credit report and it says I have a collections out for my name for $9100! When I figure out who was responsible for the collections, I called the apartment complex and told the manager my situation. She told me what I had signed was in fact a lease, and though I had never even seen the actual apartment, I was responsible for payment. She also emailed me a copy of the \u201cLease\u201d that I signed, and it doesn\u2019t even have my actual signature. It just has my name typed in cursive font at the bottom of all 9 pages..\n\nI know for sure that I did not sign all those papers because obviously I would\u2019ve seen that it says \u201cRental Agreement\u201d at the top. Plus, my \u201csignature\u201d isn\u2019t even a signature. It\u2019s literally my name typed out in cursive font at the bottom of each page. Anybody could\u2019ve typed that out.\n\nWhat can I do?.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

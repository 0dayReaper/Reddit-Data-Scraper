    "postText": "Hello,\n\nFirst reddit post in 7 years so please bare with me.\n\nI'm currently in the process of buying a wedding dress. After an exhaustive search I managed to find a dress I like but after agreeing to purchase they mailed over a contract that sends up red flags in my mind and I could use advice on how to proceed. \n\n\"I acknowledge that the product(s) I purchased are 'SAMPLE' product(s) which may have wear and tear and stains. The Product(s) are being sold as-is. I have inspected the product(s) and I am satisfied with the condition. Further, I agree to hold Company\u2019s Name harmless for any reason about this purchase now, or in the future. All sales are final. No returns allowed.\"\nI have not seen the dress in a week so I can't be certain what state it's in as it's an off the rack dress.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that the merchandise I have purchased does not include a warranty, either expressed or implied. I allow Company Name and affiliated companies to use any photos taken of me and my party for marketing purposes.\"\nThe warranty part I'm ok with signing but I'm not ok with them using any pictures of me for marketing and putting on their website. I also found it discomforting that they put the 2 parts together in this. Can I cross out the photos part and initial for the warranty part?\r\n\r\n\"lf I breach this contract and Company Name needs to take legal action, I agree to pay all Company Name legal fees associated with the case.\"\nIf the dress has any new damages from the week that I've seen it there is another clause that says all sales are final for off the rack items and there are \"no refunds, exchanges, or cancellations\", so if they mess up what happens? Am I legally bound to pay for their legal fees?\n\nAppreciate any input or suggestions.  I'll do my best to reply to any follow questions you guys have as promptly as possible. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Am I legally bound to pay for their legal fees?\n\nIf *you* mess up, that's what they are saying. How enforceable this is may be dependent on your location.\n\nWhat here do you not agree with? Also, if you move forward, see if you can wait to sign until you have the dress in hand.",

It's been a week since I've seen it and though unlikely it got damaged I don't want to pay all this money for damaged goods. \n\nEspecially since there is no refunds, cancelations or exchanges in the contract",

You would need to negotiate with them to remove this clause.\n\n&gt; Am I legally bound to pay for their legal fees?\n\nThey're saying that if they need to sue you, you are going to pay their fees.",

Your signature would give them automatic permission to use the photos with no recourse from you.\n\nYou can't cross out any terms that you don't agree with.  That does nothing to legally change anything.\n\nGet the name of the dress and/or a photo and shop around for dupes of the dress or see if other bridal shops might carry it.",

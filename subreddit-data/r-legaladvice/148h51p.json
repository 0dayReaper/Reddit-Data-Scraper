    "postText": "My ex and I had gone through a divorce. We have a child together. She has lied multiple times under oath to the judge. The judge believes her ans has sided with her. I have tried to make changes to the parenting plan but the judge favors her and gives her what she wants. She has caused me so much anguish with refusing to see my child and caused immense financial strain. She even tried to out me in jail for all of it.",

You\u2019re not going to get a \u201cgolden bullet\u201d answer on here.\n\nI would recommend contacting the state bar association and asking what legal aid programs there are for family law matters. You may qualify for low or no cost representation depending on the circumstances and availability. Or you might not. There\u2019s no way for us to know online. Oh yeah, you might also contact some local law schools to ask if they have a family law clinic where you could get a student attorney (supervised by an actual attorney).",

They stated that proving mental manipulation is difficult unless you have evidence during the time it's being committed.",

I have roughly 20gbs of data varying ever form of recording to text/emails of her lying. It took me at least a month to sort and organize the proof of lies. \n\nHe more or less got annoyed about the situation and ended the trial shortly because he was annoyed with my long answers. When she lied on the stand, I had asked to present a video of her lying under oath. He told me not to worry about it and dismissed the court. A month and a half later, he ruled against me. \n\nI even tried to show the judge that she was in contempt of court for failing to abide by the court ordered parenting plan. I have a police dept willing to back me up stating that she tried to fabricate evidence against me. It's crazy how much she lies to everyone. Her end goal is to cut me out of her life regardless on how my child feels. She's even been talking bad about me to my child to the point my daughter has been defending me and getting in trouble for doing so.",

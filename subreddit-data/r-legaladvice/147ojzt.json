    "postText": "My ex-husband and I bought a small farm in 2018 while we were together. His mom had excellent credit so it's the two of them on the mortgage. The home was purchased before we were married.\n\nWe are getting divorced and selling the home. He's stated that he has every intention of giving me half the sale money but I don't trust him and I'm so scared I'll end up homeless.\n\nHe's stated that he'll sign a post nup or include this stipulation in the divorce. But is it better to sell while we're still legally married so that he has to give me half? Or make a divorce agreement with an attorney that stipulates this? Which holds more legal sway?",

It was never offered to have my name on the deed, so I didn't know.\n\nIs it legally more powerful to sell the house while still legally married, so that he has to give me half? Or is it better to divorce and have it stipulated? That's where I'm stuck",

            "comment": "It all depends on the how the ownership is structured. Is the property in a trust? If not, and his name is on the deed, and you've resided in the house throughout your marriage, the house is almost certainly marital property. Regardless, no one should get divorced without a lawyer. The house doesn't need to be sold before the divorce, but he will have to buy you out of your equity and this will be part of the divorce agreement. You will not get half the sale price under any circumstance unless the house is totally paid off. You will be entitled to half the equity.",

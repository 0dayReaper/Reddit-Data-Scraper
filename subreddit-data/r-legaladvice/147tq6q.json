I want to know if anyone had a similar problem and how did the overcome it?",

I'll defer to the lawyers here but to me that seems like an offer and an acceptance, especially if you've been there going on 3 months now",

Does it specify that the unit is a 2 bed/2 bath unit, with an entitlement to a washer and dryer?\n\nYou say \"placed\" -- is this some kind of university-related housing?  Were you *guaranteed* a specific floorplan, or (like with many university accommodations), was a 2 bed/2 bath a *preference*?",

In the lease it\u2019s not specified but I recorded the prices and floor plans from the website to show a correlation to what I\u2019m paying for and 2/2 but not sure if that will stick up in court. I called the leasing office to make sure the apartment was a available and to find the room number (because it was needed for the application) and had the associate walk it through with me but this can be proved. I was told every apartment had a washer and dryer but this also can\u2019t be proved and would just be hearsay. Also not university housing just didn\u2019t want to be homeless so took what was available. Which was a gutted out apartment",

Landlords can rent different units for different prices, or even the same unit for different prices, or a smaller unit for the price of a larger one, etc.\n\nYou walked through and saw the apartment (and presumably noticed it was not a 2 bed/2 bath) *before* signing the lease for the unit?",

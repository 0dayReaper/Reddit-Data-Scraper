    "postText": "One of their insured parties rear ended me and assumed fault. Loya was extremely difficult to work with so I got the damages paid for by my insurance company.  Loya is sandbagging on reimbursing me for rental car, diminished value, and loss of use.\n\nCan I take them and their insured party to small claims court in my jurisdiction even if Loya is a national firm?",

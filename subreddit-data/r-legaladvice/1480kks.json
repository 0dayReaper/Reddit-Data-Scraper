None of those people are obligated to consider agreeing to such a thing.\n\nWhich is really all to say that your relationship status has zero to do with and affects nothing about your lease. Just because you are no longer dating means zilch. You\u2019re on a lease together, you both have equal entitlement and responsibility under the lease, and a change in relationship status doesn\u2019t mean a change in lease obligations or entitlements.",

So a straightforward answer to your question is that you ask BF and landlord to agree to modify the lease so that it only has you as a tenant.\n\nOther commenters have addressed the question whether you can make him leave if he doesn't leave voluntarily.",

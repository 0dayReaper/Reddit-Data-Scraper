    "postText": "What can i do to hold a small business accountable? \nA company that hosted my machines breached the contract after 4 months and returned my machines broken. There was a 3 months security deposit and they said will returned afterward. Today when I contacted them and they said the corporation has been dissolved and there are no officers or board of members in the company. They said to sue them if i want but there will be no refund on monthly service payments nor security deposit refund. They will not answer phone calls or emails. What can i do to get that deposit back or hold them account ? Or press charge on the owner or company officers ? Because they flatly said to kiss their ass. And they just robbed me 1800$ on that deposit. Any advices are greatly appreciated.",

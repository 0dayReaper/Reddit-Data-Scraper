    "postText": "I live in Oklahoma and I recently bought a used RV from a dealership that stated it had been cleaned and inspected, but turned out to be filthy and infested with bedbugs. I didn't mind having to clean it, but I don't have the money to deal with bedbugs - not to mention I parked it near my house. I contacted the dealership and they essentially justsaid to keep them updated. I've spent over $500 so far trying to get rid of them. Today I took it back to them and brought up the issue again. They blamed me for the infestation and told me I bought it as is and that it was inspected beforehand before telling me to leave. I've had it for less than a week. Is there anything I can do? They won't let me return it and they refuse to pay to fix it.",

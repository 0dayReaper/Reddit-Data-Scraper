    "postText": "Hi there! We have had some pretty annoying and frustrating housing situations over the past few months. We moved into a new apartment halfway thru May 2023. The dishwasher was not working upon move in, we promptly told maintenance and they were there the next day to look at and advise we need an entirely new dishwasher. It\u2019s now been 29 days without this appliance. \n\nLast week, we had bad storms 2-3 days in a row. We lost power multiple times over those few days. An entire walls worth of outlets stopped working. I was able to hit the reset button on one of them, and it now works. However, our dryer\u2019s outlet is not accessible to us. I spoke with the office last week about the dryer and the outlets. They had me try flipping things in the breaker box, with no luck. They said maintenance would be here last week, but they never came. They said maintenance would be here yesterday but they never came. \n\nI read my lease and it states they have a responsibility to \u201cmake all reasonable repairs\u201d and also \u201cmaintain fixtures\u201d. Do these appliances fit that? And what reasonable time frame do they have? \n\nAll of the marketing and advertising we received also states these appliances are included in all units. - unsure if that matters. \n\nAny input is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

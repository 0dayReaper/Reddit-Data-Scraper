    "postText": "Preface: I understand what I did was wrong, I should have just been a man and walked away. My now ex and I have had a history of anger and irreconcilable differences and I let it get to a point where I completely lost my cool. The relationship needed to end a long time ago. Even with all that being said it would take me too long to explain the dynamics of our former relationship.\n\n\n\nContext: On April 20th I was on the way home after running errands and dropping some stuff off at my now ex\u2019s house per her request after she left for work. My route home from her house makes me pass by her job since I HAVE to take that road to get home. I had a lapse in judgement because we had been arguing really bad before she left and I stopped there, went inside, and made a confrontation. It\u2019s all stemming from this incident. I walked up to her in front of customers and told her \u201cdon\u2019t ever ask me for a fucking thing ever again\u201d yelled that 1 \u201cfuck you\u201d but I began waking away instantly and my back was turned to her, she was following me and tried to get really close behind me but before she could close the gap I, without turning around and keeping my back towards her, knocked a metal chair over that I was passing by between us to create an obstacle between us. I continued walking towards the exit and a man sitting at the highbar tried to grab me when I already passed him, had my back turned to him, and was already halfway out the door so he couldn\u2019t get a good hold of me and I basically just pulled my shoulder away and broke his grasp. I turned around and at this point both the man, my ex, and I were all outside and I said a couple more sentences with expletives in there like \u201cfuck you\u201d and then I got in my car that was parked only a few feet away and drove off. As far as communications go I haven\u2019t spoken to her or anyone from her entourage since that day April 20th. The very last text I sent her was on that day, saying I\u2019m blocking her number and to go fuck herself and have a nice life, but I didn\u2019t make any threats to shoot anyone or produce a gun at all.\n\n\n\n\nSo 5 days later after the incident I find out from talking to court clerk\u2019s I was issued a court summons for civil court for a PFA against me but it was returned to court. No warrants or writs of arrest to the day of me writing this post have been issued for me. Some weeks later I got a letter in the mail about a new court date since I apparently missed the first one since I was never officially served. Then about a week after that I got a knock on my apartment door from a sheriff and it was in the morning. I stayed completely quiet, I didn\u2019t move at all he knocked again waited then got in his car and left. He dropped the summons off at the foot of my door. He apparently was ordered to serve the original court summons for the original court date which had already passed, and after reading it I see where I\u2019m ordered to pay all court fees and surrender my firearms. I would like to contest or petition this if at all possible. What happens if I sell my guns before the court date? I mean if I can\u2019t use them for the duration of the PFA why can\u2019t I sell them to either someone with an FFL or a third party who passes background checks? What can I expect as again this is civil court not criminal. Again, no warrants or writs of arrest to this day of me writing this post have been issued for me, just a new court date in 3 days. I never got any phone calls just the first summons that was originally returned to court, the 1 letter for the new court date, and that 1 summons that the sheriff left at my door for the original court date which I\u2019m not sure is the summons that was returned to court. I was also told my ex isn\u2019t seeking any damages, only stipulations were surrender firearms and pay court fees.",

    "postText": "For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.\n\nAt first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.\n\nI've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. \n\nShe will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs \"free\" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then \"free\" them. \n\nNumerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.\n\nWhen she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.\n\nNow I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).\n\nI just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.\n\nI've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.\n\nI feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.",

            "comment": "As someone who had exactly this happen I can tell you that the first time something serious happens to her, you are going to liable and they are going to come after you. For 2 years I dealt with my neighbors kid coming over, opening my gate, and doing whatever she pleased. Let my last dog out to the point I had to keep him inside and learn crate training. When I put a lock on the gate she would climb the fence and fall over the side, this is where she got hurt one time and the parents tried to sue me for her broken arm and the piece of lattice that stabbed through the her arm. \n\nI had multiple calls to police, videos, and a declaration that stated the family was not allowed on my property (restraining order) and I had my insurance involved with the whole thing in case something did happen. They didn't have a case in the long run and although they tried to plaster me as a asshole neighbor with no compassion for their autistic kid, once it happened again where another neighbors dog ended being killed from running into the street, the whole neighborhood got the same thing I have.\n\nGet a restraining order, get a property attorney involved and call the cops. Her parents obviously don't give a shit about your property. So get your ducks in a row and get records going. Any and all videos are helpful. \n\nWithout all that I would have owed to this day probably. Not worth it.",

I think the issue is that the phrasing is usually used in the context of 'this is something I could choose to do' -- I've never before heard of it used in the negative.  \"Not calling the cops isn't on the table\" vs \"Calling the cops isn't on the table\".  The double negative on the first is odd, but the latter sounds like calling the cops simply isn't something that can or will be done.  ",

Explain to them what is happening and that you will be calling the cops every time, and then do it.  \n\nYou have the right to privacy in your own home/property, and you have the right to not have to child proof your property because a child lives next door who is not supervised properly.  It sounds like these parents are super entitled and used to everyone bending over backwards, doing nothing, giving them their way, tolerating bad behavior, and letting the girl run amok because of her disabilities.  \n\nI wonder if you could put a panel at the top of the fence just on that side that would at 2ft to the fence?  If she uses a ladder to get up, how is she getting down the fence on your side?",

Trust me, this warrants an assessment from someone from the agency to determine if the family needs to be investigated or provided services. Just because they come do an assessment, doesn't necessarily mean they are starting a case, nor taking the child, so don't feel bad. We have cases called Family Evaluations, where we do not open a traditional case, rather we assist the families in getting appropriate community services and resources to help solve issues like this. I would tell the hotline operator who you are, your address, what has occured, how many times, and mention having videos of it happening. The assessment worker should come speak with you. Again, this doesn't make you a bad person for reporting, just a responsible individual. Her being unsupervised to the point where she can access dangerous environments like this, is a hazardous situation. If she were to drown, the parents would be put in jail for neglect leading to a fatality. If this is all due to her parent's inattentiveness, then they need to have a cased open to make them understand the gravity of the situation, or if she is just too much for them to handle, then they to be connected with the appropriate services.",

Ensure time stamps are on all videos and makes copies of everything you note down. If police come speak with you, get their card with either the call screen number again or case number, also inquire about trespassing procedures for the whole family.

They should be able to lock up the ladder and the problem would be solved. You've done everything you can to secure your property.\n\nIf calling the cops doesnt do the trick call cps and report the parents each time she comes over as well. It seems like you will need to be very persistent to resolve this situation. You could also look into getting a restraining order against the girl. ",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.6319918 &amp; 17/64ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "I wish this was fake but it's not. The first thing you see when you type in my full name on google is \"Original Poster's Butthole.\" This page was created in 2012. I was only 15 at the time. I have reported it a million times, even asked friends to report it. It's humiliating. I tried requesting the name change of the page. Reported it for every option possible. Facebook says it doesn't violate terms. Tried claiming it as my business since at the bottom of the page it claims to be automatically generated off interest of the topic and not affiliated with the business which I don't understand how that happened, and it wouldn't let me claim it. It was never a business. I was a child. I feel so hopeless. Any advice would be appreciated. I promise I'm not trolling and have proof if needed with my name obviously edited out. LOCATION: CALIFORNIA. \nTLDR/ Facebook automatically generated a page when I was 15 saying my butthole is a business location with a pin close to the home I used to live in and nothing I can do can get it removed.",

Unfortunately, Facebook doesn't seem to have a working support phone number or email address, and the best I could find was their \"help community\".\n\nHere's how you get to it on the mobile app: facebook home &gt; icon with the three lines near the top right of the screen &gt; help &amp; support &gt; help community\n\nYou can post there and *maybe* get a human being responding to your post. Failing that, it may be worth talking to a lawyer. Exact details depend on what the page contains, but the name alone should've been enough to get it removed. The fact that it's stayed for 8 years is ridiculous and bizarre.",

The first thing you see when you type in my full name on google is \"Original Poster's Butthole.\" This page was created in 2012. I was only 15 at the time. I have reported it a million times, even asked friends to report it. It's humiliating. I tried requesting the name change of the page. Reported it for every option possible. Facebook says it doesn't violate terms. Tried claiming it as my business since at the bottom of the page it claims to be automatically generated off interest of the topic and not affiliated with the business which I don't understand how that happened, and it wouldn't let me claim it. It was never a business. I was a child. I feel so hopeless. Any advice would be appreciated. I promise I'm not trolling and have proof if needed with my name obviously edited out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.973 29/273rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "This is my first time posting to reddit besides one other post in a diff subreddit. My (ex)fiance and I just renewed a year long lease in may. It's a one bedroom. On June first, he sat me down and told me he didn't love me anymore, and that while he couldn't tell me when this started, it had been months. (We got engaged in January.) He implied that he had hoped we'd be able to stay roommates until the lease let up but that's obviously not happening, I don't feel comfortable doing that.\n\nPer our lease, we're liable for a $196 reletting charge for moving out early if:\n1. Fail to give written notice (it's a month I believe)\n2. Move out without paying rent in full for the entire lease term (close to 8k)\n\nThis fee is also not a lease cancellation fee or buyout fee. It's saying a buyout is possible but I'd basically have to beg the landlord to approve it. It also says that if we replace a resident (me) is allowed if they accept it (in writing). If that's the case no money is due. \n\nMy worry is, if he doesn't find a roommate, am I also obligated to pay that money? Can he or his family take me to court? I'm not breaking the lease because I want to, I can't afford to stay where we live, so I have to move back in with my dad. Any advice is good advice, this was my first apartment so lease agreements and landlords scare me. Please help.",

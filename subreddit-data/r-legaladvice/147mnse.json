    "postText": "Our Auntie left me and siblings her house in her will, but she also made a provision that her partner has right to reside for the rest of his life. I am unclear on our legal responsibilities and insurance. To be clear, we are very happy with the situation and are not trying to force someone we see as our uncle out or anything. However he is not a very responsible person, and I doubt he has any insurance and the house isn't in a great state.\n\nWhat are our legal responsibilities. For example of there was a fire and neighbouring properties were damaged, would be liable. Of the house develops structural problems then are we liable to make safe etc?\n\nIf we need to buy insurance then what do we need?",

You would be well served to get a consultation with a local attorney to answer these questions and come up with a plan to make sure you are protected.\n\nYou may also want to consider buying an \"umbrella liability\" insurance policy, which is surprisingly inexpensive.",

But in most states the life tenant is responsible for taxes, insurance, maintenance and upkeep. Often it creates conflict over time as the life tenant has all the responsibilities of ownership but no equity to use to pay for them. Remaindermen have no responsibility and little incentive to invest in maintaining the property because they have no right to even set foot on it while life tenant is alive.",

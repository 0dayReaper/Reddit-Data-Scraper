    "postText": "I have a signed agreement that the seller of my recently purchased home would provide cash credit for a radon remediation system, to be held by the closing attorney in an escrow account to pay the invoice after the work is completed. Come to find out, the closing attorney failed to collect this from the seller at closing, and now does not have it in escrow account to pay the invoice. The attorney is now going back to the seller, weeks after closing, requesting them to pay for this after the fact. If the seller refuses to pay now, what are my options? Shouldn't the attorney be making this right, since they are the ones who dropped the ball?  There are emails between my buyer's agent and the attorney in which they state that they will hold the money for this.",

If this comes to a fight one guesses the closing company will handle it.  If not I\u2019d consult a counsel - but that\u2019s almost unimaginable here.",

Apparently the attorney plans to play it off to the sellers like now (2.5 weeks after closing, without any mention ever of this being the case) is when this credit payment is supposed to be due, in an effort to cover up their mistake. Shady af, making people believe they just didn't understand the process, rather than admit their error. Also seems like if sellers ask literally anyone, they will quickly learn this isn't how these transactions are supposed to go.",

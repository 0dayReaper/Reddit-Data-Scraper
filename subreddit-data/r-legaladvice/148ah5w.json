    "postText": "Hello, so the other day I was involved in an accident. I was leaving my parallel parking spot when I was hit. The scene is this: \n\nI\u2019m parallel parked on the right of a one way road which has 2 lanes. The light is red so traffic is not moving and I see there\u2019s enough space for me to start getting out of my parking spot so I pull the nose of my vehicle into the left lane adjacent to where I\u2019m parked. I\u2019m not fully out because there is a car in front of me in said adjacent lane and we\u2019re all waiting for the light to turn green, In the meantime cars start filling up the 2 lanes. One car in particular gets very close to me and I notice this. Once the light turns green before I even start to move, he squeezes in between the nose of my car and the cars on the furthest left lane. While doing this, the passenger corner of his front bumper hits the corner of my driver side fender and front bumper basically pulling/dragging my bumper half way off and damaging the corner of my fender. He had minimal damage, some scuffs and scratches on his passenger fender, but I ended up with a half broken bumper and fender. Who would be at fault here? \n\nThanks in advance.",

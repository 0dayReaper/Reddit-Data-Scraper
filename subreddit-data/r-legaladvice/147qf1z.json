    "postText": "I would like to make my own \u201ccompany\u201d better phrased studio of sorts that outputs art.\n\nThe name I\u2019ve thought of for a long time seems to be well known by a dark-humor game and doubles as said games\u2019 creators\u2019 name. I can only wonder if the name I chose is something common.\n\nMy worries and questions:\n- How do I register or make this studio more, real or tangible\u2026 should I register something like an LLC?\n- Would the name be copyright eligible? Would that mean anything like lawsuits, and how could I search for anything known by this name to know what names to stay clear of?\n\nI know this is a silly question\u2026 I\u2019ve really only recently decided to actually go after this dream or idea of sorts I\u2019ve had going for a few years. Thanks for reading and offering any help/advice.",

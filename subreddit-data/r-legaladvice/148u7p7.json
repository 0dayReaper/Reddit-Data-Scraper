    "postText": "Hey all I have a question. The building sent a threatening email saying they are doing dome auditing and they are threatening to turn electricity off for me in the building unless I put the utilities in my name.  The thing is the utilities have been under my name since I moved in.  Prior to this the building was being managed in a somewhat sketchy manner. Nothing overtly but just some odd things (tenants sending rent to different management, even though it was all the same management) . I was worried but I talked to my neighbors and they all received an email saying that their electricity would be turned off unless they put the utilities in the each of their names.  I am not sure why but it seems sketchy that they would send the same email to everyone, and then ask for personal account utility information.  Am I required to give them my utility account info by law? Another interesting tidbit is the old management company did not provide copies of our leases to the new one. Anyway I would rather not give them my utility bill if it\u2019s not required by lease or law.  Am I required?",

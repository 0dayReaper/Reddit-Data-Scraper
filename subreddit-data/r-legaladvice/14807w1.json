    "postText": "March 2022 I had undeniably botched surgery. Couple months ago I made an appointment and brought a friend for back up but I really had no idea what outcome to expect, certainly not a full refund. \n\nWithin 2 minutes of me mostly staring at him, trying to not be the first one to \"name a price\", he completely crumpled and offered a full 12k refund. It took a couple of reminder phone calls but they mailed the physical paperwork that I have to sign and have notarized that just says that I accept the refund and will not come after them for more. No language amounting to an NDA. \n\nThis surgeon has been practicing for 40 yrs in a very large west coast city. I can't imagine someone staying in business handing out refunds like that so, is it possible that a refund is cheaper than me/lawyer digging and finding there's possibility for more? \n\nI saved for 5 yrs for this and it would be helpful to recoup the 1.3k anesthesia, the unpaid weeks I took off and pay for the time off/anesthesia again when I fix this.\n\n\n\nETA: OK, I just wanted some validation I guess I wasn't going to he laughed 100% out of a lawyers office. Thank you!\n\n\n\nETA 2: I haven't signed the paperwork, I've actually been sitting on it for a couple of months because I just didn't have a good feeling about it but I've never sought formal restitution before and the whole thing makes me nervous. To be honest, I gave it 6 months to heal and be sure, and it took me another six months (even walkimg around like this!) to work myself up to go back to his office to say he f'd up. \n\n\n\n\n(I had a rhinoplasty that had all the pain but zero actual difference and another surgeon said that the scar tissue now makes it impossible to operate on for 3-5 yrs, as well as a chin implant that is soooo off center my smile is undeniably crooked and I have different definitions on each jawline. It's bad.)",

            "comment": "NAL, and you should consult one to represent you in arbitration/mediation, because that\u2019s where you\u2019re likely to see relief.   I have some experience in medmal. \n\nIt is *extremely* difficult to find malpractice counsel where you weren\u2019t seriously maimed or your heirs are looking for wrongful death.   The cost of litigating these cases is astronomical and your counsel is only going to front that in expectation of a high 6 digit award or better.   \n\nFurther, while it\u2019s easy to find another surgeon who will tell *you* it\u2019s a botched job, and that fixing it is years in the future, it is a whole \u2018nother thing to find one that will do so in court.    Plaintiff expert witnesses are pariahs in their local area and have to make a substantial portion of their income as expert witnesses as a result.  \n\nAll of this is to say that finding counsel is going to take a lot of consultations.  Have a copy of your visit notes, before and after photos, etc.   \n\nAn actual lawyer will break this down into the costs to fix the present state and then financial compensation for how you got here.   These are known as special damages and non-economic damages.  Assuming a successful legal outcome for you, the fee calculation will include the special damages, but those are costs you\u2019ve either incurred or will incur, so the value of your non-economic damages (pain and suffering, disfigurement, lost earning capacity) needs to be more than a third of your total damages just to break even here.    There is very little chance, if you still have something recognizable as a nose, that you have a claim for punitive damages.  \n\nSo let\u2019s say the cost to fix all of this, all in, is $25,000 (it\u2019s going to be more expensive to redo than do in the first place, and you\u2019ll be paying in five years where prices will almost assuredly go up between now and then) and you lost four weeks of work to recovery to no good end and you\u2019ll need to do another four in the replacement surgery.  If you make $1,000 week, that\u2019s $8000, so your specials are $33,000.   Compared to the $12k you were offered, counsel can definitely improve your special damages.    Add in the cost of the botched procedure and the anesthesiology bill, you\u2019re pushing $56k.  \n\nThe challenge is going to be the non-economic damages.  Persistent facial disfigurement *generally* pays out in the range of $40-150k in non-economics.  We could take $100k as a benchmark - asymmetry and the fact that there\u2019s a substantial delay before you could have a revision rhinoplasty will come in to play here.  The maximum allowable fee percentage varies by area, but with expert witness costs off the top and a normal fee award you\u2019d probably be looking at a $50k or so net payout in non-economic damages if the current state is visibly \u201coff\u201d to a normal person looking at a before and after picture of you. \n\nThis is just not a lot of money for contingent-fee personal injury attorneys, sadly.    You\u2019re likely to be assigned a new associate in a smaller firm.   Which is fine - you aren\u2019t sitting on a case that necessarily needs to go to trial.  You just need someone to represent you in arbitration / mediation and get you a reasonable settlement. \n\nSo meet with a few attorneys before you sign *anything* (with the attorneys or for the surgeon).  Get a sense i your local area of what something like this could be worth.  Do not necessarily pick the attorney who values it the highest.  Pick someone you find easy to work with and who can immediately refer you for a consultation by a qualified surgeon who does plaintiff expert witness work.",

You have a recognition by the original surgeon and a competent peer that this is not a good outcome, and more importantly, it may be outside the bounds of \u201cexpected\u201d bad outcomes.  Not liking the outcome is one thing, and even highly competent surgeons can create an aesthetic result that doesn\u2019t meet patient expectations.  The difference here may be that you had worsened asymmetry, that the technique used was inappropriate for your anatomy, etc. \n\nThis is the internet and I don\u2019t know you, so I feel free to say what follows despite it being blunt to the point of rudeness. \n\nI think you should pursue this further than talking to about three medmal attorneys *if and only if* the damage is patently obvious to people who are willing to be brutally honest with you.   The kind of friends and family who you have a genuine long term bond with who, when you say \u201cTell me the absolute truth.  It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t tell me I look fine when I don\u2019t.  It\u2019s also important that you\u2019re not just agreeing with me because I see a problem and you want to be supportive. Don\u2019t worry about hurting my feelings.  Do I look noticeably worse than before?\u201d\n\nWe are our own worst critics.   We see defects where other people don\u2019t.  I\u2019ve had two midface reconstructive procedures, both done by top surgeons in the field, and if I\u2019m in harsh light and feeling self-critical, I can find the flaws in the work of both.     The face I see in the mirror is not the face I grew up with or grew into, and my mind is capable of picking up even the smallest of differences between what I think I look like and what I actually look like.  \n\nBut, when I asked my close friends to be frank and brutal about what they see (and trust me, my friends routinely roast me over fashion choices, my hair and my personality), they always pointed to the positive improvements in my appearance from the work I had done.  Without knowing the details of the procedures they point out specific improvements.  What they see is the intended outcome of the work - I no longer look stoned all the time, I don\u2019t scowl as much, my forehead isn\u2019t a relief map.   \n\nAll of this is a long way of saying \u201cmake sure that the juice is worth the squeeze\u201d - if the rhinoplasty impaired your breathing, if it makes people go \u201cgirl, you look like you kissed a hedge trimmer\u201d, if your glasses sit funny, if a couple of consults for revision think there\u2019s fixable defects rather than \u201cthis isn\u2019t the nose I picked from the catalog\u201d, pursue this.  If it\u2019s something that brutally honest friends say they don\u2019t see, consider signing the refund paperwork and chalking the rest up to \u201cthis didn\u2019t go as planned but it wasn\u2019t negligent either\u201d.",

Since this was an elective procedure your health insurance likely won't cover any medical expenses associated with complications from this.  It could be very expensive for you.  You need to consult a malpractice lawyer.  In addition to the refund of cost of services there needs to be either a massive sum to accommodate for future medical losses or a caveat that they will be covered.    \n\n\nYou also need to consider who will fix this. As a blanket rule a lot of surgeons won't touch another surgeons work. He botched your surgery, why would another surgeon want to skew his track record on someone else's mistake?  You need to think of it that way.  Getting revision surgery is very complicated.  You are almost certainly going to have to travel for it and see a top tier surgeon.  If they will even take you.",

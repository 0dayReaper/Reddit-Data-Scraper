    "postText": "Apologies in advance and for posting in here, LegalAdviceUK is down due to the API protest and really could do with some advice.\n\nI\u2019m in England\n\nGot plasterers doing some work in my back garden today. 2 guys turned up this morning at the agreed time and they started work as scheduled. For context, the owner of the plastering company had done work for me a couple of years ago so I know him from before. Everything was going fine with the owner knocking at the door when he needed something (needed to go to the toilet).\n\nI have a rescue dog who is quite reactive and doesn\u2019t like guests and i will put him in my bedroom if they need to come inside to talk/use the bathroom.\n\nAfter the tradesman used the toilet, i let my dog back downstairs as it is really hot today. I work from home and my office is upstairs.\n\nBoth front and back doors are shut (but not locked).\n\nAbout 20 mins ago, i heard a man screaming and my dog barking and growling. I immediately ran downstairs to see my back door open and a third tradesman who was being attacked by my dog. I managed to pull him away quickly and i think he just bit his leg (he was wearing jeans). I didn\u2019t see any blood but not sure if it was serious or not.\n\nBefore i knew he was a tradesman i immediately asked who he was. His answer was that he was here to do plastering and was looking for the other 2 (they were in the garden in the outhouse doing work) and he was looking for them.\n\nTldr:\nGot 2 plasterers in the garden today working on my outhouse, 2 of which i knew were coming, no mention of a third. Owner aware i have a dog and knew to knock on my door if he needed anything. My dog was inside with both doors closed. Someone had walked down my side passage to the garden (this was 2pm, the first 2 guys had arrived at 9am this morning) and decided to open my back door (who i did not know was arriving) when my dog  attacked him.\n\nEdit: Typo",

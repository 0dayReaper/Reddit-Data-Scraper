    "postText": "\rHello everyone, I hope you're doing well. Earlier today, I received a letter from the DMV. It appears to be an Attorney's Information Request related to a minor incident that occurred in a parking lot last year, where no one was injured. They have requested my driver's license on their behalf. Surprisingly, the case has already been closed, but I'm unsure why I received this mail just now. What would be the appropriate course of action for me at this point? Should I reach out to my insurance company to discuss the matter?",

What kind of information is being requested? You said the first case was closed but that\u2019s very vague.",

Your insurance companies case? \n\nMaybe your insurance company determined your policy didn\u2019t cover the incident so they closed the case on their part and now the other party is now coming after you directly to recoup damages.",

She's the one who has been paying on it--if she's not paying in it then it's not even an active policy but regardless....You're not entitled to the money. Unless the courts stripped her of her parental rights, she still has an insurable interest here and this isn't fraud.",

            "comment": "&gt; And it's I think it's BS that if I die she gets money for doing nothing.\n\nShe gets money if you die because she is paying the premiums on that policy. That's not nothing - that's her choice to manage the risks as she sees them. The best way to address this is by living a long and happy life, such that the policy expires (or such that the premiums start to outweigh the benefit).\n\nYour mother had an insurable interest in you when she opened the policy, and the policy itself is nothing more than a contract between your mother and the insurer. If your mother is in breach, the insurer can void the policy, but if she's not, then the insurer is bound to fulfil it.\n\nYou have no right to assume your mother's contracts in general, and insurance contracts are not special in this context. If you need insurance on yourself, get a good insurance broker to help you find a policy suitable for your needs.",

And it's I think it's BS that if I die she gets money for doing nothing.\n\nLife insurance isn't a reward for doing something.  \n\nThe policy is an agreement between your mother and then insurance company. She was your legal parent when she purchased the policy and, presumably, she's paying the premiums. \n\n\n&gt;She still has the life insurance but is that legal if she gave up her rights? \n\n\nYes\n\n&gt;Is it fraud?\n\nNo\n\n&gt; Can I do anything about it or get the rights to the policy?\n\nNo\n\n&gt; Because I promise you she won't give it to me.\n\nWhy would she?  You could get your own whole life policy if you want one.",

    "postText": "I told the nurse that I had pain radiating down my arm.  She put in an order and it took 8 days for them to give me the x-ray.  They kept telling me it was in queue.   When I was about to leave, they said they were going to give me a full set of xrays.  They found out that my dislocated broken shoulder popped out and I had to go for emergency surgery.  The problem is, if they had given me the xray that day, I would have avoided this extreme pain.  What can I do about this?",

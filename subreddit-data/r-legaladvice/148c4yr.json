    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI sent off a small claims form a week ago today to the money claims address in Salford. I filled out paper form N1, sent off three copies and enclosed a cheque for the amount due. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t heard anything at all and my cheque hasn\u2019t been cashed. I was wondering:\n\n1. If this is unusual?\n2. How I can possibly chase this up - I can\u2019t find anyone to call or contact online?\n3. What I actually am supposed to be waiting for - is it the letter that confirms the date the defendant will have to respond by? I\u2019m not expecting her to respond so just not really sure what to do\u2026",

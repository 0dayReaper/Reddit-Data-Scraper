    "postText": "Hello all! In January 2021 I injured my back at work. It didn\u2019t hurt immediately so I thought nothing of it and didn\u2019t even consider to report it, until the next morning when I woke up and could barely move. I went into work I believe the next day (possibly the day after) and complained about my back hurting. My boss, the GM, said that because I didn\u2019t report the injury within 24 hours, there was nothing he could do. Obviously I explained why I didn\u2019t report it, and he still dismissed me. After talking with my family, we decided it was BS and I ended up threatening to get an attorney. Of course, once I mentioned \u201cattorney\u201d my boss immediately caved and got me into contact with Sedgwick. \n\nMy experience with Sedgwick was horrendous. They were so unhelpful I can\u2019t even describe it without taking up a whole page. Their first course of action was for me to talk with a tele-health \u201cdoctor\u201d, who told me \u201cour main priority is to get you back to work.\u201d MY priority was to not be crippled at 18 years old over a freaking work injury. They told me to go back to work under useless restrictions. I didn\u2019t go because I physically couldn\u2019t. A week went by and when I had my follow-up appointment the \u201cdoctor\u201d asked how work was going, to which I told her I hadn\u2019t gone. When she very rudely asked why, I explained to her that I couldn\u2019t even stand to shower, let alone work for 9 hours. I demanded to be seen by a real, in-person doctor. They reluctantly obliged and I was sent to a Carenow. They were as helpful as they could be, and they prescribed a muscle relaxer that I couldn\u2019t drive or work on. Keep in mind, this whole time I am NOT getting paid, and I don\u2019t remember the reasoning behind it. \n\nAnother week passes and things aren\u2019t getting better, so Sedgwick refers me to a physical therapist. One session a week for six weeks. The therapists were amazing and so kind, but it just wasn\u2019t helping. I ended up going back to work during this time because I couldn\u2019t afford not to. After the six weeks was up, there was nothing else Sedgwick would do for me.\n\nSo, for almost two months I dealt with that just for nothing to be fixed. Whatever happened to my back ended up getting slightly better on its own, but since then I\u2019ve dealt with chronic pain.\n\nFast forward to last Wednesday (6/7). It\u2019s raining, I\u2019m walking from the parking lot to my job (a new one, thank god) and I slip and fall. I think nothing of it, walk it off, and get on with my day. The next day, I notice the pain in my back is substantially worse than normal. Day by day it just gets worse. I ended up taking off of work for the pain and went to a Carenow on Saturday. The doctor felt my back and just let out a groan, saying that the compression goes up into my neck and down my arm. He suggests I seek out an osteopathic doctor. I was again prescribed a muscle relaxer and a strong NSAID, neither of which have helped but I\u2019m hoping maybe it just hasn\u2019t been long enough. \n\nI\u2019m already $200 in the hole for a 2-year-old work injury and I suspect that the bills will keep racking up considering the fact that I am now, again, unable to work. I can\u2019t keep living with this pain. I\u2019m only 21, yet I\u2019m bedridden because my shitty, old boss and an unhelpful Sedgwick rep didn\u2019t take me seriously. I\u2019m not usually one for revenge, but I can\u2019t help but think that this situation I\u2019m in is their fault (at least to an extent) and I\u2019m wondering if I can get some sort of compensation even though it\u2019s been so long. Obviously if I thought it would be this big of a deal I wouldn\u2019t have waited to advocate more for myself, but here we are. I\u2019m genuinely afraid that this will burden me for the rest of my life.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much if you\u2019ve made it this far in the post. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I can\u2019t afford to get this treated on my own. Is there any way I would be able to get any kind of compensation either from my old employer or Sedgwick, or am I SOL?\n\nThanks again in advance, I hope everyone is well.",

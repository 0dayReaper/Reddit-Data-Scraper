    "postText": "So I recently got a house with a 1 year lease on it, however things have changed in my life and I need/want to move out of the house towards the end of the year. Should I talk tot my landlord now about what it looks like to break the lease then or wait till closer to the end of the year? There is nothing clearly stated in my lease paper about breaking the lease in it. I\u2019m in the state of PA",

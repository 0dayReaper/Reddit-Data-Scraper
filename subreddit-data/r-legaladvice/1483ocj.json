    "postText": "My ex and I got a dog together when we were in a relationship.  We went and looked for our dog together and chose her together. I paid for her.  When everything was set up for her (vet records, license, daycare), they were set up in his name because at the time we didn\u2019t see the need to put both names down. During our time together we raised and cared for her equally.  All costs were split equally as well.  When we broke up we decided to split custody of our dog doing a week on and then a week off.  This arrangement has been going on for over a year now.  Recently my ex decided that he wanted our dog full time saying that he would no longer drop her off for me to have my week.  He is saying that our dog was a birthday present but I don\u2019t remember that being the case.  He said that I wrote it in his birthday card but said he threw it out so there is no proof.  I would prefer for our arrangement to stay the same with split custody but I also don\u2019t want to lose her. Is it a waste of time to pursue this legally or do I have a chance?",

Now, if his birthday is the day of the purchase, then maybe, but still, this was negated, IMHO not a lawyer, by the post-split agreement to split the time with the dog on a week-by-week basis.",

However, there are some courts, such as in Texas and Alaska, where a visitation schedule has been set up. Wisconsin has also been considering such situations also.\n\nIn this case, I'd also think of it as contract law. This was an unwritten contract, where one person has unilaterally decided to break it. So once again, a court could likely just rule yes, he broke the contract for the $10 dog, and award her $5. The pursuit would be considered by all to be a long-shot, but without attempting it the dog is gone to the ex.",

And it involves arguments and pleadings that can\u2019t be constructed by a non-attorney.  So it is a multi-thousand dollars effort at an extremely long shot at shared custody of a dog.  And the \u201ccontract law\u201d argument doesn\u2019t wash.  At all.",

At all.\n\nLOL, greatly appreciated, as the \"doesn't wash\" reminded me of \"won't fly\" and thus the humorous \"Red Bull gives you wings\" lawsuit.\n\nBut first, contract law 101, yes basic but seems to need clarification,\n\n1. Offer: If you purchase Red Bull, you'll get wings\n2. Acceptance: I will purchase Red Bull, and I will get wings\n3. Performance: The purchaser of Red Bull gets wings\n\nThe acceptance part is straightforward, but the performance part is where some have difficulty. In the mentioned Red Bull case, purchasers did not get wings. This is an actual case, a class action lawsuit, and Red Bull settled the case for $13 million, and a similar case in Canada for $640,000. I think had the case gone to court, Red Bull would have won, but that is just speculation.\n\nThere was a similar lawsuit when Pepsi advertised (the offer) getting a Harrier jet for 7,000,000 points Leonard v. Pepsico. John Leonard noticed that you could purchase points for $0.10, and gave a check for $700,000  to Pepsi (the acceptance). Pepsi refused to deliver the Harrier Jet, (performance) worth $37 million,  so the case went to court. Ultimately that case was decided in favor of Pepsico, as the court stated it was not a legitimate offer as required by the Restatement of Contracts and that no reasonable person, which the court often relies on, would think that you could purchase a $37 million jet for $700K. In addition the judge ruled that this was governed by the Statutes of Frauds, and thus since the contract wasn't in writing it did not exist.  Also, Pepsi updated the price to 700 million points, thus making the purchase price to $70 million, which no person accepted.\n\nSo maybe in the dog situation, an actual lawyer could verify the claim that this is, or is not, a contract law situation, and if the Statues of Frauds would have required a written contract, which I don't think is necessary in this specific situation.\n\n1. Offer: I will have the dog for one week, then we switch, and you have the dog for one week.\n2. Acceptance: I agree to have the dog for one week, and then you have the dog for one week.\n3. Performance: Each week, for over a year, this arrangement has been performed.\n\nAlso, if the dog is worth more than $20, it is possible to demand a jury trial, as the 7th Amendment guarantees this.\n\nOf course, it is rare and extreme in the real world, but there is an actual example where a lady spent $100,000 litigating just such a case. As in the Red Bull case, sometimes merely starting a lawsuit can lead to a settlement.\n\nAnd finally, while it isn't a written legal precedent, the saying \"never say never\" should be heeded if it is a lawsuit litigated in front of a jury.\n\nEdit to add: After researching further, I believe I most likely am mistaken, and it might be a requirement for the contract to be in writing. The Statutes of Fraud requires contracts that are not able to be completed within one year to be in writing. I don't know with the agreement continuing for over a year now that the oral agreement will apply. Of course, this is just further proof that the best practice is to get any contract in writing.\n\nSecond Edit: More research, I might have been wrong thinking I was wrong, I wondered because theoretically it was possible that the dog would die within a year.\n\nI found this example:\n\nRoy is a thirty-five-year old paraplegic. Other than the fact that he cannot walk, Roy is in perfect health. Roy makes an oral contract with Jackie in which Roy will pay Jackie $10,000 per year and Jackie will take care of Roy until he dies. This contract is also enforceable because it is theoretically possible that the contract can be fully performed within a year. If Roy dies within a year of making the contract, Jackie has fulfilled the contract within a year. That being the case, this agreement falls outside the statute and does not have to be written down.",

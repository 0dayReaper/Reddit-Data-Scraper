    "postText": "We were sent the initial mortgage disclosures on 5/11 at 8:26 pm and had several text conversations between us and the lender saying that the rate had been reserved for 24 hours as long as we signed in the 24-hour time window. We signed the disclosures on 5/12 at 7:49 pm. Since we did not get confirmation, we texted the loan agent and he said our disclosures were completed: `i reserved the rate from last night for 24 hours and then rates/pricing worsened today. So as long as you DocuSign in the next 2 hours....we are good.`\n\nOn 6/5, 4 days before closing, we were notified that the interest rate we thought we locked in changed. Our agreed-upon rate changed from 5.625% with $876.16 points to 5.875% with $5,192 points.\n\nYes, we don't have any official documents saying the rate was locked. We are first-time home buyers, and we accidentally trusted the judgment and responses of the lender. We were surprised by the rate change, and desperate to accept anything as we only had a few days to close with no other backup options.\n\nWe have it in writing of the loan agent's mistake, `So on that Friday when you asked if you should wait to lock or lock.... i thought i submitted the lock request. It didn't go through..., and we also have phone recordings of both the loan agent and his boss admitting fault.`\n\nIs there anything we can do legally we can do to remedy the damages we have incurred with the increased mortgage rate?",

OP was under contract to buy the house and could be in breach and forfeit their earnest money. I\u2019m not an expert, and would be curious what has happened here in similar cases. I was merely pointing out that you can\u2019t just dismiss that OP has NO damages. Under your theory damages could be their earnest money deposit.",

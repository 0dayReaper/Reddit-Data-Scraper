    "postText": "I work for a small company, but with I think more than 50 employees.  We were all on a health plan under our company (company A), and recently we changed to a different company (company B).  People are pissed. It's a very small, not well-known company that we change to from a more national company.  My wife is pregnant, and would have had to change OBGYNs due to this company not listing her doctor as a provider under our plan (we have the bottom tier plan).  The provider is listed as in network on company B's website, but due to our lowest tier plan, it isn't accepted at current doctor's office.  From my limited research, companies have to notify employees at a minimum 60 days prior to any changes in health coverage, but does that include changing entire companies, or just plans within a company?",

            "comment": "The Affordable Care Act requires 60 days' notice of material modifications to the health plan.  Material modifications are changes that \"eliminate benefits payable under the plan; reduce benefits payable under the plan, including a reduction that occurs as a result of a change in formulas, methodologies or schedules that serve as the basis for making benefit determinations; increase premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or other amounts to be paid by a participant or beneficiary; reduce the service area covered by a health maintenance organization; establish new conditions or requirements (e.g., preauthorization requirements) to obtaining services or benefits under the plan.\"\n\nI'm genuinely not sure that a change that means that a particular doctor's office is no longer available is a material modification if you can get the same service elsewhere.  And, yes, I know that's not what you want to hear when you've been planning to have your delivery with a particular doctor.\n\nThe agency that oversees the Affordable Care Act is the federal Department of Health and Human Services.",

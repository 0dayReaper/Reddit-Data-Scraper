    "postText": "I find myself in a weird situation. I recently purchased life insurance for myself. Aside from granting access to all of my medical records, during the interview process, I was asked if I had things like high blood pressure, anxiety, depression, etc. I answered \"No\" because I haven't been diagnosed with any of these. However, I suspect that I actually have (and have had) something going on with anxiety for a while.\n\nThis past week, I actually experienced my first set of panic attacks (which, let me tell you, aren't great). Now, I want to seek some medical guidance. I just got approved for my policy, so it's not going to look great if I see someone, tell them that I've been having some anxiety the past couple of years and panic attacks just recently, and then they diagnose me with something.\n\nI honestly don't know if I should've told the insurer during the interview process that I *think* I have this or I *think* I have that. I'm not a professional and nothing is yet diagnosed.\n\nWhat's the right answer? Do I call them and tell them I think I may have something? I want to be open with whatever medical professional I see and the insurance company has access to my records for two years for the contestability period--so if they ever review, it'll look fishy.\n\nAlso, if the answer is to just cancel the policy because I should've mentioned during the interview what I have been feeling (but not diagnosed), then that's ok--I just don't want to get in any trouble.\n\nThanks",

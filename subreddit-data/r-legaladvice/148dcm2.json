    "postText": "United States, GA\n\nSorry this is long winded. Just trying to get the thoughts out quickly while I have a chance. \n\nI've had to buy a used car twice within the past year after a hit and run my wife's car was totalled in. Won't get into the nightmare of the previous vehicle, but I traded that car in for a used minivan back in April. I haven't received the tag, and the dealer claims that the previous owner didn't fill out the title transfer with the correct legal name (they used a \"nickname\"), so the dealer needs to \"get another title made.\" It was a process to get this place to send the pay off for my old loan, and now I have to continue pestering them to get anything done for this problem. \n\nI've contacted the tag office. They said there is nothing they can help me with since the vehicle doesn't belong to me.\n\nI've filed a complaint on BBB, where there are many complaints about very similar situations. \n\nThey will not let me talk to the \"title department,\" which is one employee that was rude during the entire transaction process. They were always away from their desk when I started calling Friday. No one will answer my calls starting yesterday. They have emailed me two temporary tags as a PDF document that I've had to print and tape to the original temp tag, which is now cracking and tearing at the bolts. The only person that will communicate with me is the salesman I worked with over texts to his personal cell phone, who is always trying to convince me he's doing everything he can, while also giving excuses like \"we just got a new phone system.\" \n\nI feel like I've been swindled and that I am paying for a car with an unknown owner. I'm worried some of this is going to come back on me, and I'll end up with no car but a nice 14k loan despite that. I work ceaselessly. I'm burnt out, exhausted, and I don't want to deal with this extra problem that is lessening my valuable productivity. I know these guys are hoping I just get tired and stop calling so they can forget about this.",

            "comment": "If you got the loan from a bank/credit union and not the dealer, speak with that creditor. They will be concerned about the title defect and want it fixed.\n\nI would also call the state DOR and explain. They should have regulations this dealer must follow.\n\nYou have the bill of sale and payment records, so unless the dealer goes bankrupt, you can unwind the sale if the title can\u2019t be resolved. But that might take a trip to small claims court.",

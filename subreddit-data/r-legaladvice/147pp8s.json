    "postText": "I live in Missouri- I plead guilty to DWI and damage to another vehicle. I recently got a letter stating I didn't pay the restitution and they want to revoke my unsupervised probation... now, I have to work in order to pay the remaining balance, but I'm not sure how things work. Should I go to my court date? Will I be able to avoid the jail time that was recommended before I was sentenced to probation?",

    "postText": "I'll make this short. I'm pretty sure I know the answer, but wanted to make sure. The states in question are Georgia and Texas. \n\nAn employee wants to record a conversation with his boss. Both states are one party consent states and federal law is one party consent.\n\nI assume that means it's fine to record it (as long as it doesn't go against company policy) but I just wanted to make sure there's no special federal law about recording calls when the parties are in two separate states. I couldn't find anything about this online, which makes me think no such law exists but I'm not a lawyer.\n\nMany thanks to anyone that reads and responds.",

The immediate boss is misrepresenting the situation with employee to the higher ups, which could lead to their ultimate termination. The recording would be used to show that the boss is intentionally putting the employee in a position where the higher ups would think they need to be fired or laid off.",

At the same time, if they're in a position where they need to use it, it will be because they're already in a position of getting fired so I guess it doesn't matter haha",

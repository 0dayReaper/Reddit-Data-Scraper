    "postText": "Hello!\n\nIf someone could help me out with this- I have been harassed over the last few months by a creditor. I am aware of the debt, willing to make payments and have contacted a credit counselor to assist me. The creditor whose been calling me has been very rude and unprofessional asking me personal questions about the status of my personal challengs, even after I agreed to start making payments. I called and asked to be assigned to another creditor and was met with resistance. That's when I decided to contact a debt counselor so I didn't have to deal with these people bullying me over the phone while I'm at work. Now, I received a court order for the 2000$ and change that I owe, which I never denied or said I wouldn't pay. Is this even legit? I thought I had to be denying the debt and not willing to pay for a court order to go through, does anyone know what the next steps would be?",

    "postText": "Hi my Father recently passed. I have a copy of his Will. My Step-Mother and I are co-executers. I\u2019m pretty sure I was named a beneficiary on some things not stated in the will. She is not saying much. What rights do I have to look into this and how do I go about it? My Father had mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease and was in assisted living for the last year and a half. During that time , my Step Mother was Power of Attorney. Could she have changed the beneficiaries on stuff? Is it possible for me to find out if she did? Like I said , I am co-executor. I appreciate any advice.   ",

Executors handle probate.\n\nWhat state is this in? There's no reason to not hire a probate attorney. You and mom both need to go to court to get approved as co-executors. Why both of you?\n\n&gt; I am co-executor\n\nTechnically not yet, not until a court says you are.\n\nAlso [read this](https://www.wikihow.com/Be-an-Executor) general overview.

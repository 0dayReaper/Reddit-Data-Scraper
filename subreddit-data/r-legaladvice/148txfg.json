    "postText": "A few days ago I (20F) was notified that I am no longer receiving Illinois Medicaid due to the fact that I go the school in Indiana and stay in the dorm of my college. This started because I received an email from the Department of Education about being eligible for SNAP benefits. I had talked it over with my mom and she said that it was a good idea to try to apply for the food stamps since I support myself and am in school full time. I applied for SNAP in the state of Illinois and was denied because I go to school in Indiana, about an hour away from my house in Illinois. A few days later I got a letter in the mail stating that my health insurance was going to be discontinued at the end of this month. I called the Department of Human Services and they told me that I was not going to be able to have health insurance from the state of Illinois because I was now considered an Indiana resident. My driver\u2019s license is my home address in Illinois, it is where I am registered to vote and I go home often to visit my family and on breaks sometimes. I am not sure how to proceed since I do not have a permanent address in Indiana and my dorm is temporary. I do not want to have to move out of my dorm and live at home, commuting over an hour every day to school and work so that I can have health insurance again and be considered an Illinois resident.",

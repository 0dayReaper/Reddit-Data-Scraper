    "postText": "There was an incident on Tuesday last week in which I left work early. I messaged my GM the reasons and let a manager know why I was leaving that day. I wasn\u2019t on the schedule for the next five days until today. I went in at 8am and was then notified that I was being let go. I\u2019m not contesting being fired as I understand. My question is, is it legal for them to withhold notice of termination for five days? I could have started and found another job within those 5 days and it wouldn\u2019t have effected my income much. Now I have a work week that was missed and this week searching for a job because they didn\u2019t notify me of the termination earlier.",

    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nWe moved into an apartment in 2021 and are moving September 1st. When we moved in we paid first/last month's rent along with a security deposit. Unfortunately the original owner was a real crook who did, in fact, go to prison after selling off his properties. I am concerned he never transferred our security deposit to the new building owner, and am unsure how to recuperate these funds. Outside of the initial lease, we were never notified of the status of our security deposit from either building owner.\n\nAppreciate any help!",

                    "comment": "Correct, and to make it clear - follow the normal legal process for move out and return of security deposit. You shouldn't try to get it early because the building was sold, etc. The new owner has become the other party on your lease contract which (likely, hopefully) spells out the security deposit amount. That means they are legally obligated to follow all terms on the lease and relevant law. The fact the building sold and money might not have been transferred is of no legal concern to you.",

It is entirely up to the current owner of the building to return the security deposit.  \n\nThe current and former owners should have transferred those funds to the new owner as part of the sale.  If they didn't, the new owner has to come up with it.",

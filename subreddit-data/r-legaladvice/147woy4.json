    "postText": "State: Florida\n\nI recently contacted a lawyer regarding a land trust and he suggested a Lady Bird Deed would allow this, I am seeking confirmation.\n\nMy mother has a mortgaged property with a balloon payment clause. Essentially my understanding is that if the property is transferred, the full payment is due. We have been looking for ways to avoid a \"transfer\" so we can continue making payments and eventually pay off the property.\n\nNow my research indicates that a LBD will transfer the property to us (my mother's children) immediately upon her death, avoiding probate, and we would be free to continue making payments without interruption.\n\nIs this accurate?",

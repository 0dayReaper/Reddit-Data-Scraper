    "postText": "WI, US\n\nI work for a small business (&lt;50) employees. It is not a food or food service company.\n\nThe owner\u2019s dog has chosen my desk as the place it poops when owner ignores it for too long. It happens about once every two weeks and has been happening since he got the dog about 8 months ago.\n\nThe owner won\u2019t clean it up unless asked, at least partially because he\u2019s not observant and doesn\u2019t notice it. Sometimes, even when asked, he won\u2019t do anything about it for several hours. I\u2019m looking for other jobs but I don\u2019t want to quit without anything lined up.\n\nI have photos and text/email documentation of most of the times this has happened. \n\nThe owner is basically the HR department. Is this a hostile work environment? The company has had issues with code/OSHA in the past.",

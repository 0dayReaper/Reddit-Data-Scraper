    "postText": "I broke a toilet seat under normal use, I guess I twisted weird when I got off the seat and it broke one of the cheap plastic hinges. I hesitated on what to do. I was unsure if I\u2019d be fined for breaking the toilet seat or fined for tampering with their toilet if I fixed it myself. Well I already had an issue to be repaired free of charge so I added the toilet seat to the work order. They come over and fix it, 2 weeks later I was notified of a $300 bill. Idk about yall but that seems unreasonable to me. So I call them up, they told me they\u2019d have to call me back with more info. I don\u2019t hear back from them. So I call them back and they tell me my dispute has been denied and that I have to pay up as the toilet seat is the tenant\u2019s responsibility to replace. I told them I need this in writing accompanied by an invoice. They agree, no email ever comes so I call 6 more times. Each time they told me they\u2019d email me same day and they never emailed me. So I start emailing customer service, they told me they\u2019d have a solution in 72 hours. I call the property manager again. They stated I don\u2019t have to pay the fine until it\u2019s resolved because customer service re-opened the dispute. So I had them email me stating everything they said on the phone and copy customer service into the email as well. I stayed on the phone while they drafted the email, so I did get this email. The property manager wouldn\u2019t supply an invoice and wouldn\u2019t tell me why. He talked like he would get it to me at some point. Fast forward 2 weeks still no resolution, follow-up, or invoice. Is there anything protecting me if I don\u2019t pay the fine, given how this has played out?\n\nPS - I spoke to two property managers, one told me it\u2019s my responsibility and says so in the lease, the other one stated I should always call and never do maintenance myself. The second property manager also started asking me for paper proof that I\u2019ve been following up on this issue for as long as I have. This whole thing has been so sketchy.",

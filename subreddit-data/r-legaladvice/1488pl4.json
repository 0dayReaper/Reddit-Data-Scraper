    "postText": "Autistic, Charged with Assault causing bodily harm.\n\nSo my Name is \u201cJ\u201d, I\u2019m from BC and last year i was arrested after stabbing my mother, and I was charged with Assault causing bodily harm. When the incident occurred I was coming off medication (Fluoxetine). I was having withdrawal effects, Delusions, Hallucinations and paranoia. At the time i was convinced my parents were trying to kill me and I hurt my mom in what i was convinced of at the time was \u201cSelf Defence\u201d which was not the case based on the reality of the situation. I also have, ADHD, Aspergers, Sensory Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Now the crown and my lawyer have been pushing for me not to have jail time and for me not having a criminal record. I have pled guilty to what I have done and this is my first Offence. What kind of punishment could I be looking at here??? I know that the maximum could be ten years in prison, but with my case i\u2019m not exactly sure what is going to happen to me? If anyone with any knowledge of this stuff could give me answers that would be great. I\u2019m from Canada.",

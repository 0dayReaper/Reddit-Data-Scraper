    "postText": "I'm just trying to figure out the legality of this and find out what my options are. Basically, the situation is this. My girlfriend moved to NYC last year with 2 of her friends that were already living there. They found a 3 bedroom apartment and one of her roommate's was able to secure her affluent dad as the guarantor, since he makes 80x the rent. Everything was fine for a year. Well, the daughter of rich guarantor is moving out. I was planning to move up there next around August. Her roommate's boyfriend was also going to move in, and the 3rd bedroom would've been taken by one person. Yes, 5 people in a 3 bedroom apartment.\n\nHowever, we are now in a situation where we cannot renew the lease obviously because of this changed situation. We have to apply for a new lease. We no longer have a guarantor. Our option is to either secure a guarantor that makes 80x the rent, or two people can qualify on their own if they make $154,000 annually combined. My question is why this is capped at 2 people. For a 3 bedroom apartment, If we combined 3 people's income, we would make well over this $154k. And this seems to be totally fair and reasonable given that it is a 3 bedroom apartment. If we do not figure out either of these two options, then they will have to vacate soon.\n\nI'm coming here to ask what my options are. I'm totally unfamiliar with NYC housing/tenants. Are we just screwed completely?",

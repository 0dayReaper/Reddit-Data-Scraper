    "postText": "That's about the gist of it. Banke reported it to the IRS in the amount of over 10k, the actual amount of interest was closer to 6.5K, and they had never sent me the 1099-int form so I had no idea there was even an error or issue until a few weeks ago when I get a letter from the IRS. My main question is, if I pay what I supposedly \"owe\", can I still get that corrected after the fact while I go after the bank for their screw up?",

Pull your bank statement showing the cashed bond (it will show the amount you cashed, assuming you put it into an account) and send that to the IRS along with a letter stating that the bank\u2019s 1099-INT was incorrect, here\u2019s the correct amount, and here is my proof (the statement). If you have records like the bond serial that\u2019s even better, use the savings bond calculator to pull up the interest and include that with the letter.",

There should be a mailing address for correspondence on the letter you got as well as a fax number\u2014I\u2019ve personally always used fax just because it\u2019s quicker and you get a confirmation it arrived but they process it the same either way. You\u2019ll usually get a letter back saying they received your letter and then a while after an actual reply in the form of a revised bill if you still owe or a zeroed bill if you don\u2019t.",

If you pay it now and the bank corrects the form later, the IRS won't automatically see that and refund you. You would have to then file a claim for refund.\n\nSince the IRS has already seen the discrepancy, you should first respond to them and provide evidence of the actual amount of interest received from that bank. If the IRS accepts your explanation, then there will be no need to get the bank to correct the form.",

    "postText": "I believe I've made a terrible mistake. I applied for a college and got accepted into it, but I didn't get all the scholarship/finaid money I wanted, and I saw that the college had a program where veterans could receive additional finaid money. The only requirement was to submit a dd-214, which is basically a government doc that proves military service, and so I decided to create a fake dd-214 and submit it to the college. However, soon after I submitted it I realized this may not be a very smart decision and now I'm wondering how likely it is I will get caught for this, and if there's any way I can reverse it? I'm too young to go to jail!",

Do they have any claim here?\n\nThey have been talking with a local legal advisor for over a year, but I haven\u2019t heard any significant steps forward. Should the process be taking this long?",

Your parents will need their info as far as their block and such. When they pass it on to the producer, they\u2019ll confirm it and get something rolling. \n\nThat\u2019s all I had to do when I found out Chesapeake poked some holes under my property in Louisiana.",

            "comment": "&gt;had run a line under their property\n\nWhat do you mean by this? If they\u2019ve \u201crun a line,\u201d that typically means it\u2019s a line carrying something (oil, gas, water, etc\u2026) that has already been produced. The rights to lay that line belong to the surface owner since it\u2019s not an extractive activity. \n\nConversely, a drilling rig that is drilling a horizontal oil and gas well will affect rights belonging to the mineral owner. You will need to have your parents confirm (with a title professional) that they not only own \u201cmineral rights,\u201d but that they own the oil and gas rights, as in WV it is not uncommon for \u201cmineral rights\u201d to have divided ownership where one party owns the oil/gas rights and another party owns \u201chard mineral\u201d rights for things like coal.",

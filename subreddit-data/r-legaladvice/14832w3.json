    "postText": "I've been called more then 30 times in the last 2 months. I have told them I don't speak to her and don't know where she lives. \nI blocked the number and they always call back from another one. One day they actually called me 5 times while I was at work from 5 different numbers. \nI didn't cosign any loan or even know where this place is. I haven't spoken to my sister in 5 years. She's always in and out of jail or rehab. Have no idea where she might be.\n I love my sister, but it was to much stress on my own family. So just cut her off.\nI live in Louisiana, is there anything I can do to stop this harassment. \nThanks",

They probably won\u2019t give you their address, since their behavior indicates they are quite possibly just scammers who don\u2019t care about the laws that govern real debt collection agencies.",

Your state has a statute that forbids/limits debt collectors from calling third parties, (w/o the permission of the borrower), but it\u2019s probable that your sister gave them permission. You can still send them a letter telling them to kick rocks, and you can complain to your state\u2019s attorney general if they continue contacting you after the fact. Send the letter via certified mail, keep a copy and the receipt. Keep a diary of subsequent contacts.",

You can collect $500 0- $1500 per call if you follow the steps below:\n\n1. Record the phone calls (if 1 party recording is legal in your state).\n2. State you do not wish to be contacted.\n3. After a handful of recorded calls, mail by certified mail a cease and desist letter to their registered agent (search your states secretary of state's website).\n4. File in small claims court for the violations up to the max in your area.\n5. Don't take the first offer, depending on the number of calls, their offers can increase to thousands of dollars.\n6. Make them file for dismissal when you have settled.\n7. enjoy your trip to Disney!",

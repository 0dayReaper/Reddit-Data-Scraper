    "postText": "My mom passed away last September. From the moment she passed, my stepdad did everything he could to shut me out of her estate. He refused to have the kind of funeral she told me she wanted, buried her as cheaply as possible, and gave away her stuff less than 48 hours after she died to his sister and my stepsister. Now, he refuses to give me a copy of her will. I\u2019m so upset by this. I have a great career and I\u2019ve been fully self supporting since I was 18 so it\u2019s not an issue of me wanting money. I\u2019ve never taken a dime from him or my mom so I don\u2019t owe them anything. I just want to see the will to make sure my mom\u2019s wishes were carried out. I have a sick feeling they weren\u2019t. How do I go about getting a copy of the will?  It has never been probated so it\u2019s not available through my local probate court.",

If your stepdad has a will for her, it will magically appear quickly. If not, he'll need to start realizing that you're likely owed something.",

I\u2019ve got a copy of it and I will call the probate court tomorrow and see if they have the will. I\u2019m wondering if he can refuse to probate the will?",

The stepfather and the rest of the family is grieving and may not be ready to deal with probate until a few weeks/months into the future.\n\nWhen they do eventually submit the will to the probate court, you will be sent a copy if you are named as a beneficiary in it.",

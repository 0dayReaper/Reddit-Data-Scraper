    "postText": "I took a payday advance in 2015 in Florida. I paid on it via the collection agency until 2016. No contact or payment has been made since then. The balance remaining was $600.\n\nI moved to New Hampshire in 2020. The agency is suddenly reaching out to me, my husband, and my mother (that I know of, possibly others). They have told both my husband (who did not acknowledge being my husband but asked why they needed to speak to me) and my mother that this was a payday loan debt and that I could face legal repercussions including jail if I do not pay the balance.\n\nToday I started getting texts and harassing phone calls. The reps are incredibly rude and have told me that the statute of limitations doesn't apply to this debt for some reason. That they will sue me in Merrimack county court (new Hampshire) since the debt is still 'valid.'\n\nThey're full of it right? When I looked into it the Florida statute is 5 years and New Hampshire is 6. It's been a minimum of 6 years, depending on when in the year it happened. But it doesn't reset when I move right? Like I only spent 4 years in Florida so now it has to be 6 full years of residency in New Hampshire to be past statute of limitations? That would be dumb but with laws I never know.",

The debt is still recent enough to appear on my credit report (although strangely it does not, knock on wood) but from my understanding should be past statute for a lawsuit.",

Once they started and you made payments, SOL is not relevant.  I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nFor example, if a crime is committed that has a 2 year SOL, the authorities have 2 years from when the crime is reported to bring charges.  If they bring charges within the 2 year mark, but it takes longer than the two year mark to make the arrest or start a trial, the SOL is not relevant.",

    "postText": "I currently work for a small fab shop in a small town just outside of Vegas NV. I\u2019m about to get a new job but I need advice on what steps I need to protect myself. Here\u2019s my problem.\n\n  I have worked for this shop for a year and a half as a \u201c1099\u201d. I\u2019m paid with checks. I barely make enough to live. I don\u2019t follow any of the guidelines that would classify me as a 1099. I don\u2019t make my own hours (mon-fri 8am-5pm). I am forced to work overtime with no overtime pay. He pays me a salary not an hourly rate. Same pay check every other week\n\n  My paychecks are never on time. When I was hired he said since it\u2019s still a small business he may need to have me wait to cash my check till the following Monday but really I\u2019m getting paid 1-2 weeks late. At one point I had to go 6 weeks without any pay. I have been paid in full but just have to wait far to long.\n\n  I am about to accept a new job and I currently don\u2019t have any money to pay taxes when it\u2019s time. My boss is 400k in debt and 5 years back to the IRS. Since I don\u2019t fall in the guidelines would he be responsible for back taxes? Is there something I can do? Any help is appreciated",

    "postText": "Throwaway account to maintain anonymity, as some of my colleagues are familiar with my Reddit handle. I'm in need of legal guidance concerning my workplace's handling of certain matters that have left me feeling unsettled. I am a male employee in a predominantly female department, and overall, it has been a positive experience for me. This job has been my favorite so far. However, recent events have made me contemplate leaving to pursue a different career (which I am currently studying for in my spare time).\r  \n\r  \nThe issue I'm facing is related to the birth of my child earlier this year. While my wife doesn't work at the same company, my employer granted me only a couple of paid days off (using my accrued PTO), along with a few unpaid days. In contrast, two of my female coworkers were given three weeks of paid leave. I've heard that according to Utah law, both parents are entitled to three weeks of paid leave. At the time, I didn't question this treatment because I didn't believe I had any legal grounds to stand on. However, several people have since informed me that I do, in fact, have a right to those three weeks. I'm seeking advice on my rights in this situation.\n\n[https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63A/Chapter17/63A-17-S511.html](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63A/Chapter17/63A-17-S511.html)",

    "postText": "I had an emergency about 10 months ago for appendix removal. The total was like 60k insurance covered all but 6k. I\u2019m 23 and a college student and trying to pay off my credit card. I simply cannot pay. It went to collections a few months ago. I haven\u2019t received any calls from there at all. I only got one email since it went to collections and one paper mail when I first got a notice. I\u2019m scared that they are waiting to sue me. I\u2019m on the house title that is paid off. It\u2019s my mother and I that are on the house title. I don\u2019t own any other assets. I live in North Carolina. What is going to happen? What should I do?",

    "postText": "Located in South Carolina. \n\nThis is a multi auto accident that did not occur at once. Here\u2019s what happened:\n\nWednesday June 7th, I was on the interstate and was rear ended. The state trooper deemed the Lexus at fault. I drive a 2021 GMC Sierra with the extended heavy duty ball hitch/coupler. This extends out about 4 inches past my bumper. The ball hitch went straight into her engine, and my bumper was pretty dented. When I pulled forward as instructed by the trooper, the ball hitch tore off her front bumper while tearing up her radiator. She was cited for driving too closely for conditions and is at-fault. I called my insurance agent who said to drop it off at the dealership. \n\nThursday June 8th, I dropped it off at a major Chevrolet GMC dealership collision center for a quote. Because the truck is still driveable, Progressive told me I do not have to leave it there. I was asked to leave it overnight for a quote. \n\nFriday June 9th, I received a call it was ready for pickup. The quote was as follows: replace bumper, trailer wiring, and some other misc. related parts. I asked if the structural integrity was compromised to which they said no. I asked if this will affect my towing capacity to which they said no - and further stated I could still tow in this condition (given I replace the ball hitch due to being warped and run auxiliary trailer wiring to be compliant with state requirements). I scheduled my collision repair for 3 weeks out. \n\nSaturday June 10th, I went to autozone and bought a new ball hitch and new trailer auxiliary lights. I attached the new ball hitch and lights. Everything worked as expected. I attached the boat trailer and safety chains. About halfway to the beach, I came up to a traffic light. As I was braking, the trailer hitch receiver (which bolts to the frame) snapped off the frame and the tongue of the trailer went into the pavement. The back of the boat slid off the side of the trailer and rested against the car in the lane next to me. I was cited for at-fault for failure to maintain proper equipment. \n\nNow for the legal questions:\n\nThe boat was properly attached to the trailer. It was winched on tight and secured by towing ratchet straps (which snapped under sudden momentum because the boat weights approx 13,000lbs). The safety chains were attached. All trailer lights were rigged to working. \n\nAm I liable for the damage to the car, damage to my boat trailer, damage to my boat, tow bills, and damage to my truck despite the collision center clearing my truck to tow? They clearly did not check the tow receiver or they would\u2019ve known the bolts would snap. \n\nI do not have it in writing that I was OK to tow (despite being told), but on the itemized repair quote, the tow hitch receiver was not listed. \n\nMy progressive agent is currently researching this with their legal department. The Lexus insurance from the initial rear end is claiming they\u2019ll only contribute to the itemized quote replacement, and the other insurance from the second accident is going after me for failure to check my equipment.",

            "comment": "1) The Lexus owner/insurance should pay for damage to the hitch that you can prove was damaged prior to the second accident. You have pretty solid evidence to prove. Hitches don't just break for no reason, and the timing helps your case there. Your insurance company and their insurance company can fight about this. It'll likely never end up in front of a judge/jury, but if it did, I think they'd make the Lexus owner/driver pay to fix the hitch that broke 3 days after the incident.\n\n2) The damages caused as a result of the hitch breaking while towing the boat (damage to truck, damage to trailer, damage to other car, tow bills) SHOULD be paid by the repair shop that was negligent in saying that you were clear to tow and that the hitch didn't need to be repaired/replaced. However, as to the other car, you are responsible, you would just then go after the repair place for any damages you have to pay to the other car owner because you are responsible for ensuring your equipment is safe to tow. \n\nAs a practical matter, lawyers and lawsuits are expensive and rarely end up in trials. In this case, your insurance should likely provide you with a lawyer that can contact the repair shop and reach some sort of agreement for them to reimburse some portion of everything. I would let your insurance company handle all of this for now. If for some reason they don't seem to be protecting your interests or handling it in a way that doesn't seem right, you could reach out to your own attorney for a consultation, but I'd probably wait and see if your insurance company can get it all straightened out first. It's certainly a complicated scenario, so I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a while for it to get sorted.",

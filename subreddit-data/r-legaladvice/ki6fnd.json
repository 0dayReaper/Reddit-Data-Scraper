    "postText": "To make a long story short, im a late 20 something living in portland oregon. I had a pretty intense emo/goth phase as a tween that i thought i had grown out of. \n\nA couple months ago, i was watching a nature program on our local station about crows. The program mentioned that if you feed and befriend them, crows will bring you small gifts. My emo phase came back full force and i figured that i was furloughed and had lots of time- so why not make some crow friends. \n\nMy plan worked a little too well and the resident 5 crows in my neighborhood have turned into an army 15 strong. At first my neighbors didnt mind and enjoyed it. They're mostly elderly and most were in a bird watching club anyway. They thought the fact that i had crows following me around whenever i go outside was funny. \n\nLately, the crows have started defending me. My neighbor came over for a socially distanced chat (me on my porch her in my yard) and the crows started dive bombing her. They would not stop until she left my yard. \n\nThey didnt make physical contact with her, but they got very close.\n\nAm i liable if these crows injure someone since i fed them? I obviously cant control the crows. I would rather them not attack my neighbors. But since i technically created this nuisance, could i be financially on the hook for any injuries?\n\nTo be clear, they're not agressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbors are out they are friendly normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.\n\nETA: TL;DR- I have turned into Moira Rose, queen of the crows. My inadvertent crow army has gotten aggressive towards others. If they hurt someone could i be held liable?\n\nETA PT II: I did not train these birds to attack. Also thank you for all of your awards. Im glad my stupid decisions bring you joy. Please consider donating that money to your local Audubon society instead",

You could also supply your guests little baggies of treats for them to offer up. If they dive bomb someone don\u2019t give them food for 24 hours. If they are nice to a guest, give them a high value treat to reinforce positive behavior. Advice from my partner, she was a field biologist that is published in biology/ornithology.",

That is going to be nearly impossible to show or \\*prove\\* without witnesses observing OP doing some sort of training, but like any lawsuits, not out of the question for a litigant to *ATTEMPT* to prove.\n\nThe 2 different scenarios are: 1) \"OP feeds these birds and they're really aggressive to everyone else.\" Neighbors witness OP walking outside, throwing out bird seed, and returning indoors. Assuming no additional facts, seems like happenstance and a very small likelihood of a plaintiff prevailing.\n\n2) Neighbor produces video of OP appearing to train the birds to dive bomb scarecrows that are dressed in old people sweaters and wide wale corduroys, giving them rewards/treats for successful impacts. This would likely be a problem for OP and would increase a plaintiffs chances of prevailing in a suit against OP for damages/injury.",

You might think that having all of these crows following you around is cool, but in fact you've created a situation that is damaging the crows and is putting them in danger. They are wild birds, you have done them no favors.\n\nTo start, you might simply start weaning them off of the feeding that makes them dependent on a human and also puts them at risk from other humans. Give them less and less food over a set time period. Do not interact physically with them. Consulting with a wildlife specialist in your area to try to undo the damage you have done would be a good idea.",

You may have inadvertently increased the number of crows that stay put, stressing the food supply. This is not to guilt you, many people do this when they leave bird feeders out past fall. Not idea, just be cognizant. \n\nThis puts you at a crossroads, feed them more to subdue the agresaion, or feed them less and let them disperse, however the aggressive behavior may get worse first. Putting out a bird feeder would probably solve your problem. They SHOULD shift the aggressive protective behavior to the feeder, and in the spring settle down. \n\nTo extrapolate a little, \nIn your shoes, I'd try to build a crow vending machine. You have their attention and can probably train them with ease. There are instructions around the internet for a variety of different builds. You make a machine that when they drop something they find in it, it dispenses food. This path also starts with a standard feeder.\n\nOn the legal side of things, some states do take issue with domesticated crows. I don't think attack concern is worry some as much as the game commission taking issue. I'm not sure where the line is between putting out a feeder and using a crow vending machine. Maybe someone else can provide more insight here.",

    "postText": "I was (indirectly) involved in a work accident a couple years ago that resulted in a death.\n\nI was a key witness and talked to detectives multiple times, and the case has since been closed. No charges were made as far as I know as it was a terrible accident. I never stepped foot inside a court room, and I haven\u2019t heard anything since the last time I spoke to police.\nWould it be possible for me to talk to the detectives again and ask questions? Would it be weird? Could they even give me any information about the case or is it a lost cause?\n\nI just had no closure. It has has haunted me since. Even though I wasn\u2019t exactly directly involved in the accident, it was very close to me, and very traumatic.\nI hope I can ask this here, any advice would be very appreciated.",

I think I had one detective\u2019s phone number at one point, but it has been a couple years and I don\u2019t think I do anymore.\nAlso I\u2019m in Utah. I put it in the title but I might not have been very clear.",

They probably won't be mad but don't be surprised if they don't call back or don't answer you.  \n\nI missed your state, sorry about that.  You can find some info about FOIA in Utah, including a sample letter [here](https://www.nfoic.org/utah-foia-laws/)",

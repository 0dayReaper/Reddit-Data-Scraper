    "postText": "I live in Australia and accidentally sent someone a long erotic narrative on Snapchat to the wrong person. It did have graphic wording (just Coc* and Ti*s and what we would do to each other) nothing too graphic. \n\nThey both had the same display name and I never realised it wasn't the one it was supposed to go to until I got notified that she had screenshotted the message and my profile. I tried to apologise but she had blocked me before I got the chance. My friend who it was supposed to go to then added her on Snapchat and apologised on my behalf and explained it was not meant for her. She was then also blocked without any response.\n\nIs this a criminal offence? In Australia. How long should I wait until I stop stressing?",

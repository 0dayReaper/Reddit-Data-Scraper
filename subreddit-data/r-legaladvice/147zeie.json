    "postText": "The first time our landlord walked into our apartment without notice we had no idea other than the locks on the door were done differently than when we left that morning (we don\u2019t deadbolt). We confronted him and let it slide. Second time he called and told us he was going to gather window measurements. Me and my partner were both at work so we asked him to please not walk in as our house was messy. He walked in anyways. We called and confronted him once again. We have a recorded phone call of the interaction. He yelled and screamed telling us that we shouldn\u2019t have problems with him walking in and \u201che\u2019ll try to give more notice\u201d and the phone got hung up in our face, our side of this call was calm, simply asking him not to do this again. We then put up cameras and have been living in fear and frustration for months. Our downstairs neighbor recently had the exact same thing happen.. a missed phone call, then the landlord walked in and helped himself to \u2018measurements\u2019. A different neighbor witnessed him walking home while the downstairs neighbor was gone. He\u2019s since put up cameras as well. We don\u2019t want to get kicked out of our home as there are limited rentals available in our area. What\u2019s the best course of action? Right now our plan is to lie low unless he walks in again and then call the police if it happens. Our downstairs neighbor has the same stance to our knowledge. We are close with them and have a mutual hatred of the landlord. Should we act differently before this? Is our plan the best course of action. We live in DE. The phone call where he admits guilt would not be helpful in court. Please help us. We live on edge everyday in our own home.",

Did you request maintenance or repairs? \n\nWhat type of housing is this?\n\nLandlords in DE are required to give 48 hours notice before entry unless you requested repairs or maintenance. Also, in DE, it's possible to waive the notice requirement in your lease, so you should see if you did that.",

We did not request this to be done and no issues with the windows that we made him aware of, although some of them functioned poorly. When he had the windows replaced he gave us a heads up within 48 hours, however left many questions about the replacement unanswered, rude but not illegal.",

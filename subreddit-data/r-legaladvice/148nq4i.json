Rate is significantly reduced. They tell me my only options is to apply or they consider it as a resignation. Is this legal? Do I have other options? I live in the US.",

Does it terminate and require renewal at the time that they say you would have to \"apply to get the job\" ?\n\n&gt;the consider it as a resignation\n\nThat's how employment works, not independent contracts.   \n\nIf you were properly a contractor, then your recourse is in your contract.   Your eligibility for unemployment benefits is based on your self-employment, not on working for that company.",

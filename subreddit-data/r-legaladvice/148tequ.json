Now something is going on (I don\u2019t even really get what) but now 3 different people have come to my house to look for him and it\u2019s getting really old. What can I do to get people to stop coming here?? If I put up a no trespassing sign is that gonna help? I keep telling these people he doesn\u2019t live here and I don\u2019t know where he is and they send someone else instead. Do I contact the police or put up a no trespassing sign or will that do nothing?",

    "postText": "Hello.\n\nI have a coach bus that I leave in regular street parking for when I don\u2019t use it. It is located right under an NYPD camera. I had a lock put on to deter anyone from entering the veichle, and left the state to care for a family member. I was gone for a week and a half, and upon returning I found graffiti on the side of the bus. No biggie, I called NYPD and filed a report who said they would handle it. A few days later, I went to go check on it again and found people inside the bus. I spoke to someone who lives there and apparently this has been happening since the first day I left it there, even after I filed a complaint. I immediately requested camera footage and they don\u2019t want to give it or properly investigate. What are my next steps?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, after some advice if possible. I\u2019ve received a letter from the local council in regards to a noise issue of dog barking late at night and early in the morning. \n\n\nObviously this complaint has come from out of neighbours (we are in a new build property so the walls aren\u2019t super thick!). \n\n\nWe believe this complaint to be largely unfounded, yes the dogs bark, but only when someone comes home, the late at night part that covers it would be around 22:30 (10:30PM) where our housemate returns from work. The dogs do not bark for an excessively long time, a minute or two tops, is there anything we can do legally as we believe the complaint to be vexatious.",

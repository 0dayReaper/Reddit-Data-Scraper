    "postText": "I (22f) have an abusive narcissistic ex (24m) who I completely cut off over a month ago. We\u2019ve been broken up for about two and a half months and didn\u2019t talk much prior. We dated about 2.5 years. \n\nSince I\u2019ve blocked him. He\u2019s reached out via his moms phone (I blocked it then he texted me from a random # shaming me about that) pretending to be her via text and guilting me. Telling me he wants to die because of me. I know this isn\u2019t her because she\u2019s blind as a bat and can\u2019t text. \n\nHe\u2019s texted me from a random number again saying he\u2019d hurt someone who raped me in the past. Wrong. He didn\u2019t know where he lived etc, generic name, there\u2019s no way. I ignored it. \n\nI blocked him from my dads phone number and he then proceeded to text him via Facebook saying we had a late term miscarriage and he\u2019s depressed. (I had an early abortion because I didn\u2019t want a child w him, and never intended to tell my dad\u2026 so he\u2019s airing my dirty laundry). \n\nHe changed his Instagram profile photo to be us, had posted a pic of me saying how much he misses me\u2026 called my brother. He showed up randomly at the house mid June (he has always shown up unannounced which made me feel unsafe. Thankfully I live w my parents). This is something I told him NOT to do. \n\nHe showed up around 2:30. I wasn\u2019t there so he left. Came back at 6:30. Wasn\u2019t there so he proceeded to tell my parents a ton of bad things about me. My dad put him on the phone and he said he needed his shit immediately. (He had nothing he wanted at the house as I\u2019d already cleared his things. He vaguely said he wanted \u201cknickknacks I don\u2019t care about, and photos in case we make up\u201d. It was a power play). He said if I didn\u2019t drop it off THAT NIGHT he would be back the same night. \n\nWhat the fuck?? Can I get a restraining order or what? He hasn\u2019t physically proven to do anything even though he has hit me, shoved me, gagged, etc me before. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI\u2019m nervous for myself but also my family because I just don\u2019t know the extent he\u2019s capable of or what I can do.",

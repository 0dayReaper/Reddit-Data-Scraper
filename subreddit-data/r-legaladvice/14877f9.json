    "postText": "I just split with my husband we own 3 pets 2 dogs and a cat, i kicked my ex out and I had custody of all 3 of them, for a 5 days when my ex came back to get some of his stuff he took the oldest dog he wouldn't leave my house until he had her, i got him to sign a agreement having her one week each but the moment his IVO was handed to him, him and his family refused to hand her over she is in his name but i have been financially providing for her for 10 years i was wondering should i fight to get her back or if i can sue my ex to get everything i paid for her back, she was registered in his name while we were married but i was paying for everything before she was transferred in to his name, she was in his mums name untill she was 8 years old she is almost 14 years old I live in Australia Melbourne, what can i do? Any legal advice would be great.\nP.S. my ex cheated and we are a not at fult country.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. Just looking for some quick advice although I suspect the money is gone forever. Long story short, a former co-worker owes me $200 I lent him when he was short on rent because I didn't want his kids or family going without. This was approx 2 months ago. After he was supposed to deliver the money in person or leave it in our safe (I've been gone for a couple days) they money isn't there and he hasn't yet responded to any of my (worded too kindly at this point) texts.  \n\nI figure that my kindness has been taken advantage of and I'm not getting the money back. I know you can sue someone for something as low as $20 but figure something like $200 wouldn't be worth anyone's time, right?\n \nTo note: I have some text exchanges that atleast has him acknowledging the debt, but no proof beyond co-workers being present and aware of the exchange, and a date in April where I withdraw a clean $200. That's it.\n\nThanks for your time, everyone.",

Then there is the issue of collecting on any judgement you might receive.",

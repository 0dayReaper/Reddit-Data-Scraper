    "postText": "This is a long one. In NC. My father was diagnosed with ALS 7 years ago. He has been getting worse and worse, and last year my mother lied to police officers to have him removed from the house. She dropped charges and order of protection when I posted on her Facebook what she did. She let him back in, but insisted he needed to move out so she could live her life. They worked out a handshake agreement that he would relocate to a 55+ home and she would make payments to him in the amount of $3k a month so he could afford to live and get this necessary care. After the first month she stopped paying him and is requesting they sign a separation agreement or else she will kick him off of her insurance. Not being able to afford his place, my junkie sister convinced him to find a place with her and that she would take care of him. Day 3 of that she and her boyfriend drained his bank account and left to Florida after threatening to kill us both. She had conned my father into signing her on his account because he is so disabled, so no legal recourse with the stolen funds. What is his legal play against his wife to try and get some of the martial property that they share(e.g the 1 million dollar house she is living in that they both have their name on). My father barely has $10k to his name and he is totally disabled and alone. His wife has all the money and all the assets. Trying to do the best I can to get him funds so he can get a nursing home. Thanks in advance.",

Hopefully, things would be split 50/50 and that would cover his medical/retirement costs (and mom wouldn\u2019t get everything she thought she would)",

Day 3 of that she and her boyfriend drained his bank account and left to Florida after threatening to kill us both.\n\nI'm not sure on the specifics to your state but frequently, taking advantage of a disabled adult/child is a crime in and of itself. [Here is the relevant law on NC's legislation website](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-32.3.pdf)\n\nMind you, if your sister is the sort of person you describe, there's a chance there might not be much left depending on how long it has been since this took place (and how long it takes the relevant authorities to act.)",

    "postText": "On May 7th of this year, my building\u2019s valet crashed my car so it\u2019s impossible to drive it (right rear wheel totally caved in). The valet has already admitted fault, and they assigned some people to my case. They said that all of my Ubers, cost for gas, rentals, etc. would be compensated.\n\nFast forward over a month and I\u2019ve received no updates. I still had to pay for parking on my bill, which is 300$/month. I talked a little bit with the person the valet told me to get in contact with to have them connect my Uber receipts (over 1000$ at this point) to the claim number via email but that\u2019s it.\n\nIs there anything I can do?",

Sometimes, it doesn't work out.\n\nFor example, my wife's car was totaled by a vehicle owned by the federal government . The issue was that the federal government doesn't carry insurance on their vehicles, they self-insure. Which means you need to document the damages and submit it to the government, which was an arduous process that even my insurance company wasn't successful with.\n\nIt still upsets me thinking about that person dropping the keys off with his agency and walking away from the problem while I am sitting there dealing with the headache he caused.",

And along with this comes a reduction in the overall premium. In this case the policyholder's interests are aligned with the carrier. If some of the deductible can be recovered, great. If all of the deductible can be recovered, GREAT! If no recovery is possible, well, all risk holders take the hit.",

Assuming that the valet has garagekeepers liability, subrogation should be successful, but it will take some time. During this time you will have to pay your deductible. Upon successful subro, you will get some or all of it back.  Good luck.",

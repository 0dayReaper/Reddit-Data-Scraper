    "postText": "(apologies if wrong sub)A family member is heading towards a divorce. Her and her husband have a house worth about $500k. They only owe approx $100k. The house is in the husband and his mother's name. Wife is not listed bc of bad credit. The mother moved out last month and the husband last week. Who could expect to get what in the divorce. (looks like it's gonna be a nasty one). Is it 50\\50 just because they're married? Does the mom get a 1\\3 of it? Etc.... Located in NJ.",

So maybe she'll get 25%. Or maybe she'll get 100% of the house and have to pay out the others. There are infinite possibilities. How much has she paid, when was it bought, remember, too, that  divorces are holistic.",

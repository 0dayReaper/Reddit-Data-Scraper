    "postText": "Are there lemon laws for washing machines and can I take a company like LG to small claims court?\n\nI have had 3 repair callouts for a brand new LG washer/dryer combo machine (delivered May1).  It was not working from the first day of delivery.  The LG repair tech tried to make some repairs and said in writing that the unit was not repairable.  They made him come back anyway. \n\nThey made him come back again May 25 and speak to the tech unit on the phone.\n\nI have not been able to get anyone to move forward with the process since that time.  Nobody will call me back, let me speak to anyone , or answer my emails.  They say they will escalate it but they don't.\n\nThe machine cost almost 2000$.\n\nThey are going to either keep sending out repair people till I have no more days off of work left or I give up .\n\nI reported to the BBB and they didn't bother to do anything .\n\nTheir headquarters are in NJ - do I have to serve in that jurisdiction?",

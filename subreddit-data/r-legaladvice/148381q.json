    "postText": "My spouse got into a car accident, and the circumstances are somewhat confusing (to me, anyway, as I wasn\u2019t there) and I suggested that he draw out a storyboard of what happened and send it to insurance so it\u2019s clear. He didn\u2019t think it was worth doing, though. The accident caused a decent amount of damage, but not major. There was a police report, but it seemed vague and the cop didn\u2019t put anyone at fault since he wasn\u2019t there. (And the other driver didn\u2019t admit fault to the cop.) There was a witness who was yelling for my spouse to get his number, but it was a busy intersection and honking horns and he couldn\u2019t get to him unfortunately. I say this only to explain my spouse should not be found at fault, but he recently learned our insurance decided to put him at fault, which is just crazy to me that they folded that easily and are interpreting things incorrectly. Is there any recourse to get the insurance to fight more for you? Should I get my spouse to create that storyboard and send it to our insurance? Should we hire a lawyer (that I\u2019m not sure we can afford)? Never been through this before, and want to make sure we do what we can.",

    "postText": "I live in South Yorkshire (if a more precise location is required please let me know and I\u2019ll make the edits necessary) and am wondering as to whether or not my parents will have the power to legally force me to return home should I go forth with my plan of leaving home.\n\nThe situation itself is rather simple, I myself have varying beliefs to my parents and they have chosen on multiple occasions to neglect any input on my part despite my concerns. This has led to various issues including a trip to a foreign country (during lockdown 2021 from March 13th to October 1st) despite my constant reminders that we were in a lockdown at the time and said country was seeing an increased amount of cases of covid-19 at the time which therefore indicated that it would become part of the \u201cred list\u201d of countries at the time. \n\nDuring said trip however, multiple events occurred however due to the nature of the legal system in said country would not be much use here as the events can neither be disproven or proven to have happened. The only real proof would be the mental scars and emotional repercussions which I have since faced or am facing at this current moment in time. \n\nA friend of mine and their parent, who is a help worker for those with disabilities if this has any relevance, has offered me a spare room in their home assuming I would be able to begin paying some form of rent given some time to \u201cfind my feet\u201d. \n\nIn regards to the living situation this would provide, I would have access to all the necessities of living I.e: clean water, access to food, a roof over my head etc etc (I\u2019m not too familiar with the requirements when it comes to housing so if there are any others I would appreciate them being listed thank you). In terms of the rent I would be paying, I have been told that it would be a small amount of \u00a3300 a month as they are aware of my current situation. \n\nIn regards to how I would pay Yh rent, I receive a monthly \u201cPIP\u201d allowance which would cover the ten and still leave me with a sizeable amount of money, I am also currently in the process of searching for a job however this is proving difficult due to my sight disability which is the reason for me receiving the previously mentioned \u201cPIP\u201d allowance.\n\nMy concern however is that due to me being 17 years of age, would my parents be able to take legal action and force me to return home. To my understanding, after turning 17 in the UK you are able to leave home provided you are in a safe living space with the basic necessities required to live however due to them being registered as my appointees in regards to my \u201cPIP\u201d allowance currently, I am unsure of as to whether or not they would have any leverage or standing in regards to forcing me to return home as this would impact their finances quite a bit. The primary reason for them being my appointees is however due to me being pressured into naming them as such when asked how I would like to proceed  with my disability allowance after turning 16.\n\nIf any further information is required or my post is deemed inappropriate please let me know (I also was unsure which flair to use however figured the family tags made somewhat sense) sorry for the lengthy post.\n\nTLDR: 17 year old, looking for advice on whether or not my parents would have leverage to bring me back home if I choose to leave home and stay at a friends house",

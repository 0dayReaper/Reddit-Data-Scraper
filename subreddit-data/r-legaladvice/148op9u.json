    "postText": "Landlord sent out a letter of intent to enter tomorrow asking that pets are \"put away\". The intent to enter does not specify a time, and specifies that only 10% of units at this complex will be randomly selected to be entered. Given that any inspection would reasonably include every room and that I'll be at work for 8 hours, can they demand that cats be put in a crate for 8 hours just in case they stop by?",

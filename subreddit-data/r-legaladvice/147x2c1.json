    "postText": "Hi there. Hope someone can help with any advice. I live in the UK and This is a burner account which I will check everyone now and then. Not an insane issue but it\u2019s incredibly annoying, irritating and unfair. There is a substantial amount of backstory which I\u2019ll skip.\n\nMy neighbours have been causing constant issues since I moved to the house. Specifically, they keep tampering with the cctv camera located above the garage which monitors solely our property and does not interfere or cause harm to their privacy. However they keep hitting the camera at night with a broom, actively tamper and adjust it when I\u2019m not there and cause menace. They also keep moving and kicking our potted plant on the edge of our property which prevents them from driving on our grass. I know this isn\u2019t a massive issue but imagine this occurring multiple times a week whilst being rude and aggressive to my family. It\u2019s not fair to deal with this and we have contacted police who sent PCSOs over who don\u2019t seem to take anything seriously.\n\nWould this constitute criminal damage? Or harassment?\n\nAny advice is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance",

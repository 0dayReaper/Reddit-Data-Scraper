    "postText": "*read disclaimer below*\n\nOn 8th June I had a sofa delivered. The delivery men made a lot of damage in my flat:\n- 12cm hole in the wall\n- scuff marks &amp; cracks in the wall\n- chips in the doors &amp; door frames \n&amp; more. \n\nI was not present during this, so it was just my sister in the situation (who has OCD).\nDuring the process of the damage the we\u2019re having a panic attack &amp; crying. \n\nThe delivery men after the damage &amp; on leaving put a \u2018damage waiver\u2019 contract in front of my sister (while they were crying and having a panic attack) and told her to sign it. I don\u2019t even think she had the chance to read it. \n\nThey took advantage of my sister in a vulnerable position while they were not of sound mind to sign a contract. \nAre there UK contract laws that cover vulnerable people or someone not being of sound mind that would make this contract void? \n\nThe delivery men had no respect of the space, were extremely unprofessional and threatened to take the sofa again. \nAnd I\u2019m in a position where we may not be able to get property damage and housing costs covered from the company because of this. Is there anything I can do? \n\n(I\u2019m also autistic so handling things like this is really stressful, I\u2019m doing my best, but I feel out of my depth)\n\nDISCLAIMER: the legaladviceUK subreddit no longer exists which is why I\u2019m on here. If anyone on here is from the UK or can pass me onto somewhere that can help please do so.",

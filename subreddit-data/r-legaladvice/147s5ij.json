    "postText": "I had a guy show up and ask about my car yesterday. He asked if it was for sale, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people ask, but I\u2019ve never considered selling it. If I ever did I\u2019d probably ask about 5 or 6 hundred for it.\u201d He asked if he could look at it, so I showed him the things I\u2019ve done to it and the work that needs done, some of the parts I had and so on. \n\nHe was about to leave and I asked for his name. He kind of mumbled it, I don\u2019t remember it, but he shook my hand and started walking toward his car. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back Friday with $600 and a trailer,\u201d and got in his car and left. I have no further way of contacting him and the last part happened so fast that I\u2019m still reeling about it.\n\nNow here\u2019s my concern, did I somehow enter a binding contract? Do I have to sell my car? Am I able to *not* sell it?? This is my first car and it\u2019s a project muscle car I\u2019ve been slowly piecing together. Very stressed and not sure what to do",

If you actually did agree, just tell him you changed your mind.\n\nIf he gets mad, just tell him to kick rocks.",

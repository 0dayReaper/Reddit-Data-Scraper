    "postText": "My landlord has failed to do anything about the wall shaking music coming from my\nDownstairs neighbors during the \u201cquiet periods\u201d established by our lease (such as midnight on a Monday.) Landlord insists they are communicating with these neighbors and suggests that WE involve the police, but that feels excessive.\n\nAnyways, I was wondering if anyone had any insight on if this is grounds for withholding rent. \n\nThese noise levels violate two noise footnotes in our lease, taken verbatim:\n\n8. NO DISTURBANCE OF OTHER TENANTS: The Tenant agrees not to play radios, televisions, stereo equipment, or any musical instruments or make noise that will disturb other Tenants or occupants in the Building. The Tenant recognizes the building's quiet hours as 10:00pm - 8:00am during the week and 11:00pm - 9:00am on the weekends. The Tenant shall not cause or permit any damages to the Premises or property of Landlord or of any other person at the Building. \n\n31. Tenant Disturbances. No noise or music shall be permitted at any time which in any way disturbs other occupants of the Property. In the event of complaints from neighbors or janitors, the Tenant will be subject to eviction procedures as set forth under Federal, State and local ordinance. Tenant shall not solicit, canvass nor conduct any door-to- door activities on the Premises. \n\nI appreciate any insight!",

            "comment": "No, you can not withhold rent in IL or Chicago over this. The landlord has no contractual obligation to you to ensure your neighbors do not disturb you. They are also correct that your proper avenue is to file a noise complaint with the non-emergency line of the CPD. \n\nThose clauses you cited are your contract with the landlord restricting your behavior. They do not force the landlord to enforce them against others.",

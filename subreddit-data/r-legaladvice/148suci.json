    "postText": "I attend university in South Carolina. My father, who lives in Virginia, allows me to use his car. I came visit for the first time in 6 months. When I crossed into VA, I was ticketed for lack of valid inspection. This was the first time I had ever been pulled over for any reason. I got the issue resolved ASAP and now the car has been inspected, I have proof of inspection, and the sticker on the car. \n\nI have to drive 6 hours back to VA to attend court. If I choose to waiver my trial, I can pay the ticket, but the ticket will give me points on my license + increase my insurance payment and I want neither to happen. \n\nPeople claim that if you remedy the situation (have your car inspected) and show up for court, then it will likely be thrown out. I tried calling a lawyer and they would charge $600 for any help. That seems like it could be more than the ticket. Do I need a lawyer? If I show up to court, is it plausible that the ticket would be thrown out? Must I ensure that I do not admit guilt?",

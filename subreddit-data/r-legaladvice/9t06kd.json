That was an easy fix for the officer, you could have proven ownership of the phone,but he probably didn't feel like doing a incident report, especially if he was there as a off duty gig. \n\nReport it, and worse case scenario, the officer gets reminded that he still has to do paperwork on overtime gigs. \n\nBest case scenario, the officer gets corrective action and the employee that stole it gets arrested. \n\nI know you don't want to bother with a complaint, and that's cool. I just say this to ease your fear. go see officer and the employee are going to be in a heap of trouble if that employee tries reclaiming that phone. But it may be in your best interest, to make a complaint, because the evidence vindicating you did nothing wrong (the video) will probably be gone by the time detectives looked into her complaint, if she was stupid enough to do it. I would call and file a report by phone to cover your butt. ",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

A Plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.\n&gt; \n&gt; The girl tried to say I was trying to steal her phone. I told the officer that I could unlock the phone and the girl could not, I told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. \n&gt; \n&gt; He refused to give me the chance or believe me. He told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. \n&gt; \n&gt; I left. \n&gt; \n&gt; The girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so I decided to check back 2 hours later. I saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. \n&gt; \n&gt; When no one was in her store and her back was turned I took my phone back. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before anyone starts going off on me for it, I know. I know exactly what I did was extremely stupid but I am still paying for that phone so...yeah. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am asking for the legalities of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. \n&gt; \n&gt; The place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that I am on video. My questions are simply did I break any laws?\n&gt; \n&gt; If the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and I was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did I break the law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Because even if there\u2019s video evidence of OP taking the phone, there\u2019d be further evidence that the phone was OP\u2019s to begin with.\n\nIn the time that it could take for OP to get cops to even try to get the phone back, the thief could pass it on to someone else, hide it, or destroy it. I\u2019m pretty sure the contents of that phone are worth more than OP potentially having to prove ownership. \n\nLegally, they are not at fault. What they should or should not do is irrelevant to that either way.",

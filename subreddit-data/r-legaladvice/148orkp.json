    "postText": "I am in Colorado, the other driver\u2019s insurance company is from Arizona. The other driver was at fault, my repairs are completed and now I\u2019m trying to get reimbursement for the rental from the at-fault driver\u2019s insurance. \n\nMy car was in the shop for nearly four weeks. My rental bill was a little more than $1300, $40/day and the per diem rate was approved by the insurance company beforehand. The insurance company says they just sent me $360 for \u201creasonable reimbursement\u201d and they say this is based on the labor time quoted by the repair shop. To be clear there were no delays in service, and I picked the car up the next morning after they notified me that it was ready, at which point I also returned the rental. \n\nAccording to Section 3 CCR 702-5-2-15-5: \u201c\u2026if drivable, [payments for third-party coverage for a replacement motor vehicle must] begin the date the vehicle is scheduled for repairs and left at the repair facility\u201d and these payments should not be discontinued until \u201cthe repaired vehicle is returned to the third-party claimant.\u201d So am I in the right to demand that they pay the entire rental bill? And if so, should I send them this section of the law along with a demand, or should I consider getting legal counsel first?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, the accident happened in Colorado and the other driver\u2019s car was registered in Colorado so I don\u2019t believe any Arizona codes or regulations would be applicable here.",

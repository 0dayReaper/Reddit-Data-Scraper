    "postText": "A scammer walked into a T-Mobile with a fake ID of my brother-in-law, switched my sister's SIM to a phone he owned to perform what is called a \"Sim Swap Scam\". He then stole everything from her online cryptocurrency accounts, and probably has info and access to every part of her life. \n\nT-Mobile ideally should be held accountable for allowing this to happen, but I'm not sure if it holds up because I haven't seen any cases that have won in this exact scenario. What can she do?\n\nEdit: A few details: We live in a Southern State in the US and the scammer walked into a TMobile store in California.\n Thank you so much for all the comments, there were many from every angle and give us things to think about. I love this sub!",

            "comment": "NAL but in IT. A \"SIM swap scam\" is an attack on account so that a scammer can get access to SMS of a phone number for use with two factor authentication. In other words, your sister's account was already compromised before the loss of the phone number. The person in question already knew they needed two factor authentication which means they had already compromised her account (either through phishing or social engineering and being able to reset passwords via answering questions). There is a possibility she knows who did this, but it is just as likely a phishing scam.\n\nYou will more than likely not win a lawsuit because the argument will be that you are blaming TMobile for having your phone mumber switched after your account was  already compromised.\n\nWhat you haven't mentioned is any steps taken to remedy the compromise which probably means your sister is still \"bleeding out\" from a tech perspective. What she needs to do is to go down the identity theft angle for her accounts, which entails change ALL of your passwords, phone numbers associated with her accounts, and password reset questions immediately. I would recommend using a password safe like keypass, bitwarden, etc. for maintaining said passwords and not answering the security questions with info that can be socially engineered (x grade teacher, paternal grandparent last name, first pet, etc.) but use either gibberish made from a password safe (and storing the answers in the notes section for said account) or coming up with random answers and still storing them in a password safe. If this isn't done she will be playing whack a mole with her tech life while accounts keep getting compromised. From a legal perspective, go down /he identity theft route. I believe /r/finance has a good wiki on what to do for identity theft.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.998375 71/193rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Can she win a case by sueing them for damages?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n&gt; A scammer walked into a T-Mobile with a fake ID of my brother-in-law, switched my sister's SIM to a phone he owned to perform what is called a \"Sim Swap Scam\". He then stole everything from her online cryptocurrency accounts, and probably has info and access to every part of her life. \n&gt; \n&gt; T-Mobile ideally should be held accountable for allowing this to happen, but I'm not sure if it holds up because I haven't seen any cases that have won in this exact scenario. What can she do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.998375 71/193rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

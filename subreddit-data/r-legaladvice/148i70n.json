    "postText": "Hey All,\n\nI recently damaged a friend\u2019s car while driving it in a collision with an inanimate object (I misjudged the distance between myself and parked truck). The car did not have physical damage coverage. The cost of repair exceeds the value of the car. I know that insurance companies can adhere to total loss laws in these instances, and effectively buy the car from the owner at the cash value. Do total loss laws apply to private parties or better said, do private parties have this same option? And even if legal what are your opinions on the fairness of repairing (at greater than actual cash value) vs replacing/repaying (at market and or cash value). Earnestly looking for a fair solution to this issue.",

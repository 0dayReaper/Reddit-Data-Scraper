    "postText": "(WI) Just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. \n\nLeft her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. \n\nOn the second day I was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman I had never seen before in my life. \n\nI jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she\u2019d found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman\u2019s intentions because there was a police station on this road.) \n\nI drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.\n\nI was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. \n\nThis occurred on Friday and I have yet to receive a response. I would like to know if I can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if I can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. Thanks. \n",

Your daughter was uninjured.   You cannot sue for injuries or damages that did not occur.\n\nYou may have somebody advise you that you could sue for \"emotional damages\".   You cannot successfully do so;  ordinary negligence and gross negligence that do not lead to death or grievous harm are a thousand miles from a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\nAs noted, you can (and absolutely should) make a complaint with the state licensing board.\n\n&gt;if I can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. \n\nI would advise you to take care and wait a day or more before doing so.    \n\n\nWhile the adage \"truth is an absolute defense to defamation\", it's an affirmative defense that must be raised in court.   You're making a serious allegation that is very likely to seriously damage the business, and if you exaggerate or deviate from the facts even a little, you're opening yourself up to a lawsuit for defamation.    If I were a parent to whom this happened, I don't think I'd be able to write a dispassionate, defamation-free letter about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

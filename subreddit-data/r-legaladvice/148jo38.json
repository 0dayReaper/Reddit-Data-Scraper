    "postText": "We rented from a company in North Dakota for two years and 11 months. We terminated our lease one month early, and they were able to fill the townhouse so that the last day of our lease was 6/12 ad midnight. \n\nThey are the largest renter (IMM is the name of the company) in the town with live in, in ND, and are basically a large corporate renter.\n\nWe paid a security deposit of $400, and then two security deposits totaling $500 for two cats - for a total of $900. Our lease was up last night and the language in our lease agreement differs from the century code - century code says 30 days.\n\nThe language in our lease says this : \"It is understood that $400.00 is required as a key, security, repair, and cleaning deposit. Said sum shall be held by the Agent as security for the faithful performance for cleaning or repairing any damage to said premises, or, at agent's option, any or all of said deposit may be applied to the payment of any overdue rent. At the termination of this lease, agent shall return to the Tenant, upon the return by Tenant to the agent of the keys for said premises, any unused portion of said deposit provided that the Tenant shall not then be in default of any of the provisions of this lease.  \n\\*\\* All carpeting is to be professionally shampooed upon termination and receipt of payment kept as evidence of service performed. Tenant shall be liable for any damages caused. Agent, at its discretion, may black light upon move out. Tenant will be responsible for the cost of the black lighting.\"\n\nThe Agent has had the keys to the property since 5/31 when we moved out. Does the language of the lease circumvent the ND Century Code saying 30 days? \n\nI don't have a great feeling and feel that IMM is going to try and screw us out of every dime they can...\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

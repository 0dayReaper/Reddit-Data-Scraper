    "postText": "Long story short I was given a ticket for allegedly running a red light that causes someone to hit me. The officer said he watched the video  cameras from the intersection and saw I ran a red but I know I had a green. The insurance said there are no cameras at the intersection and only thing is the person that hit me had someone in the car with them.",

    "postText": "This is in Ontario, but I want to know if he can legally do this. I started by asking if we could use a small portable washer, we were getting our laundry done at our parents but they're moving and it won't be an option anymore and the laundromat within walking distance is costly and really sucks, clothes end up coming home not very clean and still damp after spending 45 bucks on the machines, he said no, which kind of stung because I know the other 2 tenants in the building have portable washers and he knows about it but that is fine, I know he is able to say no to those because they are a huge risk for flooding and other issues. The problem I have is that I asked if a small manual fill washer (one small enough it sits on your counter and only holds around 6 litres of water) would be acceptable and when he refused that then I suggested a manual crank spin washer, he told me no laundry whatsoever. This is a problem as I am looking to get surgery soon, which will take a long time to recover from(he was informed of this fact when I was suggesting other solutions) and need some accessible way to be able to do my laundry and even going down to a manual spinner is really pushing it but dragging my stuff down the stairs and in a wagon to the laundromat is nearly impossible.",

    "postText": "I ordered a self install kit last week (still unopened) but circumstances have changed and I will no longer be living in the house that it got delivered to. I've called the 800 number countless times to cancel the contract / send back the equipment and they always direct me to the 'self install team' which never picks up. I've even clicked the '1' option so they can return the call, never happens. After calling back and venting my frustration they apologize and then transfer me several times, eventually I get an agent that sounds willing to help but they end up hanging up a few minutes later. The equipment is part of a 2 year contract that will start once I hook up the devices and bring them online- which I won't be doing and they're still in the closed box ready to ship back to them.\n\nI regret getting ADT and not researching their customer service reputation before signing up, but at this point what can I do?",

I AGREE THAT THE SERVICE CHARGES DUE UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE BASED ON MY AGREEMENT TO RECEIVE AND PAY FOR THE ADT SERVICES FOR TWO (2) FULL YEARS AND THAT ADT HAS RELIED UPON MY AGREEMENT AND HAS INCURRED COSTS IN DECIDING TO ENTER INTO THIS CONTRACT. IF I CANCEL THE ADT SERVICES OR OTHERWISE TERMINATE THE ADT SERVICES DURING THE INITIAL TERM OF THIS CONTRACT, OR IF ADT CANCELS THE ADT SERVICES DURING THE INITIAL TERM FOR A REASON SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 20(B) BELOW, I WILL PAY ADT 75% OF THE TOTAL REMAINING MONTHLY SERVICE CHARGES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ME HAVING TO PAY THE FULL REMAINING SERVICE CHARGES. THIS AMOUNT IS A CONTRACT TERMINATION CHARGE AND IS NOT A PENALTY. THE AMOUNT IS PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY IN FULL. NO CONTRACT TERMINATION CHARGES ARE DUE IF I TERMINATE, OR IF ADT CANCELS THE ADT SERVICES, DURING THE THIRTY (30)-DAY RENEWAL PERIOD(S). THIS CONTRACT TERMINATION CHARGE IS SEPARATE FROM, AND IN ADDITION TO, THE AMOUNTS I OWE UNDER THIS CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF MY EQUIPMENT (EQUIPMENT PRICE AND INSTALLATION COST). I AGREE TO PAY THE UNPAID BALANCE OF THE TOTAL EQUIPMENT PRICE AND INSTALLATION COST, IF ANY, IN FULL IMMEDIATELY UPON TERMINATION OF MY ADT SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW.3. INCREASES IN CHARGES. ADT has the right to increase the service charge at any time after the initial two (2)-year term. If I object in writing to the increase within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, and if ADT does not waive the increase, then I may terminate this Contract for ADT services effective thirty (30) days after ADT's receipt of my written notice of termination.**",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve never caught myself in any bad situations with law enforcement so this is all new to me. I\u2019m 25 and have a clean record, besides speeding tickets from highschool. I also have a Utah medical marijuana card. I was camping this weekend with a buddy who does not have a medical marijuana card and he decided to smoke weed out of a pipe which it is illegal to combust weed under Utah state law. My buddy set the pipe down and a ranger walked up and asked to see the pipe. He asked a few questions about ownership and I said it wasn\u2019t mine. I told him I had a weed vaporizer which I showed him as well as my medical marijuana card. I didn\u2019t smoke out of the pipe and told him it wasn\u2019t mine. He confiscated the pipe and took my license and medical marijuana card with him. My buddy was not asked to identify himself and wasn\u2019t asked if ownership was his. The ranger completely disregarded my buddy. Later the cop came back and charged me with 2 counts or paraphernalia. This doesn\u2019t seem like a valid case to me as nothing was mine and I felt I was only changed because I had a medical marijuana card and this ego driven cop wanted to make an example. This doesn\u2019t seem like a full investigation was attempted by leaving another individual  unidentified or without questioning when he is in the same vicinity of the crime being committed.",

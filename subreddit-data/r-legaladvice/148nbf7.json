    "postText": "San Jose, CA.\n\nMy lease includes a carport (which by definition is covered). In March, the carport cover blew off during a storm. The landlord texted me that they were aware of the damage and would arrange for repairs.\n\nA month later, the landlord sold the property. They had still not completed the repairs.\n\nNow there is a new owner. 2 weeks ago, I went down to my car in the morning to find the windshield was cracked. I can only imagine something must have fallen onto it in the night since the carport is no longer covered due to the damage.\n\nThe landlord (new owner) has now repaired the carport but is ignoring my requests to cover the cost of repairing the windshield. It\u2019s difficult because I obviously have no proof that\u2019s when the windshield cracked.\n\nAm I entitled to a rent reduction or backpay for those months that the carport was not covered and therefore not all the terms on my lease were met? Is there anything I can do to recover some money from the landlord to be able to pay for the damage that his neglect caused to my windshield?",

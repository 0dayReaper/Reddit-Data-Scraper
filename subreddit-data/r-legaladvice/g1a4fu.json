    "postText": "I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. \n\nI have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. \n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. \n\nIn December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): \n\n\"Jess, \nI want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. \n\nAt this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. \n\nL, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. \n\nAs always, she would love to see/hear from you.\"\n\n\nshe replied to that email a short time later with \"thank you for the update\". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. \n\nAfter coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. \n\nIn January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:\n\n\"Jess, \nI wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. \n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\" \n\nand then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:\n\n\"Jess, \nIn addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.\"\n\nShe replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. \n\nWe did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. \n\nFast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. \n\nI told her that unfortunately we didn't have any \"left\", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. \n\nA few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for \"failing to offer her our shared child's cremains\" and \"offering a used necklace\" and some other nonsense. \n\nI'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? \n\nI'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?",

There is no reason to communicate with her besides through lawyers.   \n\n\nI would exercise that right. It's the only sensible thing I would do if I was you. All the other things I would do in reaction to this... psychopathy... would be ill-advised and probably illegal.   \n\n\nSo ask a lawyer to handle all communications. I'm so sorry, my friend.",

I'm going to base my reply under the assumption that you were legally granted full custody.  I'm a former CPS worker in another state, that being said, there is some commonality of law for expedience and fairness that is generally universal.\n\n1) When a parent is granted full custody, that doesn't mean the other parents rights are modified.  \"Sole custody\" typically means one parent is legally removed (along with their rights to the child) from the child's life\\*\\*.  If this is true and you have sole, full custody, then the child's biological mother has no legal rights to anything pertaining to this child, even in death.  If you have a court order that says you are the child's only guardian, that's your golden ticket and no legal action will go further than you presenting that during a discovery phase, assuming she can find an attorney to take this at all.\n\n2) You have some type of written evidence that you offered the mother some of the child's ashes.  Based on my previous point, you are under no legal obligation to offer this woman anything.\n\n3) The fact that biological mother read it and changed her mind a month later doesn't change your legal duty to her.  Even if you're trying to give notice to another party (which you weren't obligated to do) any method that is believed to reasonably give notice is appropriate.  The fact that she replied to your email is proof that she read what you sent her and the nature of her reply says that she understood what you were asking her.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's assume that mother's legal rights to the child weren't modified other than allowing you to be the custodial parent.  Mother was notified about the child's remains and stated she didn't want them and you did with them as you saw fit.  Did the child herself make any statements as to what she wanted done with her ashes?  Even if she did, as a minor, you would have final say.  \n\n\nA lawyer is in the business of taking cases they can win.  Let her pay an attorney and let them turn her down.  Don't throw money at this, it'll set a bad precedent going forward.  \n\n\\*\\* Unless you're a tribal family and covered by ICWA.

Even if she has something in regards to thst she has to show you caused it. By stating she didn't want the ashes in writing, she essentially waived/relinquished any (if at all) rights she had. The cause for her emotional damage is her changing her mind which I believe you did not cause.\n\nIf the letter is signed by an attorney you should seek your own counsel, it's not worth the headache/stress (sorry for your loss). If it's simply signed by her then I'll leave it up to you but personally I would write back to state that you declined the ashes and the fact that you changed your mind when it was too late is not your fault.",

Additionally, her argument is that she was caused emotional distress by you not giving her any of the ashes, but you have email proof of her rejecting your offer. If you get a summon you can consult with a lawyer. Additionally feel free to call the law office she sent the letter from to see if it's legit or not, you can spoof your number if you want.",

Let all communication going forward be through your lawyer, save yourself the heartache and stress. You've already been more than considerate of her feelings and needs surrounding this loss and there's no reason to pay her off just because what she's given up is finally hitting her and she's chosen to take that out on you.",

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.998375 71/193rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "My friends daughter who is 17 and lives in Florida traveled across state lines to Indiana and had sex with a M22. \n\nDid the M22 commit any crimes? The age of consent in Florida is 18 but it is 16 in Indiana so how would that work? \n\nAlso, would Romeo and Juliet laws apply at all in this situation?\n\nEdit: The state-level age of consent is base don where the state is at correct? So since Indiana is 16 he is legally all to have sex with her in Indiana on the state level right?\n\nHowever on the federal level the age of consent is 18, but I can only find codes that state it is against the law only if he brings her across state lines to do so.. however she was on Vacation and messaged him to meet up after she was already in Indiana, so its not as if the M22 pre planned the arrangement and her daughter has admitted that she is the one who sought him out.",

            "comment": "&gt; since Indiana is 16 [it is legal to] have sex with her in Indiana on the state level right?\n\nYes.   For purposes of Indiana criminal law, a 17-year-old can consent to having sex with an adult partner.\n\n&gt;would Romeo and Juliet laws apply at all in this situation\n\nFlorida's 4-year-difference law might or might not apply if the couple had been in Florida;  their precise birthdays would matter.  But that law doesn't apply in Indiana.\n\n&gt;only if he brings her across state lines to do so\n\nThat's correct:  it's a Federal crime to transport a minor (or cause them to be transported, or solicit them to travel) to another state for the purpose of circumventing the age of consent law in their home state.   It's 18 USC 2423(a) if you're interested in the details.\n\n&gt;its not as if the M22 pre planned the arrangement\n\nThat would probably end any Federal interest in prosecuting;  if the M22 didn't solicit or pay or transport his underage partner, then that's an important missing element of the crime.",

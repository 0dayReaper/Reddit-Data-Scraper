    "postText": "I have Power of Attorney to care for my living father and to manage his estate.  I consulted a new lawyer to discuss what my duties are and to make sure I'm fulfilling them adequately.  In reviewing the PoA, the will, as well as a codicil that names me as executor of his estate, he said the codicil is no good.  The only explanation I could get out of him is that it's missing language and his would be 3 pages long.  He of course wants to write a new one for me ($$$).\n\nAm I being too paranoid?  Should I find a new lawyer, or is he correct?  (I already paid a consultation fee, I'd rather not pay another, but if I have to...).\n\nCodicil:  [https://imgur.com/a/BpmJ3Uw](https://imgur.com/a/BpmJ3Uw)\n\nI'm not sure who the notary was, the witnesses are unrelated neighbors, and my Father signed it.  All were present together.",

I left off that it is much more debatable that he is mentally competent these days than in 2017 since he's been experience symptoms of dementia the last 6 months. So it's important for me to ascertain if there is something wrong with the codicil, since redoing the will opens the possibility of challenging his competency.\n\nI'm leaning towards the codicil is fine, and the lawyer is trying to make a buck. I think I'll leave as is and find a new lawyer.",

I'm not even sure what is meant by that -- is the attorney saying the codicil is invalid, or that the codicil does not do what it is supposed to do (i.e., drafting problem).\n\nWhat I can say is that if there is a problem with the codicil that is fixable now, and if someone were to contest the current codicil after your father passes, the cost of that contest will be many times greater than the cost of making a new codicil.\n\nOf course, making a new codicil now presumes that your father still has the necessary mental capacity.",

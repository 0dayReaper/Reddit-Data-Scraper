    "postText": "Ok these are the facts:\n\n1. 2 years into renting this flat in London, it\u2019s very peaceful with front and back garden that is \u201cshared\u201d but more decorative and provides sound proofing for the flat as the flat is on a major London road, no one has ever \u201cused\u201d them.\n\n2. A new neighbour just moved into a 3rd floor flat. He is the boyfriend of one of the flat building managers.\n\n3. The flats are not tiny but not massive, he has bought a big and medium size dog with him.\n\n4. He lets them run without a lead down the stairs and out into the front garden where they are all day barking and \u201cplaying\u201d\n\n5. The front garden is directly connect to our bedroom window and no one else in the flat as we are ground floor, the other neighbour who is ground floor is on the other side, she is also on the housing management.\n\n6. They shout bark and play all day outside and leave the front door on the latch or propped open, I go out and shut it and an hour later the latch is on again. \n\n7. The other downstairs neighbour throughout the time we have lived in the flat has been really on us about noise, the rare occasions we would have people over she would find us the next day and say you are lovely neighbours but your one friend is far too loud. Things like that, which I don\u2019t mind. However she has mentioned nothing to the dog owner and actively plays with them outside my bedroom window. \n\n8. We politely messaged int he group chat about the security of the door and how it was making the road loud really loud in the flat, she politely backed us up on that point. \n\n9. I guess the point is it is SO LOUD, I was at the pub which is 100 yards away, with a two large apartment blocks and a row of shops between and lots of trees, the sound of the south circular road, and in the pub garden I could hear the dogs.\n\n10. The dogs chase me in and out from my front door until the stair case, I was in tears just with how overwhelming it is and the neighbour sits there and does not call them back over.\n\n11. I have said, quite sternly that I will not be putting up with this every time that I want to leave or come home, and that I won\u2019t be engaging with them. \n\n12. Postmen have started leaving out packages outside, this has never been done previously.\n\n13. There are parks less that two minutes away from the flats.\n\nBasically, is there anything I can do\u2026",

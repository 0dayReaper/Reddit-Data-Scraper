    "postText": "If u have a Qui Tam case how do u explain it over the phone and email? \n\nIm trying to help my friend but the PI the lawyers assign isn't understanding. We broke it down Barny style for him and he still didn't get it. We gave him the violations and showed the law and cases like the one we have and proof but my God, Its like he never heard of fraud. Gave him the contract and he didn't understand any of the legal terms. What do I do? My friend broke down cause he lost his job over this and its like no one is getting it.\n It hard to understand case how the money flowed.. but I feel like my time is being waisted and his time. \nShould we find a lawyer im person to talk to?",

            "comment": "Your post is incredibly unclear.  If you're explaining things in this same way to the PI, that may explain why. I'm not sure why you're explaining a contract and legal terms to a PI. It doesn't sound like you are a party to what happened, so that may also be adding to the confusion. \n\nYou asked about finding a lawyer in person. Is your friends lawyer not \"in person\"? What happened, and what is your legal question?",

                    "comment": "Ok im a part of it but didn't get fired. Basically have a pass through. Where a contract used there status a minority business to win a sub on contract. Then then hired there friends company to do the work and fill out all documents saying the subs name and not the friends company. Government has no record of this company aloud in this building or approved on this contract at all. \nThe friends company then kept all the entitlements and per dium for us worker and paid us less then the goverment wage determination, and black people less than everyone else. \nThe hired people as employees and labels them 1099. \nThe prime knows this and says if we do anything we will never work in contracting again. Prime helped plan all of it and even fill out documents with friends company.\nMillions of dollars being stolen from goverment. \nDocuments, messages, and emails prove it all out in time line we made. \nBut the PI the lawyer gave us to wants to play telephone and doesn't get the whole thing. Cause there are more players in this but that is the basics. \n\nShould we seek help from another lawyer cause the PI is just not understanding it. \nIts a lot to explain but the cover up was pretty good at first.",

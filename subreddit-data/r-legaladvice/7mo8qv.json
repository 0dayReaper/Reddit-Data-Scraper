    "postText": "Well, here's my update! And with good news!\n\nSo first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said \"Sand is a weird name for a guy\" had me in stitches.\n\nThat said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was \"his house\", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.\n\nI know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. \n\nYesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as \"the sin of homosexuality\", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. \n\nWe ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could \"lay down the law\" or \"set me straight\". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.\n\nHe still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).\n\nThe past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\n\r  \nI have a very elderly father with medical debt which has been mostly paid by his insurance.  I am the point of contact. I have spoken with the collection agency about six months ago about the debt, told them my dad isn\u2019t in good health, is living on limited income, and doesn\u2019t have the ability to pay the debt.  I told them I\u2019d get back to them if / when he\u2019s able to pay.  As the months have gone by, they have increased their phone call collection efforts, sometimes calling me multiple times per day within a few minutes of each other.    I don\u2019t pick up because I know from the caller ID it\u2019s them.  I have looked at 12 CFR \u00a7 1006.14 - Harassing, oppressive, or abusive conduct.    \r  \n\u201c. . . \r  \n(2) Telephone call frequencies; presumptions of compliance and violation.\r  \n(i) Subject to the exclusions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a debt collector is presumed to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and FDCPA section 806(5) (15 U.S.C. 1692d(5)) if the debt collector places a telephone call to a particular person in connection with the collection of a particular debt neither: . . .\r  \n(A) More than seven times within seven consecutive days; \r  \n. . .\r  \n(ii) Subject to the exclusions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a debt collector is presumed to violate paragraph (b)(1) of this section and FDCPA section 806(5) if the debt collector places a telephone call to a particular person in connection with the collection of a particular debt in excess of either of the telephone call frequencies described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.\u201d\r  \nThis is their call pattern from the last 14 days:\n\n\r  \nDate\t\tTimes called\r  \n6/12/2023\t4\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/9/2023\t2\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/8/2023\t1\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/7/2023\t2\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/6/23\t\t2\t\t\t\t\n\n11\t                7 days and 11 calls\r  \n\r  \n6/5/23\t\t2\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/2/23\t\t2\t\t\t\t\r  \n6/1/23\t\t4\t\t\t\t\r  \n5/31/23\t        4\t\t\t\t\r  \n5/30/23\t        2\t\t\t\t\r  \n  \n14\t                7 days and 14 calls\r  \n\r  \nDid they not violate the FDCPA because there are no calls for seven consecutive (one after the other) days?   They always seem to take a break in the days so they don\u2019t violate the rule.  \r  \n\r  \nI looked here and these examples aren\u2019t helpful because it\u2019s not clear if they the creditor is calling every day.  It says, \u201cover the course\u2026\u201d \r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1006/14/#b-2\r  \n\r  \nThis is awful.  It seems like the way I read the rule, they could call me every other day seven times and not violate this particular rule.   Thank you in advance for any feedback you can provide.\r  \n",

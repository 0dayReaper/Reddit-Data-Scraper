    "postText": "Submitting this on behalf of a family member currently residing in Colorado.\n\nLast week, a family member had a repair done on their Jeep at their local Jeep dealership involving a diagnostic and fuel pump replacement.  The pump failed less than 24 hours after leaving the dealership.  Now, upon returning, they have been informed that because the pump was not an OEM part, the labor is not covered under warranty.  This was not disclosed prior to the work being done.  Also, the OEM part is not even manufactured anymore, so the 3rd party part was the only option presented.  So, essentially the shop is telling them that there was never any circumstance under which they would have warrantied their work, which has now failed less than 24 hours after leaving their shop.  This seems... dubious.  I do not live in Colorado, and am unfamiliar with local laws regarding service warranties.  Is there any recourse here, or are they really stuck with a several hundred dollar labor bill twice over?",

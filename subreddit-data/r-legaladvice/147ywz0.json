    "postText": "Hello,  \n\n\nSo I am moving with my gf to Southern California, and we ended up signing an offer to rent for an apartment. Since then they have received my holding deposit and almost completely stopped communicating with me. The \"move in\" date is next week and we still don't have an actual approval, and without it, I can't properly plan my move. Digging deeper I find reviews of poor property management and disregard for tenants' maintenance requests.  \nEssentially, I am no longer interested in moving into the property due to the lack of communication and the property management neglecting tenants.  Okay, boring stuff is  out of the way, now the legal part. \n\nThe Offer to Rent says the following:\n\n&gt;Once Owner approves Applicant and accepts this Offer, Applicant agrees to sign a Rental Agreement for the premises. Applicant understands that once this Offer is accepted, the premises are taken off the rental market and reserved for Applicant, and potentially other applicants are turned away. If Applicant, after being approved, chooses not to enter into the Rental Agreement as agreed, and pay the first month's rent and security deposit, Owner may deduct \"rental damages\" from monies received with this Offer to cover the lost opportunity to rent the premises. Rental damages constitute an amount equal to 1/30th of the above Monthly Rent for each day the premises are vacant from the date Applicant's tenancy was to begin, to the date tenancy commences upon re-letting, not to exceed 30 days. Owner, within twenty-one (21) days after the premises are re-let, shall return to Applicant, to the Applicant's address shown on the Application to Rent, any balance remaining, with an itemization of Owner's damages.\n\nSo my question is, can I withdraw my application or cancel the process even after signing this contract? The contract states that once the Owner approves me, I have agreed to sign a Rental Agreement otherwise I have to pay the penalties stated above. So what I am assuming is that since I haven't been approved, I can walk away without having to pay the \"rental damages.\" Can they make the case that I have to?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you very much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

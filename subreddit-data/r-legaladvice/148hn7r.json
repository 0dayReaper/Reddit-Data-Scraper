    "postText": "The perpetrator broke into my car and a coworker\u2019s. We have it on video. He didn\u2019t steal anything, but we each spent about $200 replacing the windows. The perpetrator is 17 years old. He was arrested a few weeks later after he shot a security guard while trying to break into cars somewhere else. He\u2019s facing a homicide charge.\n\nDo I have any hope of recovering the money I spent replacing the window? Would I need to sue the perpetrator or his parent/guardian?",

            "comment": "Often this perpetrator will be ordered to pay your losses as part of their criminal prosecution.  You can reach out to the victim's advocate in the jurisdiction where this happened and make sure they know there are losses to be ordered in restitution. \n\nYou can also sue the perpetrator.  Over $200, I guess I'd probably roll the dice on restitution rather than sink time and more money into this, but certainly you can reach another conclusion.  \n\nRestitution is pretty hit or miss.  It isn't uncommon for people to never be paid.  But in this instance where the perpetrator presumably has parents and has a relatively trivial amount to minimize their sentence or impact, your odds are better.",

    "postText": "I am a tenant in Massachusetts.\n\nI have very serious mold illness. I almost died from mold exposure in my last apartment. This exposure would not have harmed a normal person (unless they had some kind of asthma or allergies).\n\nOften mold is a subtle thing, that cannot be easily perceived by people who do not understand mold and mold illness. My landlord, for instance, has refused to address a water-damaged moldy particle board under my sink (and the moldy area under it), because it is not green or black- yet.  I have the area sealed shut for now.\n\nMy situation is: I have some moldy laminate flooring and need to get rid of the mold.\n\nI was careless and got a lot of water on a laminate floor that is unsealed- my fault. This created subtle mold under my laminate floorboards in a small area. There is a musty odor but no other sign yet. The boards need to be replaced after sanitization of the boards and the under floor.\n\nCan I legally have a contractor raise the boards, clean under them and replace them? Since it doesn't change anything about the place at all, it doesn't materially change the apartment. Or does it?\n\nI can\u2019t prove the mold is there, so I don\u2019t see how to get the landlord to do it.\n\nI can get a doctor's letter asking for this, but can it be enforced if there is no physical evidence that there is mold under the floorboards?  I am not aware of any way for me to prove this. Does the landlord have to do it unconditionally if requested by my physical for disability accommodation?\n\nIf I can't get this fixed, I either have to move, or I have to seal off the room entirely and stop using it. Moving would be extremely difficult and expensive. Help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Text from my lease- \"You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment  \nand not damaging or littering the common areas. Unless authorized by statute or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or otherwise alter our property.\"",

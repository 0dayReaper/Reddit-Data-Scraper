    "postText": "I am a wedding DJ and was at a event this weekend where a member of the wedding party was injured. This was due to a fall where the guest hit their head on a window sill and got a laceration. After the incident I noticed one of my light stands was leaning against a wall and had been bumped by the guest. \n\nThis same guest had also hit their head earlier in the day while they were being carried into the room on a chair during a grand entrance around 2 hours before this incident. This guest had also been drinking prior to and in-between both incidents.\n\nThe guest was transported by ambulance and fire/police were on site as well. Immediately following the incident other members of the wedding party were heard saying he is drunk and is going to feel embarrassed afterwards. At the end of the event while I was cleaning up I noticed the spot on the floor where the venue had placed paper towl after cleaning up blood and it was a good distance ~10ft from where the light stand that was bumped was setup. The guest may have caught the leg of one of the stands and then stumbled a bit before falling and hitting their head. I feel that the guest had to have been running / walking fast and tripped in the process in order to land that distance away.\n\nI received a call from the spouse of this guest two days later asking for details on insurance and about filing a claim. The spouse mentioned the venue manager reviewed footage and spoke with staff and they came to the conclusion that the guest tripped on one of my light stands that was in the area. I have liability insurance which covers myself and my equipment and any injuries caused to guests due to my equipment. Should I be concerned about any other legal items that may arise outside of claims for medical expense coverage through insurance?\n\nThis is the first time I have had to submit a claim and I have been a tad stressed out over the entire process. The venue was not setup well with tables packed in with very little room to walk around outside of the dancefloor area. When I arrived to the venue the space chosen for me had barely enough room to fit my small ~12\" x 16\" base speakers on either side of the table that was provided for me. There was no room for my lights in that area so I chose to place them against the wall behind the head table facing the dancefloor. There was just enough room to squeeze in front of the lights while others were sitting in that area. These are not tiny tripod stands and were very visible at the time. Daylight hours with sun shining in windows and indoor lights were all on at the time. This also happened during the first dance and I have a bit of concern the bride may also now voice concern over the incident ruining their dance. No concern was mentioned following and they continued dancing as other guests tended to the fallen guest outside the venue prior to EMS arriving.\n\nAny advice on questions I should ask the venue management? Should I ask for any video evidence from them if they have any? What process should I expect from a claim submitted to insurance? Or am I stressing out early on and should I allow the insurers to handle the process?",

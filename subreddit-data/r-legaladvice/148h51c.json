    "postText": "My STBX filed an emergency order of protection against me. Illinois immediately suspended my FOID, preventing me from possessing firearms. When my lawyer and I were able to get in front of a judge 2 weeks later, the emergency order was dismissed and vacated, which should restore my FOID rights. How do I get my FOID un-suspended?\n\nThere's nothing on the FOID web self-service portal. The Illinois State Police have several emails and phone numbers listed for firearm and FOID issues but they either don't work or nobody responds to them. There seems to be several different appeals processes, some of them run by the State Police, and some by another committee that was set up in January, but none of them seem to apply to my situation, and again, they all ask you to email the appeal, and I never get any responses, so it's unclear if anything is even working.",

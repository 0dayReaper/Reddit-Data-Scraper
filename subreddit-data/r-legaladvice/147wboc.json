    "postText": "I'm in an abusive relationship that I'm trying to get out of. He called cops on me for scratching him, while I begged him to help me out with our toddler and he is scrolling through dating apps and talking to his affair partner whilst the kid is ill and I had to work from home. I live in his place and currently looking for a private rent and I cannot take the mental abuse from him amymore. \n\nAfter the incident I booked a hotel to stay and try to get property viewings and left the property. The kid stayed with him and he's threatening tomorrow to not take the kid in from nursery\n Which leaves me with no where to go with him.\n\n Before all this kicked off, he was letting me stay until I found a new place. I have previously sought  help from the council, they offered me hostel without internet (this is important as I wfh). At the time I've weighed my options since he was letting me stay and decided not take the emergency accommodation. \n\nHe's also in the service so he can stay on base, but he's refusing to do so. I asked him for this option so I can stay in the house with my son and we don't stay under the same roof. This man does everything in his power to see me struggling and he is succeeding so far, as I find myself crying all the time. He knows how to get to me. \n\nNow, since I can't refer back to the council and he's kicking me out with the kid, are there any organisations that can help me until I find a place to privatly rent?",

I have no idea what the warrant could be for, I haven\u2019t been pulled over or know of any court date I had. If anything came in the mail my family is unfortunately trashing it. Working on getting my California Drivers License so my address can be changed. What should my first step be to figure out what my warrant is for? Bail bondsman back home couldn\u2019t give me information.",

Or you can just call the police like SendLGaM suggests. I am not sure why you are afraid of being tracked if you do not know what you did to have a warranty on you?",

They can search the court records and see if there are any cases active that may be the source of the warrant. They can't directly search warrants in the police database, but can work with the DA to figure out what the issue is if they cannot find it.\n\nThe local police may not give out warrant information over the phone but it is unlikely that any special effort will be made to find you if you are on the opposite side of the country for a relatively minor offense.",

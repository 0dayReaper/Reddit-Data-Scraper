    "postText": "My coworker got fired due to some money issues. I work at a fast food restaurant. We\u2019re both supervisors and we handle money throughout the night. One night, they left money out (almost $150) and was fired a couple weeks after. \n\nSo,, they led a Union campaign at my location the year prior, they were very paranoid that they were going to get fired at any point. Them getting fired had nothing to do with their involvement in the Union. Due to policy, the company took that extra step because my coworker was already on a final warning. \n\nA couple weeks after they were fired, I had also almost gotten fired due to the same reason. My manager had to plead with my DM because I had no other write ups. And I was left with a final warning. \n\nAfter a couple months I get a call from the labor board. I was scared and answered anything they asked. I don\u2019t think I was ever given the option to refuse the questioning, and I don\u2019t know if I have proof of that because everything was on call. Then there was a zoom meeting about questioning for an affidavit, and they sent an email to me to review and sign the affidavit. I completely ghosted them after that. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of it, of course I care for my past coworker but I don\u2019t care enough about this job to go to this length. \n\nAnd then last week I received the subpoena. I called the lawyer I had spoken with and I was clear about not wanting to go to court nor sign the affidavit. They assumed I was scared because I still work for the company the case is against. I explained to them that I have really bad anxiety and won\u2019t be able to do anything like this. They told me that the subpoena was just to make me sign the affidavit. They said they would talk to their boss because in their words, \u201c We\u2019ve never had anybody who straight up doesn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d And give me a call later, it\u2019s been almost 24 hours and they haven\u2019t called me back.\n\nButtt,,,, when they spoke to my other supervisor coworker who ended up in the same trap as me, they said that their boss would have the judge order an officer to get them and bring them to court\u2026 to sign their affidavit\u2026 \n\nIs that using force? Is there a way out of this? \n\nI\u2019ve never physically signed anything. I\u2019m confused in the process of all of this. Don\u2019t I have the right to refuse to sign it? Or have I gone too deep already?",

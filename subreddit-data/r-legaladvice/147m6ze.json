    "postText": "Hello, I moved out of an apartment at the end of May. My landlord walked the space and sent me my deposit back, said everything looked great. \n\nHe is now requesting money for having to clean the carpets for an \u201codor.\u201d Can he legally do anything about it after already sending my deposit back? It\u2019s not a huge amount so ultimately I would pay it, but he is saying the odor is still there and I am worried about being charged more in the future.",

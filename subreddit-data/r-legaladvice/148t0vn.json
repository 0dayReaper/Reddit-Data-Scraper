    "postText": "So apparently I owed an old apartment complex 2k.\n\nIt was then sold to a debt collector who sued me.\n\nOn the sheet it says they mailed it the day after I moved across the country and I was supposed to go to court on the 20th of last month or have a default judgment.\n\nI just received the mail two days ago after enabling a forward address at usps.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best course of action. Two lawyers\u2019 letters are also in the mail about fighting creditors, but they\u2019re closed now.\n\nWould it be better to negotiate it down with the creditor than pay legal fees + whatever I owe on the debt? \n\n\nThis was in VA and the letter I received was a warrant of debt.",

    "postText": "I arranged catering for my wedding. A week before the caterer cancelled saying that a former employee had double booked the day without telling anyone and had pocketed the money. The caterer said they could no longer provide the food we had agreed to buy. \n\nI hadn\u2019t paid them yet and I am currently working to arrange another vendor but this may not be successful, tbd. \n\nI am mad and want to hold them accountable for this but wondering whether there is a case here worth pursuing. \n\nI have everything in writing. Total value of the catering was ~$1500. I am in California. \n\nAdvice?",

However, we have a contract and my wedding is coming up in a week.  Are you telling me that you're refusing to perform?  Because a new caterer at this late date will be expensive and I'm going to expect you to pay the difference.\"",

If it were my wedding I'd engage another caterer, get them to document the upcharge for short notice, than sue for breach of your original contract later, within the statute of limitations for written contracts in your state, of course.",

These things happen (being double booked/short staffed, not the stealing) but the caterer should absolutely be the one finding a way to make you whole. Most know plenty of other caterers in the industry who would probably love a referral... Id reach back out and see if there's anyone there who can help to at least find a caterer for you... Though that also shouldn't necessarily preclude any other monetary compensation/refund if you'd already paid a deposit...",

I don\u2019t wanna sound mean, as you are in a tight situation. It\u2019s horrible they canceled, but you might have to just eat the cost of having to book another caterer for the wedding.

No. These are additional funds on top of compensatory damages (which you don\u2019t have) where someone\u2019s actions have been gross, intentionally malicious, &amp; negligent (having an shitty employee isn\u2019t this). I understand it sucks but it will be more of a money suck to pursue this than it will be to make the best and move on. I\u2019m definitely not sticking up for the caterer but it\u2019s a no win situation.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t answer the potential increase in price. Short answer is no. Longer answer is caterer 1\u2019s price is x. Caterer 2\u2019s price is x+2. One costs less but is ultimately unavailable so it\u2019s not an option. It costs more but you\u2019re still not damaged.",

If the contract has a clause about not being able to fulfill the tasks paid for then follow the process and maybe pursue small claims , but keep in mind you may not gain much out of them. You may need to pay court and/or lawyer costs and it could equal more money than you would gain. I know you're livid which is absolutely fair; you've been put in a difficult position, but it might be best to write a review about what happened (make sure you point out they had a bad employee that put you in this position) and move on. \n\nAlso if you decide to sue make sure you have the price and contract of the new carter that way the courts know your not just picking a random amount you want to be compensated.",

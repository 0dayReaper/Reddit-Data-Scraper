Like the title says: My neighbor planted a huge tree in his front yard that has gotten so big, half of the tree hovers in my yard and the root of the tree has grown so long they hsve grown underground in my yard and underneath my house. So now my walkway on the side of my house to get to my back yard will not grow grass anymore because  there\u2019s big lumpy tree roots that I trip over constantly. I know it\u2019s legal in the state of NC for me to have the part of the tree that is on my property taken down but I don\u2019t know who would handle that. Any help?",

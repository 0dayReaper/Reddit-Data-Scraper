    "postText": "I work at a major retailer in northeast USA. I just trained someone for nearly 10 weeks for the same exact position as me in another store. I am a woman, and I am 23 years old.\n\nToday, I found out they are about to become salary at $59k. Let's call my trainee \"Ben\".\n\nMy base pay is $55k. I have worked in my store for two years, I am a district trainer and constantly help out in other stores, I consistently meet above expectation goals on my annual reviews and my store does almost double the business of the store Ben is going to.\n\nI make an extra $6.5k on top of my salary due to the work location. One of my associates recently tried to apply to a trainee position as well, but did not end up taking it because they offered him pay that did not take into account the differential he makes in our store. They said they do not take that into account when making job offers.\n\nThe last assistant I had, let's call him \"Nate\" was hired as my position at $57.5k. \n\nNotice that both of the examples I shared have MEN that have been hired after me training them, to go make a higher base salary than me in slower stores with less experience.\n\nDo I have a case here?\n\nEdit: Base pay is also important because our yearly bonuses are based on the base salary, not total salary.\n\nSecond edit: I am genuinely asking the question. I might come off as irritated, but I am just frustrated with my situation, not trying to seem entitled. I really appreciate all the responses. Thank you.",

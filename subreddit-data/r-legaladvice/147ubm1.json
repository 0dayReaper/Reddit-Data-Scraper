    "postText": "So I'm trying to figure out if I(26f)ave any grounds legally. My ex (33m) has been messaging me repeatedly trying to get me to come over and some seemed rather vulgar by asking to fu** me and things of that sort and the messages have become more frequent so I decided to block him rather than just ignore him anymore. After blocking him he then messaged my husband on Facebook telling him that I cheated on him with no proof because it never happened, but sent pictures he had of me that he Screenshot from when I was selling content but they were not pictures that I sold were ones that were posed on social media that I had deleted a while ago because I no longer felt the need to sell content. I unblocked him when my husband got the first message saying I cheated on him just to ask him \" wtf is wrong with you\" and he has proceeded to message me daily since, his last message lastnight saying he still wants me but felt he had no other move than to try and disruptmy marriage. I don't have any of the messages from before I blocked him so I only have the messages since Thursday that he has sent me and I feel like it's not enough proof for a restraining order. As well as last time I tried to file a restraining order on an ex which has been over 5 years now I was told I didn't have enough proof or grounds to stand on because it was messages and I didn't have proof that he was harassing me in person.",

    "postText": " We met on Tinder in December and started seeing each other in January. We've slept together a handful of times. I decided it would be best to stop seeing each other around the start of last month when they started telling people to stay away from each other.\n\nAt first he was really understanding but over the past couple weeks he's been pushing to see me more. I kept trying to make plans to see him once everything has calmed down but he's been insisting on coming over to my place despite everything. Yesterday I finally put my foot down and let him know we wouldn't be meeting now or later since I didn't like how pushy he was being.\n\nHe called me and we got into it because I wouldn't let him come over. Once we hung up, he snapped me a video of us HAVING SEX in his fucking car. I don't even know when he took it. It's dark so you can't really see me but it's clearly my voice. On the video he wrote that I would either let him come over or he'd send the video to my boss and tell his mom because HE'S 17. I told him I was out of town because my sister had her baby (which is true) but he could come over when I got back. I was afraid if I told him no straight up that he'd send the video.\n\nI DID NOT KNOW HE WAS 17. I NEVER would have slept with him. I have screenshots of his Tinder profile where his age is clearly listed as 19. I don't have a Facebook so we were never friends on there but I do have his Insta and SC and nothing on those indicates he's 17. I keep thinking back over all of our interactions but even in text messages he doesn't say anything to indicate he was in high school.  He told me he went to a local community college, he talks about college classes and getting off of his job at HEB. Anyway it's not like we had long conversations; our relationship consisted of having sex and maybe getting dinner beforehand.\n\nPlease help me. I've been freaking out about this for several hours. I work with kids right now and I'm in school to be a school social worker, I can't have this on my record. I know I should probably go to the cops but how can I do that and make sure nothing comes out of this???",

His mother should definitely be made aware but I don't know where he lives so I can't just go tell her myself (assuming he even lives with her). \n\nPlus, I'm afraid that if I don't say anything he'll email the video to my boss who will probably fire me because he's under 18 since I work with at-risk youth. I'm really worried about what he could do to my name and my career. Thanks so much for your help.",

    "postText": "I live in MA within a condo association that keeps threatening to tow my livery vehicle. I have a job for a transportation company and drive a 2016 Chrysler 300. Part of my conditions/benefits is that I get a company car. Back in February 2023 I was asked to remove any decals of company and given permission to park in the parking lot on that condition, which I fulfilled. Now 4 months later, I'm still getting threats to have my vehicle towed. One rule in the bylaws states that Commercial vehicles can not be parked in the parking lot. But I've looked at federal and MA definition of a commercial vehicle, and my sedan doesn't fall under either of those definitions.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I would love someone to let me know, maybe I'm missing something. But if I'm right, I would appreciate any and all advice on how to defend myself from this abuse and be able to actually use my own parking space. Thanks!",

    "postText": "So I had the HVAC company (let\u2019s say ABC Co) out today for a annual checkup.   Tech showed me leaking from the evaporator coil so needs replacing.  \n\nShowed me the ABC Co quote on his iPad.  3500.  Then he says \u201cI can do for half that\u201d.  \nSo like on his own he would come with new equipment (same new equipment with same mfg warranty he claims). He would then do install himself.  I would pay him directly.  Half price of going through company he works for and had ABC Co uniform and truck when at my house.  \n\nObviously he should not do this (corp opportunity, duty to employer..::nearly stealing really). \n\nBut as for me, the consumer who has been offered this out of the blue, can I get in trouble with ABC co?  Can they sue me for conspiring to steal or maybe interference with biz relations?  Like, I am just agreeing to accept an offer at a lesser price.  Obviously I know it\u2019s unethical for me to agree to do this, but is it legally risky if ABC co sues me?",

He claims he will register warranty so I get 10 year and that he would then do the warranty labor.  But not sure I can trust him (seems not since he is screwing his employer). \n\nHadn\u2019t thought about bond/insurance.",

When would you find out;  a couple of years down the road when you call his personal cell phone ?\n\n&gt;he would then do the warranty labor.\n\nHe's either not going to, or he's double-screwing his employer by registering your warranty as though they'd done the installation.   In general warranties for this sort of machinery are only valid if the installation was done by an authorized distributor / installer.\n\n&gt;interference with biz relations?\n\nAlmost certainly not, with this set of facts.  A maintenance contract probably doesn't prohibit you from discontinuing their services or choosing a competitor.",

            "comment": "Former HVAC contractor.  There\u2019s no legal trouble you can get into but if he burns the house down brazing the coil, injures himself on your property, or does other harm to you or himself he has no insurance and it\u2019s going to fall on you. \n\nIf the contractor is priced right the direct costs (labor, parts, etc) are 40-50% of the price this is before overhead (CSRs, trucks, tools, insurance, etc etc). Tech is going to use the contractors overhead (truck, tools, ECT) and steal materials and refrigerant. he\u2019ll probably buy the coil itself but if he weren\u2019t cutting corners or stealing materials he\u2019d be making about the same (although under the table and untaxed) as if he just did the work for the boss AND he is giving himself the headache of having to service you personally without a team to back him up.  So there is no way you are getting the same thing as if the company did it without being on the receiving end of a transaction involving stolen goods. \n\n\nReport this behavior to ABC co and then find another company that has ethical employees. \n\nRegarding of someone else could provide the labor part of the warranty mentioned above l. There is no labor warranty from a manufacturer (some will have policies that you can buy but they don\u2019t cover the contractors real costs). Warranty Labor always comes out of the pocket of the contractor (at least in part of there is a 3rd party extended warranty) This tech won\u2019t be around when you have an issue and it is when not if. He either has no intention of doing it or will be too busy between his job and his side work to do the free warranty.  He is unethical. If he\u2019ll steal clients from his employer what makes you think he won\u2019t steal from you.",

I likely would now move to a different company (shockingly the company he works for is one of largest in our area and this guy has been with them for years as he has been out in past to our house). \n\nBut my wife is more aggressive than me.  Got to figure out what to do.  Risks are not really with 1500 bucks and it also feels kinda sleazy to me.",

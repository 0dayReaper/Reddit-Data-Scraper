    "postText": "Last Thursday when I got my check deposited in my bank, I only got about 10% of my actually pay. Curious of course, I checked my paystub, and to my surprise they had counted my ADA as some sort of negative pay, which came out to about 90% of that weeks total pay. I am assuming they somehow accumulated all the ADA I have used and charged me for it for some reason. I messaged my manager and they sent an email to payroll and I have to wait on a response from them before I make any type of further action. I am now having to worry about my finances for the next 2 months because I am worried they will continue randomly charging for my ADA breaks, plus missing basically all of this pay (bi-weekly pay btw) has put me in a situation where I might need to rely on my savings to pay bills which is counter productive. If for some reason when they respond and do not pay me my full amount, is there any legal action I may take?  \n\n\nEdit 1: I want to make sure everything is clarified best I can since I am not the best with lawyer speak. So I will try to answer all the questions here so everyone can see them. I work 40 hours a week, and when I use my ADA, I only worked 32 hours, and that is how it is reflected on my paystub. They dont count it as 40 hours, and then deduct 8 hours later, they just pay me the 32 hours, so this has never happened before. If this was an adjustment, it was made in error. So basically instead of the 80 hours I was supposed to work, I worked 64. But they only paid me for like 8. I do need to use those breaks often due to the medical condition, so I tend to only work 72 or 64 hours every 2 week pay period, and my 10 minute breaks I use as needed so its off and on but they usually dont count those hours as worked hours anyway.",

If you do not work 40 hours a week, they do not have to pay you.\n\nThey don't have to show the math on your paystubs - it's okay for them to have \"32 hours\" instead of \"40 - 8 hours\".  \n\nThey do have to pay you for all the hours you worked.  If you've been overpaid in the past - if they paid you for hours you weren't at work - they *might* be able to deduct it from your pay.  It depends on what state you are in.",

    "postText": "So just looking to see whether or not it's time to get a lawyer involved. This is now the fourth week since my daughter when back to her mother(lives in another state) after spending time with me. I had enrolled her in a daycare center while I worked and was charged weekly. \n\nA week before she was to leave I informed the daycare center that this was her last week and to remove her from the class and end payment. \n\nThe first charge I assumed was for the week prior and so I didn't think anything of it. Then the second one happened the following week. I compared the amount of weeks my daughter had gone with my payments and discovered that it was actually 2 weeks of overcharges at this point. So I texted the director and told them about my issue. She said she would get with the person who does all the billing and get it fixed. \n\nFast forward the following week another charge came out. This resulted in my bank charging an overdraft fee as I had paid rent not thinking I would be charged again. I went to the daycare center in person and told the director to give me my money back. She said the finance director was on vacation last week and must not have gotten the message. So she messaged her again in front of me to get this fixed. \n\nNow here I am after the weekend and I'm now starting to fall behind on money because the almost $600 I should've had is not there and I'm facing another overdraft this week because of my bills. I did contact the bank and told them that I would call them if I got charged again to get it reversed. However I want to know if it's possible to have them payback what they owe me + the overdraft fees since they caused them?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your advice. After sending an email giving them a deadline as well as an itemized list of the charges, they responded by saying a refund will be going out today for all the charges. However they will not refund the overdraft fees, so I will discuss my options with the bank. \n\nAppreciate all the responses and ideas so I will be prepared for if this happens in the future.\n\nIt is also showing refund pending on the account page on the daycare website.",

Also, keep emailing the director daily so you have a written record of your requests. Give them a deadline to get the refund done.  It will help if you have to take them to small claims court.\n\nEdit - not a lawyer!",

If so, you have 60 days to dispute. Debit card? Then you have 120 days to dispute.

No low-level manager wants to be responsible for bringing legal into it, especially for places that pay outside lawyers. Those costs are perceived as very high. \n\nCase in point: I had a friend who was nearly screwed over on her moving costs (\\~$13,000), and the mere mention of legal counsel got them to agree to pay them.

Parents would tell me all the time about upcoming schedule changes, but I would have to remind them to update their parent account because I couldn\u2019t do anything about it on my end, and they would be charged based on what their account says. \n\nI was constantly emailing our billing department to make corrections, but they only had so many employees for a large amount of students, so sometimes there were weeks of playing catch up for them.\n\nJust something to keep in mind for the future if you sign your kid up for daycare again. Often times it\u2019s completely out of the hands of the people actually watching the kids, and stay on top of parent portals.",

If they are charging ones account as an ACH (first ask the bank to block the transactions, if they cannot)\u2026 then ask the bank to close the account and open a new one.  Then let them go back and claw back the money that was illegally withdrawn.  One does not need a lawyer for this so much as some patience and time to deal with the bank end to end.",

My company reimburses overdraft fees with the waive of a hand, without question, when we're at fault &amp; even when we're not at fault.  Make some noise.  Be more of an annoyance to them than it's worth to not reimburse you.  This was not your mistake, it was theirs &amp; it should not cost you financially.",

Again not sure about your bank but the one I work at would just have them listed as merchant error.",

The fine itself is not an issue but I am on a deferred disposition for a speeding ticket i got in \"city A\" in another county of Texas. The compliance date on the deferred disposition for speeding ticket in city A is by 06/14/2023 and I got the parking violation in city B today 06/12/2023. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically there is two days left in my deferral period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe language on the court order says:\n\n\"Not to commit any moving traffic violation, any violation of a 'city A' ordinance, any offence against the laws of the state of texas or the united states during deferral period\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this a violation of my terms on the court order for my deferred disposition? I am on the phone with the court of city A but there is a very long wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish parking spots didnt indicate parking is allowed when there is a fire hydrant within the sign board's range . I got out of my car on the opposite side of the curb and didnt even see the fire hydrant. paid the parking fee too thought id be good.",

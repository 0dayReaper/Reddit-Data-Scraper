    "postText": "I work private retail, but a national multimillion dollar company. For years, corporate was ok with Sat/Sun shifters who typically run the store alone closing for a half hour for a break since our shift runs 745a-630p. They've recently decided against this and are trying to convince workers to skip our one measly unpaid half hour in favor of trying to eat or sit between customers/running a store alone. They paint it as two paid 15 min breaks but it's not a break if I have to constantly stop what I'm doing to assist customers. Hell, they even want us to take the store phone into the restroom with us as to not miss a call. Trust me, what I'm selling isn't that important. I know everything is at-will, but do I have any rights to my break?",

            "comment": "New Hampshire law requires employers to allow a 30-minute meal break after an employee has worked five consecutive hours, unless the employer allows the employee to eat while working and it is feasible for the employee to do so. If the employee eats while working, the employee must be paid for that time. If the employee gets an actual break, the time may be unpaid.",

    "postText": "Looking for tips/info on property agreements. To keep it short, my fianc\u00e9 and I are going to be purchasing a home together. He makes considerably more than I do, and has a lot of assets. I have good income, but am much younger so have minimal liquidity. So, he will be putting a large cash payment down, and then we will be (roughly) splitting the mortgage thereafter.  We do plan to eventually get married and will have this document as part of the prenup. I have no idea what\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d to protect him but also not put myself in an unfair situation because this is something I fully support. \n\nIdeally, we would like to structure an agreement so that (in a worst case scenario) if something was to happen with our relationship that he would be protecting his initial investment of the down payment while also fairly sharing our portions of equity in the house. \n\nHas anyone experienced this or could give any advice on best method of breaking this down? Do we need to keep a spreadsheet of every dollar paid into the house? Do we need to lay out the percentages at the start? Does the initial down payment equity need to be broken out at the beginning with a different growth rate and then keep track of who paid what into mortgage?\n\nHome purchase is in Florida if that makes any difference.",

You should definitely have a lawyer help you draw up a contract.\n\nSome things to consider, and address in the contract:\n\n* Who owns what percentage of the house?  (Related note: when you buy the house, make sure it is deeded correctly, and you're on the deed.)\n* How are you going to pay the mortgage? 50/50, or will one of you pay more?\n* How are you going to pay other expenses of home ownership? Think about utilities, insurance, upkeep, repairs, property taxes, etc.  Will this also be 50/50 or some other arrangement?\n* When you sell the house, how will the proceeds be split up?  Based on percentage of ownership? Do people get reimbursed for things, and then split the remainder? Think through how that will work.\n* What happens if you break up or one of you just no longer wants to live together? Do you have the right to force a sale of the house?  It would probably be bad to get stuck co-owning a house with someone you no longer get along with.",

I know I\u2019m definitely overlooking a lot of things that need to be addressed. We will definitely seek actual legal counsel once we are ready to proceed, we\u2019re just trying to kind of get on the same page before we have someone actually draft an agreement.",

He was previously in a 15+ year relationship (unmarried) and it ended very ugly, with a horrible battle over the house. I do completely understand we want to avoid any mess in the worst case scenario (and without emotions/anger), but I\u2019m much younger so I\u2019ve never owned a home and I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing any major pieces to this.",

In addition to getting a lawyer involved in writing a purchase agreement it\u2019s worth getting some legal advice on other aspects of partnership typically covered by marriage, such as: healthcare POAs, wills, living wills, etc. There\u2019s a vast set of things that spouses are entitled to do for each other that aren\u2019t automatically available to non-married partners. I\u2019m a member of the lgbtqia+ community and there\u2019s an entire specialty of law among queer lawyers devoted to ensuring that partners can act in each other\u2019s best interests if something bad happens.  A lot of the same issues are in play for a non married straight couple. \n\nI know it\u2019s scary to consider, but look at this as an opportunity to develop a working relationship with a lawyer - as a younger person you\u2019re going to have many opportunities to seek out legal advice over the years, and it\u2019s worth having someone you trust you can call on.",

I pushed for that since we already lived together and i was worried if something happened during lockdown I wouldn\u2019t be allowed in a hospital as \u201cfamily\u201d. Added bonus, he was able to get on my insurance since he\u2019s self employed and was paying out the ass for a private plan. So, we have already outlined most of the changes for the will and POA stuff because he already had one in place (he\u2019s in his late 40s and I\u2019m in my late 20s). Basically, once we buy the house, we\u2019ll plan to be married within 3-6 months after that (which is why I say we\u2019ll basically just roll this document into the prenup when the time comes)",

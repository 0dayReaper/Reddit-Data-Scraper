    "postText": "I live in California. I broke up with my ex a year ago. I made it abundantly clear that I never want to hear from him again. For a few months after, he stalked me (changed his number and email address to contact me, sent me a package in the mail, and came around to the apartment complex). Then he went silent until about 3 weeks ago. He found my new address online and drove up to the property to deliver a letter. It's so random and I'm not sure what triggered this. \n\nHe has a history of stalking behaviors. He broke into my house when we broke up in 2021. In 2020, he drove up to my home uninvited, stayed outside, and begged me to come out. I know, it wasn't the best relationship, but I really pitied him. \n\nI want to get a restraining order. I didn't save a lot of the texts/emails/mail from last year because I wasn't considering a restraining order back then... But I have this letter now. He wrote that he looked up my new address online and hand-delivered it to the property. Is that incriminating enough? I'm wondering if I have enough evidence for this. \n\nOr is there a better way to go about this? I just want him to leave me alone.",

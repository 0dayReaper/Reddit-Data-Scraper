    "postText": "My son ( 20 years old ) was in a accident yesterday where the other driver was at fault. A police report was filed indicating the other driver was the cause of the accident.  \n\nInformation - my son was not insured and received a ticket . ( Yes I already called him a dumbass ) \n\nHis car was totaled and towed to wrecking yard.  \n\nHe still owed money on his car. \n\nSuffered a leg injury and bruising from airbags . \n\nWe are dealing with Geico from the other driver and are looking for recommendations. I know it was not responsible for my son to be driving without insurance but he will pay for that legally. \n\nRight now Geico is already trying to ask for tons of information and pass cost to us.  \n\nShould we get a lawyer right away or try and keep dealing with Geico ? \n\nHe lives in the state of Oregon and the law clearly says at fault driver is responsible.",

At that point you would look for legal representation. If you get a lawyer earlier, it can delay the process substantially. Wait to see if they are willing to offer you a fair amount. \n\nYou might also be able to find three+ matching vehicles in your region, give those listings to them, and say that is what fair market value is. Sometimes you can get them to bump it up. It\u2019s totally normal for an insurance company to try to minimize the amount they pay out initially.",

Insurance companies have a reputation of trying to pay as little as possible.  His biggest worry is him himself not having car insurance . ( Yes I chewed his ass out but he's a adult now out of the house ) . \n\nSo I'm just looking for advice about dealing with Geico vs reaching out to one of those expensive lawyer types .",

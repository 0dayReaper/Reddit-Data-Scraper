    "postText": "i was a victim of a violent sex crime. i reported it and pressed charges and decided to start an investigation. that investigation, for the most part, starts with my interview with the detective assigned to my case. problem is the detective rarely communicates with me. \n\n3 weeks after i reported she called me but i didn\u2019t answer and so i left a message. she called me back 3 weeks later to set up our interview, but on the day of, she canceled and didn\u2019t reschedule. i texted her multiple times to find a time to reschedule but she again didn\u2019t respond for 3 weeks. she texted last week and asked me to give her a day and time to meet but she again didn\u2019t respond. it\u2019s been about 3 months since reporting and i feel like nothing has happened. i also feel responsible for this to go quickly as the perpetrator is a serial predator and i worry about his next victims. \n\nis there a way to make the detective take my case more seriously and speed up the investigation? should i talk to her supervisor or talk to an attorney? or is this just what i should expect from a criminal investigation?",

Many jurisdictions have a victim's advocate who coordinates with you.  Many detectives treat victims as a source of what they need and the victim's advocate tries to make up for that.",

    "postText": "My wife and I recently moved in to a new apartment and have discovered that the garbage disposal is not working. We didn't find this out till about a week after moving in due to our busy schedule and moving from our old apartment. We submitted a maintenance request as soon as we discovered the issue but have not heard back. We've gone up to the front desk of our complex and confirmed that they received the request but have not heard anything back since then. We cant afford to eat out for every meal and the sink is starting to smell awful. Its very difficult to wash any dishes we do use and it just gets worse by the day.\n\nThis is in Utah and i've been reading about \"repair and deduct\", to get this issue resolved sooner rather than later. We left a voicemail over the weekend stating that if we did not hear back we would find someone to repair the sink ourselves and deduct the cost from our rent. I'm just unsure if this falls under repair and deduct and want to be sure there wont be any issues down the line as we want to keep a good relationship with management.\n\nBesides this one issue the area is great and has been a huge improvement to my families life, we just cant wait any longer for this to be resolved.  \n\n\nEdit: Repair and Reduct falls under the Utah Fit Premises Act",

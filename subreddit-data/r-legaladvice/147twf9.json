    "postText": "*Apologies if this is in the wrong sub*\n\nWriting on behalf of a 64 f uk. \n\nI have just lost my care job of 6 years. I\u2019ve always been a diligent and conscientious care worker and I take my job very seriously. \n\nWhen applying for the job - in both the interview and the application - I stated that I am immune I promised after having leukaemia and having my spleen removed as a result. I was surprised that they still gave me the job but very pleased to be working. \n\n2 months ago, I contracted a serious lung infection (along with two other co-workers) from an agency worker who refused to wear a mask despite me suggesting she should several times because she was coughing and sneezing everywhere. \n\nI was off for a week and due to being immunocompromised I was very Ill and put on steroids. The infection had spread to my eyes and when I felt better, I consulted a dr and an optician who both agreed that i would be able to go back to work, I just won\u2019t be able to come into \u201ctoo\u201d close contact with vulnerable people. I communicated this with my manager and explained that I wouldn\u2019t be able to perform certain tasks. \n\nOn the day I returned to work, the manager said within the same breath \u201cI\u2019ve just filled out your return to work letter.. and also there have been some accusations against you but we can\u2019t disclose them yet\u201d \n\nThis is an interim manager who had been managing the unit for just over a month. \n\nAfter a week, they disclosed the allegations which were completely false - suggesting that I had upset a resident. The context was missing and the situation had been twisted around. \n\nThe following week, they suspended me and during my disciplinary hearing - they explained that there was a new set of allegations against me. Again, fabricated lies and completely twisting truths. Suggesting that I had refused to assist people with toileting. However, they are referring to when the eye infection was preventing me from providing such up-close personal care. \n\nDespite explaining all of this, they have fired me stating gross misconduct.\n\nDo you think I would have any chance standing up against this in an employment tribunal? They are a big, well known care company. \n\nI am one of the oldest and physically weak members of the team, however I\u2019m an incredibly caring, thoughtful and empathetic carer who would never dream of exposing anyone to any forms of abuse, neglect or jeopardy to their dignity. I have never had a single complaint made against me or my work until now and it\u2019s so heartbreaking to leave on these terms. \n\nI feel like I have been set up.\n\nI don\u2019t care about getting any money or anything, I just don\u2019t want gross misconduct on my work history/to not get a reference. \n\nThank you",

    "postText": "I rented a room in someone's house while working a travel job in Wisconsin. I paid a security deposit equal to one month's rent. We had a verbal agreement regarding the rental and that the deposit was refundable if I didn't cause damage to the home. I terminated my stay a month early. In the middle of April, I let her know I would not be returning for May because my job had extended and I needed a place I could stay through the summer, which she was not able to accommodate. She is now refusing to return my deposit and will not respond to communication. Given there was no written lease, is it worth it to pursue this in small claims court?",

            "comment": "[She has 21 days following the end of the rental agreement to return your deposit](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/704/28). This means the 21 days begins on whatever day your tenancy was supposed to end. You should be sure to give her your forwarding address in writing and keep proof. You can achieve this by promptly sending her certified mail, the letter should recap your departure and the amount of your security deposit. You should keep a copy of the letter and the receipt. She\u2019s probably entitled to keep your deposit, but if she fails to account for it in the manner required by law, you can still sue for its return. [You might recover twice the amount wrongfully withheld](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/100/20/5).",

    "postText": "Me and my girlfriend rushed into moving in together, after 2 weeks of living together we realized it wasn't going to work. She agreed to move out by end of February. Then COVID happened, and now she refuses to leave.\n\nI have 1 bedroom in my apartment, and i am tired of sleeping on my couch. Lately she has started denying me entry into my own unit. She uses the deadbolt on the inside and pretends to not hear me. Last night when i came home around 11 pm, i discovered i couldn't get into my apartment as she had dead bolted it.\n\nAfter pounding/calling after an hour She started screaming at me to go away. I ended up calling the police who after talking to her briefly he told me to go find somewhere else to stay for the night and said i needed to leave. I slept all of last night in my car.\n\nThis morning, after she left for work i removed the deadbolt from my door. I also discovered a complete and utter stranger sleeping in my living room, along with another girl passed out in my bed.\n\nAfter i kicked them out, my ex came home and told me i have no rights to kick out her guests. She called the police and the officer said it was a civil issue (by this time her guests had already left).\n\nTonight i have a late shift again, and i guarantee you the same thing is going to happen. What am i supposed to do? What kind of lawyer do i need?\n\nCan someone please help me? I live in Toronto, Ontario.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* Condo is owned 100% by me, she has never paid anything here.\n\n\\*EDIT 2\\* To clarify my location is Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\\*EDIT 3\\* Contacted LTB who told me she is not considered a tenant, and thus they are unable to assist me with this issue.",

Congrats, you *may* have just won the eviction lottery, gather your proof of residency, you'll need it now.\n\nhttps://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/do-tenants-have-rights-if-they-only-rent-a-room/\n\n&gt; For example, in most provinces, such as Ontario, Alberta and New Brunswick, tenants who rent a single or shared room have the same rights as most other residential tenants. However, if they share a kitchen or a bathroom with the ***owner*** (ding ding ding) or the owner\u2019s immediate family members, *they are* ***excluded from the Residential Tenancies Act*** *and special rules apply.*\n\nAnd.. Ready for this?\n\n&gt; In most cases, a tenant who shares a kitchen or bathroom with the ***owner*** (ding ding ding) or the owner\u2019s family does not have a legal right to remain living on the premises without the owner\u2019s consent, and can usually be evicted at any time ***without notice***.\n\nCheck the COVID19 restrictions, but law is on your side here, if everything is truly just in your name, and you are now effectively \"renting a room\" to this \"tenant\". She became a tenant when you broke up (technically before too I guess?). And you **are** the owner here, you win.\n\nnot a lawyer, just somewhat familiar with Ontario tenancy. \nExplore this deeper with a professional.",

However, if OP and his ex signed an agreement, failing to honour that agreement will open OP up to a lawsuit in small claims court.

I believe he can speak to the board too, but with CoVID fucking everything up it makes the blurred lines even worse. She did damage his property, deadbolts and all.

That said, yes, there could be a tort claim on the chattels, but that\u2019s still civil, not criminal. I do think there\u2019s is an interference with his property rights, just this rule is not on point (and honestly, I\u2019m wandering this thread while I eat lunch while WFH, so not really motivated to research Canadian property laws beyond what I did, confirming that they view chattels the same as the US).\n\nBlocking the driveway, maybe a real property claim, but if you can physically get into the property, I doubt it\u2019d hold much water and getting cops to help with the way things are right now wouldn\u2019t likely help. Cellphone jamming is a whole different ball of wax that is way out of my basic legal knowledge (i.e., telecomm stuff, cybersecurity, etc).\n\nETA - also, the fact that she was at least originally invited to be there (i.e., move in) would make some of the claims hard to prove until he actively tries to get her out. Frankly, he needs a local lawyer, stat. There may even be some sort of legal aid there for landlord/tenant (though those groups are usually all about tenants\u2019 rights, because it\u2019s *usually* (def. not always) the tenants who are getting hosed).",

Even in /u/Hindsight_DJ 's comment it says \"in most cases\" and I doubt either of us know what those exceptions are. This is going to be specific enough that you definitely need a lawyer to navigate this because even if you're technically right that she's not a tenant and can be evicted with no notice and even if the pandemic doesn't change that situation the odds that whatever random patrol officer who responds to her call that \"my landlord illegally evicted me\" is going to understand that and not force you to let her back in are approximately 0.0000%.",

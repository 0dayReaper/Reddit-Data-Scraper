    "postText": "Hello Reddit family.  \n\nHope someone here can tell me if this is possible.  \n\nIs it possible to transfer the property I gained in a will to another sibling?\n\n\nMy father died in March. I have a older brother and younger sister.  However, I am the most responsible amongst my siblings.  I mention this facet because before my dad died, I organized his will with the help of a lawyer per his request.  In this will, he placed me as the person whom is responsible for his property and split all financial responsibilities between my sister and me.  \n\nI no longer live in my home state and have no intention of returning.  Long story short, death brings out some mischievous action in people.  There is sibling drama that I choose to disassociate with.  Spiritually, I want to be free from the negativity. \n\nIs it possible to differ my responsibilities of property to my sister? If so, how or what would be your recommendations?  If not, what else would you suggest for me to get out of this situation that I don\u2019t want to be a\nPart of?",

You will most likely need to sign documents removing you from the estate.  If you also do not wish to be a beneficiary of the estate, you will need to state that as well.",

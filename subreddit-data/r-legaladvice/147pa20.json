    "postText": "So my buddy is a inmate at a federal prison camp. He was walking down the hall with another inmate. They both had just gotten sodas from a different inmate. As they walked from one side of the camp to the other they had to cross right in front of the bubble (guard office) . As they got with in 10 feet of the bubble, 1 of the correctional officers walked out. Right as they passed him the Correctional officer called him over and told him to turn around and put his arms out. He was going to conduct a pat down search that was completely unprovoked. Before he started the pat down the officer said \"do you have anything on you\" the inmate said \"no\" the officer said \"are you sure\" the inmate said \"yes\" then the officer started with the waist band then the out side of the right leg, then the officer took his hand and ran it up the inside of the inmates leg all the way into his crotch firmly pressing his hand into the inmates taint/crotch the officer held his hand there for a second or 2 then proceeded to shake/vibrate his hand back and forth against the inmates crotch and as he was doing this motion he made a buzzing noise with his mouth. Then he continued with running his hand down the inside of the other leg, laughing as he did it. He conducted the rest of the pat down and didnt find anything in the process. There was multiple witnesses of this happening. But only 2 confirmed after the event took place. Only 1 witnesses is willing to make a statement, as the other witness doesn't wanna get involved and fears retaliation from the correctional officer involved. The correctional officer that preformed this pat down has had multiple prea violations reported against him at the medium security prison next to the camp. It is my understanding that he was not following correct protocol when it comes to strip searching. There is supposed to be 2 correctional officers presebt for a strip search and he would do them alone. The same officer can not work at the medium security prison anymore due to threats against his life by inmates that he treated very bad and harrased. This officer is not right in the head and enjoys doing terrible things to inmates for no reason. For example if you don't stand at the very end of your bed when it's count time, instead your just to the left or right of the end of your bed by a foot or 2, he will not only yell and degrade you in front of everyone, he will come back after count and destroy your stuff and probably your bunkies stuff too. Or he may just destroy the whole unit. And he likely to continue to do it for, anywhere from a few days for a few months. My buddy, the inmate is hesitating to file the report because he fears retaliation from the offending correctional officer. He does not wanna cause a problem for himself, his friend(witness) or his whole unit(40 inmates) is what described above, grounds for a prea violation and will the correctional officer be removed from the camp? Revenge/ retaliation is the main concern. It would be nice to have more than 1 witness, or security footage of the pat down happening. I would like to pick the brain of someone that's has knowledgeable with PREA and its standards. If the actions of the officer is not enough or lacks enough evidence to result in disciplinary actions then it may not be worth pursuing. Because retaliation would be guaranteed.",

PREA is usually taken pretty seriously and health staff at meat facilities see things differently than corrections. In federal facilities,  some health staff are also corrections officers, but not all.\n\nOf course, there's no way to fully avoid retaliation.  Even if the officer is reassigned, his buddies will still be there.",

No other officers act like him or treat inmates like him. Also my buddy was reffered to the nurse or his counselor to file a report but he is going to talk with an inmate today that used to be a lawyer and has help multiple other inmates with similar situations. Apperently He knows how to write the reports up and where to send them to achieve maximum impact. In doing research I have found out about these third party reporting agencies who will file a report on health of am inmate and keep them anonymous.  Idk how effective these third party agencies are but I'm still doing some research. The counselors, case manager,  nurse, dentist ect ect at this federal prison camp are notoriously lazy and do not do their job. So I'm not sure how effective reporting to any of them may be. Maybe get a report wrote up and send it to the warden and the camp administrator.",

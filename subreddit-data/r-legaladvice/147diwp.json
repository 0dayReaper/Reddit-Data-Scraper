    "postText": "Hi everyone, back in January 2023, I received a letter from a collection agency stating I owed $236 in court fees/fines for an incident that took place in January of 2021. At first, I thought it was a scam or something, but after checking on the official database for the circut court in question, I found this was a legitimate letter.\n\nAllegedly, I was issued a speeding ticket in Portland, Oregon, in January 2021. And the court fines/fees for due to me failing to appear in court in regards to that ticket. The funny thing is, I was not living anywhere near that area at the time or owned the vehicle in question. Previously, I used to live in Southern Washington, about 40 min from Portland, but in 2018, my wife and I moved to Arizona for school. Looking at the report, the vehicle in question was a vehicle I had sold in May of 2018, and I had the vehicle taken out of my name in WA within 30 minutes of selling it. \n\nI called the collection agency and provided them with proof that I wasn't the owner of the vehicle and wasn't living in the area at that time. I was told that I would have to reach out to the court. I did, and the clerk had me submit a \"Motion for Relief from Default Judgment\" with proof. I did and waited the 90 days to hear back. I just received the letter today, and the motion was denied because it was past the deadline for me to submit a motion of releif. Looking up the law provided on the letter, I found that I had one year from the judgment date to submit that motion. The problem was that I was notified 2 years after the judgment date that I even had this judgment against me. I am not about to pay fines for an infraction i didn't commit, and I am going to call the court again tomorrow. I hope they can get this sorted, but in the event they end up being useless, what can/should I do? Any help is appreciated.\n\n[Edit] \nGrammar/punctuation\n\n[UPDATE]\nFound a copy of the Record of Sale Receipt on the Washington DOL website. I called the court, and I now have to write a letter to a judge explaining everything and providing all the proof I have. I'm going to mail the stuff out tomorrow. Hopefully, this clears it up.",

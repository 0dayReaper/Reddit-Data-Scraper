    "postText": "I\u2019ve got a messy situation with my ex hiding income. I\u2019m going to try my best to keep this all organized while I unpack it. \n\n1. My ex (never married) moved and withheld our children from me and all of both of our families for a year. In that time she applied and was approved for CALWorks. I was finally able to track them down and opened a custody case. Which triggered a support case from the state. She ended up not coming to court at all and there was a default judgment to make my proposed order (50/50) permanent. She is named as the custodial parent and I\u2019m paying support to the state to reimburse for her cash aid. \n\n2. I recently found out from my ex\u2019s family member that she is doing gig work. Instacart, Uber eats, and door dash. \n\n3. My ex\u2019s live in boyfriend has a unisex name. The family member heavily implied that she is delivering under the bfs name. \n\nMy questions: \n\nIs there anything that I can do to prove any of this? \n\nShouldn\u2019t she be reporting income earned? \n\nIf she is using her bfs name, is there anything I can do about it? \n\nIf I do somehow magically prove all of this in court, will my child support be adjusted?",

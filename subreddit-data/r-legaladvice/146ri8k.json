    "postText": "I have been divorced for a couple years and my question is two fold. \n\nIn our divorce decree it states that he would refinance the house and pay off our debts. He did not do that, instead in 2020 he said \"we should file last years taxes together and that way we will get a bigger refund and split it\" and being a moron I agreed. He took the stimulus payment for our children and used it to pay part of the debt because \"I owed him\". Fine whatever at least it is done. He had one or two that had payments arranged for it to be paid off monthly. Again, okay as long as it is getting done. He sold the house and bought a bigger more expensive house using the money from house A to pay the down payment on house B.\n\nHe has been late...and defaulted on one card that I had no idea about. My credit it wrecked. I forwarded an email from one of the cards, he responded \"Yeah not paying those anymore as it doesn't impact my credit, deal with your own debts\". Is there anyway to get this reporting off my credit? Even if I took over payments now so much damage has been done. The debt is in my name, but was created while married, is this something that he still has to deal with since it was in the agreement or am I just going to have to deal?\n\nThe second part to this, he took me to court last year, it was dismissed...since dismissal he hasn't been paying full child support. I do not have it go through the court system because I thought I was trying to be as civil as possible. However, at this point, things are expensive, repairing my credit seems impossible and frankly I want our kids to have more than just their needs met. They have things they want to do. Would it be egregious of me to go through the court system and ask for the full agreed upon child support amount?\n\nIf it matters, I have solid employment in a salaried position and make above median. \n\nI have no idea how to proceed or what my options truly are.\n\nEdit: Thanks for everyone taking the time and emotional space to reply. It is probably a fair assestment that I needed someone outside of this to say \"no the agreement is what you stick to\".  I will call the lawyer tomorrow.",

It\u2019s still contractual but it also has force of court order as well.\n\nThe distinction is important because reneging on an MDA can\u2019t be done even before court order because it\u2019s contextual. Parenting time agreements are NOT contractual and it\u2019s possible to renege on a parenting time agreement before the final decree is issued. Reason being it that can\u2019t be contractual due to the subject matter. \n\nYou\u2019re correct, I\u2019m just providing a bit more context.\n\nStates may vary but likely not much, I\u2019m specifically speaking of Tennessee law.",

If any of this was court-ordered then you can and should get it enforced. It could go as far as being held in contempt, depending. Get his wages garnished. I don't imagine any of the verbal agreements you've made with him about money will supersede a court order, but you need a lawyer immediately to handle this. \n\nFinal piece of advice: don't get in the lawyer's way or try to hold them back. Let them go after every red cent you're owed and then some, even if you feel like a jerk for doing so. You do not owe niceness to your ex. All he's done is take advantage of it.",

I felt anything I did to make that harder (like enforcing a schedule, child support, etc) would just make his dad drop out. Well, he dropped out anyway!! My son and I at one point were living in a trailer park while dad and his girlfriend were renting a nice apartment by the beach. Anyway, go to court. Tell them how much was agreed upon and how much is owed. They may award you back support if you can prove that this was a contractual agreement between you two, or they may say it\u2019s unenforceable. \n\nThe benefit to having the court involved is that even if he doesn\u2019t pay, that debt is racking up with interest. His tax returns will be sent to you. He won\u2019t be able to leave the country while he is in your debt. \n\nRight now, my ex owes me $85k in back child support and it grows every month he doesn\u2019t pay, with 10% interest. He\u2019ll be paying me $1k/month for the next 10 years or so, and my kid turns 18 in less than a year. \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about the cc debt so I\u2019ll stay away from that. But I can say in my experience navigating the child support system is seamless and you don\u2019t need a lawyer.",

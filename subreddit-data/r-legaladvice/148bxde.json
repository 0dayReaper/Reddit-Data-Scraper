    "postText": "I am just wondering if anyone has any advice or thoughts on our situation.\n\nMy son in April had major surgery, and was recovering fine from it. We have had weekly appointments to check incisions and recovery. Doctors gave the okay for him to go back to school, and so he gradually transitioned back.\nThe school was given instructions about being careful with him, no twisting or turning, watching over him just more. We were still going to weekly check ups, he was being watch over very carefully.\n\nHe is nonverbal and has cerebral palsy, is fully wheelchair bound. They require two people to do any transfers.\nWe received a phone call and email stating that his chair had tipped over, on his right side where the incision was at. There was no signs of any injuries at that point in time.\nThey said to me on the phone and later in a email that there was a substitute teacher outside with him and another student in a wheelchair plus a para. \n\nThey said the rule is one person pushes one wheelchair, while the sub decided to push both wheelchairs at the same time my sons slipped off the sidewalk and tipped over.\n\nNow we have come to a point where his incision opened and he is needing more surgery to correct it. Doctors have stated it\u2019s very possible the fall caused this to happen.\n\nDoes the school have any accountability in this? Is this something we should be looking into more? They told me they would be contacting me further about it but I never received any calls. \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple weeks now, because we have been dealing with the health concerns and of course my mind has been fully on him.",

            "comment": "Yes, they are responsible. If the injuries and subsequent treatment are directly related to the wheelchair tipping over there needs to be a claim filed with their insurance. I would suggest contacting a local attorney to navigate the enormous amount of red tape thats going to come with this incident. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this on top of everything else.",

We had just found out yesterday that he will have to have surgery again, and they already scheduled it for Friday.",

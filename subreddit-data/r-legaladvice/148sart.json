    "postText": "I\u2019m in the market for a new car and the strength of the advanced driver assist (ADAS)features is a main selling point for me. Many cars in the $60-100k range come with features that allow for semi autonomous hands free driving in certain scenarios (ford blue cruise, gm super cruise, Tesla autopilot). \n\nComma 3  enhances the cars standard ADAS features through the use of openpilot, an open source level 2 autonomous driving software. The unit has been on sale for years and the system has logged tens of millions of miles. You can find out more at https://www.comma.ai\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at newer Toyotas that offer their safety sense system, but I\u2019d prefer to spend less on an older vehicle that is compatible with comma and offer better level two driving than the stock system. \n\nThe big issue is that I have no idea if they are legal or not and there is an extreme lack of information online. The product has been well covered by media sources, but they never mention the legality. \n\nI called my insurance company and described the comma and they said that they would cover it and the use of it while driving. I\u2019d like to get that in writing before proceeding. \n\nIf it is legal, buying the less expensive car is a no brainer. My main concern is that I\u2019m going to get in a wreck, my insurance won\u2019t cover it (even though they said they would) and I\u2019ll be charged with wreckless endangerment or worse once it is discovered that I\u2019m using a third party product to control my ADAS system.  That being said, this is a thing many, many people are using and I also know that there are laws that prevent insurance from denying you solely for aftermarket modifications. \n\nAny thoughts, direction or insight will be appreciated!",

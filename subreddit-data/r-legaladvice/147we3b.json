    "postText": "We have a rental property in Ohio. We, as landlord, would pay for HOA fees. The property management stop emailing us the bill, and sent the bill to the rental property, but our tenant did not notify us.\nWe did not get the bill and fail to pay on time. \nThe property management on the other hand had not tried to contact us in other ways, but only send the bill to the rental address.\nThe late fee and other fees(excluding the HOA fees) had been accumulated to over $2000, but we have not received the bill in any ways. They even put our property on foreclosure before notifying us, and we were told by our home insurance company about the outstanding case. Should the HOA share some of the responsibilities due to fail to notice? They should have our phone number or email, we had past email communications. If they at least send us an email, we would definitely pay the bill on time. \nI believe I send them the update address, but I am unable to prove that.\n\nedit\uff1aI was reviewing my email boxes. It looks like they send an email reminder in 2021 and we paid on time. But they stop sending out emails and we forgot about that too. I mean they have our emails and they could have easily informed us and we would love to pay the bill! But they did not inform us and have the late bills added on top of each other.\n\nEdit 2: they(both property management and their lawyer) did not contact us before they put our property on foreclosure! We received no letter, no email, no calls from either of them. We learned we have a pending case from our mortgage loan officer.",

They notified you in writing at the address subject to the HOA. Presumably that is what the HOA by-laws require of them.\n\nYou knew you owed the money. Not sure why you didn't just pick up the phone or send an email and get it handled. It sounds like you were hoping they just forgot about you.",

Our credit score is outstanding (over 800) and we were never late on the bills we received.

You are responsible for paying your bills even if your mail is stolen.\n\n&gt;I wish they did remembered us.\n\nThey did. They sent you a bill. Every month for months.  By postal mail to the address of the home subject to the HOA. And when you didn't pay the bills for months and months, they proceeded with what the law and HOA rules allow.",

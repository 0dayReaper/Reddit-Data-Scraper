    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m renting in Kentucky, and after a shift to new management, we\u2019ve been having a LOT of issues on our new lease.\n\nImmediately after purchasing our neighborhood, they eliminated trash service, so we all had to start taking it to the front office. Fine.\n\nIn the spring, they notified us all that they were no longer mowing our lawns, and that they would be charging if they had to when lawns get overgrown. \u2026Fine. That\u2019s in the lease.\n\nThey also increased everyone\u2019s rent without actually notifying us, we all just found that our rent was higher in our new leases than before.\n\nFine.\n\nBut this month, I realized that our rent was WAY higher than it should be. Like $2-300 too much. After looking at the last few months of bills, they have charged us an additional $227.45, but they haven\u2019t actually listed /what it\u2019s for/.\n\nFor now, we\u2019re refusing to pay the full amount due until they show us an itemized bill. Are we in the right for this? Surely we have a right to know what they\u2019re charging us for, right?",

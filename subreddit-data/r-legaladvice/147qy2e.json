    "postText": "I'm trying to file a straight forward QRDO myself to the King County court in Washington state.  The document itself is generated by Fidelity's software and very straight forward.  However, it's unclear how/if I can efile this myself with the court.  I tried filing by adding to an existing case as a Sealed Financial Source document.  It came back with the message \"This document you filed is a proposed/unsigned order. These types of documents should not be filed with the Clerk. Orders will be filed with the Clerk once they are signed by the judicial officer. You can review Local Court Rule (LCR) 7(b)(5)(C), for additional information.\"\n\nI've looked at this process but it's unclear what I need to filed for a proposed order.  Is this something I should be able to do myself?  I'm currently unemployed and trying to get this done without significant costs.",

    "postText": "Hello to all, including IMNAL. My mother (63) got assaulted at work (hospital) 2 days ago. \nShe sustained severe injuries, i.e. broken hand, torn ligaments on hand and contusion. Now I think she is developing PTSD. The company is aware and WC was already started. \nMy question is: who will pay for her first 5 days out of the job? MA laws aren't exactly explicit, like anywhere. \nPlease let me know.",

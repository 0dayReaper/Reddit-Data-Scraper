    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nIt's a really long story about what happened and how it happened, but I will try to condense it as much as I can. There are a lot of things that won't be made clear as a result, but I'll have to risk that. Otherwise this will be much longer than it already is.\n\nFirst off, I am going through a divorce, so in the meantime, I am staying with my mother. She lives with her sister and her two sons. One thing I want to make clear is that when it comes to the affairs of the house, I have absolutely no say. I get that and I am fine with that. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I came home and there was someone doing some sort of presentation. Cousin #1, who I will call S, was there. I excused myself to go to my room, but the guy insisted I stay. S asked that I stay as well, so I did. He wanted to show a water filtration and water softening system. Fine. No big deal. I liked what I saw. I didn't have any questions. Why would I? Now, I have to bring up that my aunt, the actual homeowner, is 96. She is hard of hearing and can barely understand what was being said, which was why she left it to us to deal with. And the salesman made it a point to tell us that if the homeowner is over 70 then they need two other members of the house to listen to the presentation to avoid accusations of elder abuse. That sounded fair to me so I hung around. S had some questions, but he had plans that he was eager to get to and he wasn't willing to make any decisions without his brother, who I will call C. The guy was going to come back later to talk to C, but as they were leaving, C came home. So they talked. I already heard all of this, so I went to my room. When I came out, they had already started installing the filtration system, so he must have said yes, right? I think you can see where this is going.\n\nAt one point, papers needed to be signed. C wasn't able to do it so he told me to sign. I agreed because, again, I thought he had agreed to everything and we would arrange for the payments later. Also, they were already halfway through the work, so I felt like there was no choice. Let me note that throughout the day, I made it clear I have to authority to say anything without C or S's word.\n\nIt wasn't until last week I discovered that I had signed for a $10,000 loan to cover it all. Plus the interest, it's going to be almost $20,000. \n\nWe thought we could cancel, but it turns out there is a three day cancellation policy. I didn't even know that was a thing. I suppose I could just refuse to pay, but I don't want a lien put on my aunt's house. I want to ask questions about the loan, but the number I was given the people don't have access to my account so they can't answer. I'll just have to wait for the loan packet to come in. \n\nI realize now that the reason they wanted more people to be a part of it all was to make things confusing, and it worked. There were a lot of miscommunications between me and my cousins.\n\nI am resigned that I will have to pay this. But I am looking at it as a hard and expensive lesson. But is there anything I can do? People are telling me to fight it, but I don't know where to start. Also, the salesman made sure to get it recorded that I was agreeing. But I really don't want anyone else to fall victim to this. Can I report this to someone? But I worry that if I report, they will only change their name and continue business as usual. Does anyone have any thoughts, ideas, or advice? \n\nAnd before you say it, let me remind you that this is the condensed version. There was a lot more going on than I had the time or room for. And I am fully aware that I was really stupid to let this happen to me. I will answer questions, except the name of the place, for obvious reasons. Thanks everyone for your thoughts and advice. I really appreciate it.",

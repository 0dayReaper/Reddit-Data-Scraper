    "postText": "Hello, my landlord is currently trying to evict me because I refuse to pay the electric bill which is not mentioned in my contract. I tried to clarify with him that the electric bill is not mentioned at all on my agreement and I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it at the moment. Immediately afterwards he threatened to evict me to which I again clarified that it is not on my contract for me to pay. After that he called me and threatened to evict me and I told him that I didn\u2019t want to have to take legal action at which point he got extremely angry and cursed me out over the phone then hung up. Im not at home right now and I called the police to let them know the situation and he has since cut off my electricity. That means my food is also spoiling. I need some help!\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with the police and a licensed attorney who both agreed that I am not liable to pay for the electricity and what my landlord has done is illegal. They called it a Illegal Lockout. So to the ones who were saying I was liable, and I say this in the kindest way possible, you were wrong, go back.",

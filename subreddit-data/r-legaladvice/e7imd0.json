    "postText": "Florida.\n\nI worked as head bartender for a local restaurant for a number of years, and there was a regular customer who was there very frequently. I interacted with this customer frequently: they tipped *exclusively* in scratch tickets and specifically called to ask for my schedule, asked me out on multiple occasions, et cetera. Probably about forty years my senior. If you've ever watched The Good Place, this guy was IRL Brent.\n\nI won something from the scratch ticket that wasn't five/ten dollars: the final amount after taxes was about three months salary for me, and I was making good money. I specifically didn't tell the customer not because I thought they would want it but because I didn't want them feeling like I owed them something or that I should be thankful towards them. I did tell a coworker, and it got to him through the grapevine.\n\nThe next time I came in, he congratulated me and asked how we wanted to split it. I sternly told him that it was my tip and long story short he went to my manager, who took his side. I quit (had been planning to anyway since I'm about to finish school).\n\nMy manager GAVE THIS GUY MY EMAIL (I'm curious on the legality of this too) and he (customer) emailed me saying that if I didn't agree to give him 50% he'd take legal action.\n\nDo I need to worry about taking his threat seriously? Is there anything I can or should do to protect myself? I'm assuming this is a bluff but I want to have my bases covered.\n\nTL;DR: Me drink lady. Mean man who buy many drinks gives me scratchy scratchy papers instead of green paper for many days. One day scratchy scratchy says me get a lot of green paper, but man no like this when he hear because he want some of green paper too. Me say no, green mine, so he say that he take swift and immediate legal action if me no comply. Me no need comply, right?",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.97 23/269ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

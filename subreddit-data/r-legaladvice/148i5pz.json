    "postText": "Hi. I was at the doctors office this morning and as I was checking in, the receptionist announced that I had an overdue bill of $50 for a specific service. It was very uncomfortable- the waiting area is very small and everyone could hear what she was saying. I paid the bill, but I just wish my information (medical and financial) wasn\u2019t announced to everyone in the office. \nI\u2019m trying to figure out if I should say something to my provider or just let it slide.",

Hope you can help me.\n\nMy employer reduced my salary by 20% because the company is not doing financially and promised to bring it back once the company is back on track. \n\nI just got my contract verified from the Philippines Consulate last week and my employer sent me an email today to sign a new contract with the 20% salary reduction.\n\nShould I sign?\n\nIs it possible to work on the same contract without the 20% reduction?\n\nDo i have to get my contract verified again of i sign?\n\nPlease advice thank you",

Although that would probably result in being terminated from that job, so I would recommend finding a different job instead.\n\nAs for whether or not you should sign, that\u2019s totally up to you. I personally wouldn\u2019t take a 20% reduction in pay without finding a different employer, but it\u2019s totally your choice. Assuming there isn\u2019t some length of time you are agreeing to work for in that reduction paperwork, then you could always take the lesser amount now and start looking for new jobs. Likewise, if you are agreeing to the new pay rate and also agreed to work for them for a specific length of time, perhaps it would not be in your best interest to sign. Perhaps you should refused to sign and start looking for a new job.",

I wouldn\u2019t sign but if you did - can you find another job in the meantime? Because what will you do if the company goes bankrupt and can\u2019t pay you at all?",

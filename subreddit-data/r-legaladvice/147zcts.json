Driver A is already in turning lane turning while Driver B goes through intersection at same time and turns. Both cars hit each other. There is no yield sign. Driver A and B are not issued a ticket. Who is at fault? Driver A, Driver B, or the country for not having yield signs on either sign of intersection (uncontrolled intersection with no yield or right of way signs).",

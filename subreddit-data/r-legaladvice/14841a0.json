    "postText": "So I just left a detox,/rehab. When I was signing out they were rushing me out the door because my driver was there so I signed for the medication they gave me but I also knew I had a pair of 400$ headphones when I intaked. I asked to see my intake paper and they had no answers for me. At this point I have to cut my losses and leave because the driver will leave and I won't have a ride to my sober living house. \n\nOn the ride back I get anxious and go to take my medication and realize they left 3 vital scripts out of the bag which I will now suffer for because I need them to function. \n\nI've been calling all day and they refuse to put me on the phone with anyone and they will only let me leave my name and number. \n\nWhat can I do? There must be some legal recourse. I signed a paper that had all my possessions on it for my intake and they couldn't get me that. \n\nI want legal recourse. Would a lawyer take my case? How would I start the process? \n\nMy headphones are the only thing of value that I have left after addiction took its toll, and my medication is vital. This is not okay I'm so upset and feel so helpless.",

If not in...lets say two days, you escalate and contact people higher up the food chain or that are more willing to help you. Do they have a patient relations person? Do they have an patient manager? \n\nAlso might help if you can show up again in person, explaining that you are there to pick up the things that you never got back. \n\nOtherwise, you're going to get a lawyer right away and do what? \n\nUltimately, if they can't find your things, and you have the intake sheet that shows you gave it to them, you can call the police for petty theft. Usually this would be coordinating through the facility's internal security. You can also sue them in small claims court... but both those things should happen after a few more days of trying to speak to them.",

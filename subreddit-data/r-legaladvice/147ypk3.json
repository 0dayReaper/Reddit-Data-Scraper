    "postText": "I live Suffolk county NY and both the village I live in and the town have laws against the trespass of Bamboo from neighboring land. I called both the town and village + put in official complains on their website to inform them that the bamboo from a water easement was trespassing into my property. Both told me that it would be too expensive to remove and they said to call the other to see if they would do anything about it and closed my report. I don't know what I can do or if I want to take legal action who I should talk to. I'm worried since the bamboo has grown something like 10 ft and spread over 20 ft since I made the initial complaint and I'm worried that my neighbors will take legal action against me if it spread from my property to theirs next. \n\nMy village seems to have very clear laws in this that say they need to do something about it. The town has its own similar laws but I can't find them online. \n\nhttps://ecode360.com/30842239\n\u00a7\u00a0152-14\nPlanting and maintenance of bamboo.\n\nIs there anythingni can do? The first quotes I got were astronomical since 100 yards of fence needs to be removed and a 4 ft deep Barrier needs to be installed under it to stop the spread since it's already taken over all of my neighbors property.",

            "comment": "This is outside my expertise, but some unlikely (but still possible) solutions could be:\n\n- Contact the EPA or the USDA. They may not look kindly upon the county allowing a presumably invasive species to grow unchecked. As a federal agency they may be able to compel the local government to act.\n\n- File a suit for damages (ongoing cost of removal, or the cost of preventative measures), citing negligence on the part of the local government. The fact they have laws on the record but are refusing to enforce them could work in your favor. However, this would be slow and expensive option so should be your last resort.",

    "postText": "So on the 26 I brought my car (an older ford Taurus) to the auto center to do a coolant exchange. They told me they would replace my coolant with new coolant, I was kind of skeptical because a coolant flush is normally 100-200 dollars from a mechanic.\nApparently they use a vacuum to extract the coolant from radiators with a plug accessible from the top of the car. Mine does not have radiator access like that, so the genius\u2019s stuck a vacuum in my coolant reservoir with a gallon of coolant flush, sucked up the liquid and left me with all the sediment and bad stuff. They were not supposed to do that. Had I known that it wasn\u2019t an actual flush wouldn\u2019t have done it. they screwed the cap on very tight, I guess to keep me from realizing for a while. I went and got a refund on the 28th. I said I wasn\u2019t going to pursue damages because i didn\u2019t think there was any aside from a waste of money. I didn\u2019t know how bad it was until my car started running poorly, after removing the hoses i saw some were clogged and the resovior was filled with brown gunk. And my coolant has oil and sparkles in it so not looking great.\n\nWhat should I do?\nI don\u2019t have the money to go to a mechanic so I\u2019m gunna be walking to work while I try and get my car going again.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AkdbSeL",

            "comment": "If you can prove that the work they performed caused damages that took money to repair, then you can sue them for that amount of money in small claims court. Since they already refunded, you cannot include the cost of the procedure. I'm not an expert (or lawyer) but it doesn't sound like their procedure did any damage, rather it failed to fix the preexisting issues (dirt in coolant, oil leak into coolant). If that's the case you won't be successful in suing them because they already refunded the unsuccessful procedure.",

    "postText": "Throwaway for anonymity. 2 weeks ago I was on my lunch break and forgot to set the parking brake in my vehicle. While I was picking up my order from the restaurant, my car rolled back approx 2-3 spaces and dinged another vehicle. I came out of the restaurant to see my cars tail end against the other cars door. Damage was superficial. Cracked tail light on my end, and some dents and scuffs on the passenger door of the other vehicle. Police were called, and information was exchanged. It was at this point we all discovered my insurance had lapsed and I had been unknowingly driving without insurance for approx 6 months (auto billing issue). Due to North Carolina state laws, any collision in a parking lot is considered to be private property and a civil issue. No charges or citations filed. Communicating with the other vehicles owner later that evening, he got very angry, was cursing and threatening, and I told him I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and to just have his insurance company send me the bill. Well, today, I get a text from the same number, from someone claiming to be his father (who co-runs a company with him) saying the repair bill was ready at the absolute most expensive dealership in town, and wanting to meet me there to take care of it. This seems fishy to me, as I was very clear I wanted to go through his insurance company, and also it isn\u2019t the driver texting me, it\u2019s his father (driver is a 40+ year old man) I can think of several ways this could be a scam, and while I would very much like to make this right, after his initial behavior, I just don\u2019t trust him and certainly don\u2019t want to meet him anywhere. I would be much more comfortable dealing with his insurance company, as it is very likely the mystery repairs he has had done will total much more than I can pay in one sitting. We live in Virginia, but the accident occurred in North Carolina. Any words of wisdom are greatly appreciated!",

Would the dealership give me the cost of repairs and services performed if I called and asked? It\u2019s an all to common scam out here for someone to be opportunistic and use a situation like this to get additional work done. Like I said, I have no problem doing everything I can to make this correct, I just don\u2019t want to be scammed for X amount over a super minor fender bender",

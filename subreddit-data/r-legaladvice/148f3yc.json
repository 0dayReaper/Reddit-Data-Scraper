    "postText": "TL;DR: Lawyer A from our original firm made critical mistakes, and we believe Lawyer B, who was also part of the firm we signed a contract with and joined the new firm, should take responsibility. We're not looking to sue for malpractice but want to discuss reduced rates. We haven't made progress in two years and paid a $10k retainer to the new firm, making our total expenses nearly $20k. Help us approach this discussion.\n\nHello - I need some advice on a legal situation we're facing, and I hope anyone can offer some guidance.\n\nA couple of years ago, we hired Lawyer A and his partner Lawyer B, who ran their own firm. We signed a contract with their firm to handle our case. However, things took a turn when Lawyer A and Lawyer B dissolved their firm and joined a new one. We had no choice but to sign a contract with the new firm, considering our ongoing legal matter.\n\nSoon after the transition, Lawyer A, who was primarily handling our case, abruptly left the new firm. Throughout our engagement with Lawyer A, Lawyer B had always been copied on our emails and involved to some extent but was mostly quiet while Lawyer A was handling the case. Now, Lawyer B is our main point of contact at the new firm, along with other team members.\n\nRecently, we discovered that Lawyer A made multiple critical mistakes, missing important deadlines and jeopardizing our case. Consequently, we've had to backtrack and spend time and money to rectify these errors. Shockingly, we are being billed in full for all the redundant work needed to catch up on Lawyer A's mistakes. Is this fair?\n\nWe want to discuss the possibility of reduced rates with the new firm since we haven't made any progress in over two years due to the lack of transparency and numerous mistakes. Our current bill stands at $10k+, and we're essentially paying for the time spent fixing Lawyer A's mess. It's frustrating to think that we paid a $10k retainer to the new firm, making our total expenses close to $20k.\n\nOur intention is not to sue for malpractice but to find a way to approach a discussion regarding reduced rates. We have written acknowledgment from the new firm, including Lawyer B, that Lawyer A messed up. However, they have not accepted responsibility for his actions.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How should we approach the new firm to discuss reduced rates and address this situation effectively? We're looking for advice and strategies to navigate this tricky situation.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

            "comment": "&gt;Is this fair?\n\nObviously we don't know what happened with these critical mistakes.  If a lawyer truly made an error, you shouldn't be charged for the time unwinding those.  And if A and B are now part of the same firm then I'd have a discussion with that from about those mistakes and what costs were correcting them.  \n\nIt is likely that you should ask for a meeting with A, B, and someone like a managing partner to discuss your situation.  And generally speaking your strategy is \"I'm happy to pay the fair value of the legal work received, but I question whether these *x* hours correcting what should have been accomplished in hours I paid to do it incorrectly should be billable.\"\n\n&gt;It's frustrating to think that we paid a $10k retainer to the new firm, making our total expenses close to $20k.\n\nUnderstand that what you paid in retainer payments isn't strongly related to hours billed.  A retainer is, in most cases, a deposit against future billable hours.  If this attorney shows you they marked some hours as non-billable because they were correcting an error and you still consumed the $20k, then all may be as it should be.",

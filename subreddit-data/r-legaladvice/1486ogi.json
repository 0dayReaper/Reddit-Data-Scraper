    "postText": "Attached is the post in question. He is basically accusing me of \"using a loophole tomuse \"his\" business name\" and that i persuaded my client to write poor reviews on every other charter companynin the area.  The following is the post it goes deeper in comments.i also have testimony from other clients stating he told them I was under indictment for stealing his business, and told a local mechanic I stole his .com etc.  I want to pursue defamation against him.personally. how do I go about this?  What more will I need other than the post, and testimony? \n\n\n\nTo my friends and colleagues in the charter business:\nIt\u2019s been brought to my attention that someone recently took the time and trouble to leave most everyone working in our area a negative review, whilst leaving ------------------- a five star review. Through the process of deduction and photos, I\u2019ve realized the following:\n\nLocal neophyte, ------------------- has been using the name --------------\u2010-----. through a loophole in the sunbiz system. He used to own ------------\nApparently, a client that used THEM on May 30th, then took the time to leave most local guides a negative review, while MISTAKENLY leaving our company a 5 star review. Not the LLC that is currently being used by ----------------. I am sorry for the confusion. \nI\u2019m sure all of you know that I am a family man, that prides himself on hard work, integrity, and providing memorable experiences for any and all of our clients. Johnny, and any other captain that benefits from ------------- does the same. We do not associate with people that have low scruples or moral integrity. \nAny Captain would like to further discuss, please feel free to call me. Thank you guys. I have enclosed photos to support what has happened. \ufffc\nIf you, gentlemen in the charter business would kindly share, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Thousands and thousands of dollars to pay your lawyers.\n2. Months if not years of time as this creeps through the courts.\n3. An actual case for defamation, including...\n4. Significant financial damages.",

He also.fills in the blanks with little.jabs like this accusation that I told customers to write bad reviews on everyone.l except.me..  I truly want to ignore it, but at this point I don't know how to. He has now made said mechanic stop working on my engine, many clients will not return. I go to.local restaurants for a good.timw and I'm harassed by people he has convinced I \"stole\" from him. I own the business llc and trade mark the name I feel im.genuinely out of options.",

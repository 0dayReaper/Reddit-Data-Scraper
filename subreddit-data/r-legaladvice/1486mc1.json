    "postText": "Hello all, writing on behalf of my wife.\n\nShe has restraining orders on her parents, that are about to expire. She received an email from her 17 yo brother who still lives with them, him wanting contact with her, but there's clear signs the parents are behind it based on wording that he doesn't use. \n\nShe's writing an email back to him explaining that none of it is his fault, but that by keeping in contact with him, then it leaves the door open for her parents to try to get back into her life.\n\nA sentence of her email says \"My life is better without (parents names) in it.\" Because she knows full well that her parents will read the email and she wants the point across to stay out of her life (they failed to take any hints, including the restraining orders, they still showed up and tried breaking in but local LE doesn't care to enforce them)\n\nWould that constitute as some sort of verbal assault or slander or any bs that could end us up in court with them?",

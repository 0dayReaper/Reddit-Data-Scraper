    "postText": "Friend's adult child, who may or may have not been under the influence, was in an incident that ended up with a pedestrian dead. I don't have much more info than that but it sounds like he was driving the vehicle that caused a death. Friend is trying to help her son get legal help including speaking to a lawyer with a 50k retainer fee. There's a likelihood to a long drawn out trial and investigation.\n\nIs that the best option for her? Are there more reasonable options for legal defense? Thanks for any advice!",

Obviously this is a life altering event. If your friend has the money, it may be worthwhile. Of course, she can speak with multiple attorneys to see who they like best.",

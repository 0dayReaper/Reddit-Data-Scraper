    "postText": "My parents are probably getting divorced within the next year or two (my mom wants to divorce him, he doesn\u2019t know it yet, I\u2019m 24 for context). My dad is NOT a good person and I fully support my mom and I want to help her out as much as I can. \nThe thing is, though both my parents worked for most of their marriage, my dad recently lost his job and will probably have a difficult time finding a new one given his age (late 50s) and disabilities. If he gets on disability, does that clear my mom of her needing to pay spousal report to my dad? Or at least reduce it for her? For context this is in Ohio and they share a house as their asset. All my siblings and I are adults so there aren\u2019t any dependents.",

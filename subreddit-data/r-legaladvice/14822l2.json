    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI live in a town/city in MA and was sent a letter by the town telling us to stop selling flowers through a farm stand that we set up once or twice a month for the summer months. According to zoning in our town, a farm stand can only be set up if the property is 5 or more acres, or 2 acres and generates $1,000 per acre. Our plot is about 0.33 acres and we were unaware that we couldn't do this obviously. \n\nMy wife is basically doing this as a hobby with the hope to turn this into something bigger and we're scared that this means that we cannot grow the flowers anymore for the purpose of selling them. Are we interpreting the cease and desist wrong and we just can't do the farm stands? Other than the farm stands she arranges bouquets and such and has some people pick up arrangements and delivers them. She wants to eventually expand to maybe doing farmers markets. But we also don't want to get in trouble.\n\n The letter wasn't very clear if only the farm stand was the issue. The letter basically cited the Zoning Ordinance and explained that we didn't qualify for the Agricultural exception. It stated at one point that operating a retail flower shop business in a residential zone is prohibited, but then the last sentence basically is telling us to cease and desist from operating a farm stand on the property. Are we just being paranoid here? We're a little afraid that reaching out to the town will slam the door on this entirely and we're just wondering what we can do to still be in compliance before contacting the town about it.\n\nThanks!",

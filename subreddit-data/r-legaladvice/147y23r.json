    "postText": "So I\u2019m not sure if this counts as a class action lawsuits or not but that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out haha! \nMinecraft was possessed by Microsoft in 2014, since then the game has had tons of changes, one of the biggest ones was how to log in. Microsoft changed the log-in from typical Mojang to Microsoft log-in, prompting all users to transfer their accounts from Mojang to Microsoft through a mostly painless process. However, many people, myself included, have now faced a bug where if you had a Mojang account that became tethered to a Microsoft account, Microsoft claims you no longer own the game and have to buy it over. I\u2019ve done some research via reddit, microsoft answers, and google and I\u2019ve found dozens of posts with likes, upvotes, replies of agreement, from those who are long time players of Minecraft being forced to re-purchase it. Microsoft\u2019s replies to these claims has simply been that these people are fabricating it and have never actually owned it, but in 2011, Minecraft didn\u2019t send confirmations of purchase.\n\nI have two pieces of evidence on my side showing that I owned the game; I also have a smaller piece that I\u2019m not sure counts.\n1. I emailed my dad in 2011 that I wanted to purchase it, noting it was \u20ac14.50 at the time and would eventually cost \u20ac20.00 if he didn\u2019t hurry up and buy it for me. Lol!\n2. My old computer, partially out of commission, still has Minecraft on it with me perfectly logged in. Showing that I have the full version of the game. \n\nObviously each purchase of the game (depending on when purchased) only ranges from $21.50 to $30 (both USD) but if it\u2019s happening to as many people as I\u2019m seeing online I\u2019m wondering what the outcome could be for each person in a class action? Even if it\u2019s just they all get a version of the game or $30 since that\u2019s what it\u2019s worth now.  \n\nAny help appreciated, thanks.\n\nEDIT+INFO: I meant to specify at least 500 other people are having this problem according to Microsoft Answers",

The final account conversion fixed it.",

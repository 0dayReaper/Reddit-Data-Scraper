    "postText": "I am about to file for divorce (California). I spoke to 2 attorneys in august last year that were recommended from a benefits program at work. The first one was very rushed through the consult.  The second was responsive, thorough, spoke plainly and clearly and even did a second consult with me when my spouse threatened to ruin me financially.  I\u2019ve read the testimonials from her website, didn\u2019t see any other place to see reviews, and I have a good feeling about her.  But should I do anything else to make a final decision on retaining her services? I\u2019ve asked friends for recommendations but they don\u2019t have any. Are there any questions I should ask her (I.e. interview her) before retaining her services? TIA",

How much does she estimate the case will cost?  Does she work with junior lawyers or paralegals who can do some of the leg work to save you money?  What is her policy on how quickly she responds to emails or phone calls?  \n\n(Make sure you understand that you'll be charged for virtually every minute of her time.)",

    "postText": "I am an international PhD student in an University in Texas. I have been working for the last 2 months as a teaching assistant for the summer classes. My school decided to decrease our weekly hours and salary by half for the semester and they said this also includes the 2 months I already worked. Can they do this ? Is there anything I would need to do to make sure I at least get paid the full amount paid for the 2 months already worked?",

They are saying due to students dropping the classes there is not enough student to require full time TA anymore and that makes sense but I am not sure how can they change the pay for the time I already worked",

I would consider what they're offering an alternative to that, \"we'll reduce your hours but we need to also reduce your salary\".\n\nAssuming you are fine with having your appointment revoked, the previous 2 months probably needs to be paid at the rate they laid out in the contract. Have you not been paid for the previous 2 months? How would they get the money back for you?",

Their payment system is tied to academic semesters so I got paid for my work on spring semester last month and I am going to get my first summer check in 3 days. I will try to meet with them and see if there is any other work they can assign me to keep me on the original agreed payment",

I agree it does seem odd that they can retroactively change how much they're paying you and if you really wanted to fight then you could probably get the full amount for the time you've already done.... But they would probably retaliate by letting you go from the TA position. :/",

    "postText": "My girlfriend was furious. Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. \n\nI just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.\n\nEdit: This is in Arizona.\n\nEdit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him \"throw it out\" and risk it being submitted. The reason the ballot did not come to us is because he signed her up for early voting and put his address as the place to mail it. We live in a different city. ",

It's a Class 5 felony in Arizona and carries about 2 years in prison\nhttps://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/01006.htm",

The person who cannot vote now because of voter fraud.\n\n2. Every other voter else is a victim because their vote doesn't count as much as the person fraudulently voting.\n\nThink of it this way, let's say the only person in the country that committed voter fraud in any manner was OP's gf's father. Because of his actions, the number of votes everyone cast would look like\n\n- OP's GF: 0\n\n- OP's GF's Father: 2\n\n- Every other voter: 1\n\nIs it right that the father gets to vote twice while everyone else gets to only vote once? Of course not, the whole US voting system is based on \"One Person, One Vote.\" Because of this principle, ***ANYONE*** can report voter fraud if they know it is occurring. For example, the Supreme Court declared in [*Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Estimate_of_City_of_New_York_v._Morris) that because the voters of Staten Island (the least populated borough in NYC) had a greater voice than the voters of Brooklyn (the most populated borough), the voting method used by the Board of Estimate of the City of New York violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nNote: The only exception to One Person, One Vote is in Congress. And that is only because the US Constitution says it is exempt.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. \n&gt; \n&gt; I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

I just realized they were out there since Sunday in the humidy and just now a passing storm with heavy rain, wind,, lightning and thunder. They are literally out there all day barking, whimpering and crying. What should I do? Should I confront the neighbor or call the humane society? I don't want to jump to conclusions but I feel guilty I didn't realize sooner.",

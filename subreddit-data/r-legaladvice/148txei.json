    "postText": "So it has been 15 months of me working at my current job. As soon as I was hired I was being told how easy it is to move up in the company and to learn new things, and in turn get more money with raises. So I learned a couple of things trying to move up and I expected to be certified in what I learned and given the raise I was supposed to receive for those positions. So I waited and asked my manager about my certification/raise and he said that I have to work without someone watching over me for two weeks so I did that. After the two weeks were up there\u2019s was nothing so I asked again the next week and I was give ln a different answer of 6 weeks instead of 2\u2026 I reluctantly waited the 6 extra weeks and asked again and was told that it had changed to 6 months\u2026 by this point I was already agitated because of a third delay on my raise. By the time my 6 extra months were up I was told to \u201cjust be patient\u201d but the company still showed no signs of giving anyone raises and by this point I realized it wasn\u2019t just me they were dragging along but many of my coworkers. So 9 months with no certifications or raises and I have been trained for 3 different things but am still making base pay. When asked again, my manager said that they were working on giving people raises and we were going to receive back pay as well for the months we have been certified. I was finally certified in one position a month ago, so I took that as I would only be getting one month of back pay instead of the 10 months I\u2019ve been working in my position. A new production manager came on the floor a while ago trying to get us to get trained and do yet another job that isn\u2019t ours, and it requires another certification which I doubt they will give us anytime soon. I don\u2019t want to go off on anyone but my patience is wearing very thin and I don\u2019t know what else to do. I don\u2019t want to quit because this isn\u2019t a bad job they just won\u2019t pay us what we deserve. Upper management will not listen to what we have to say even though they say they will. I just wanted you alls advice on this and to see if I\u2019m overreacting about it. Thanks in advance.",

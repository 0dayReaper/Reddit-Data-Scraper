    "postText": "Hi, please no judgment! I have an arrangement with an older man who does property development and an investor throughout Chicago. He is giving me a 1 bedroom building to live in while I\u2019m in college. He sent me over the lease contract and told me to add in how I\u2019d like it. He\u2019s told me I can put in $1 or $1500 (to show my parents) but he owns the building so it\u2019s payed for by him including electric and water. However before I officially move should I legally formalize this agreement or how else should I protect myself during this? My worries are if one day he cheats on me and tries to kick me out or we just get upset at one another and threatens to evict me. He has also asked me if I would like for him to install security cameras but only if I\u2019m comfortable with it I can set it up through my phone or he can see too (only on outside of the area). I\u2019m pursuing my education so that I can rely on myself in the future, too. I do this as I come from a poor family so again please no judgment, believe me.",

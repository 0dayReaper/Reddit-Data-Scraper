    "postText": "My girlfriend entered a lease for an apartment and the lease ended in January of this year which she had paid every month for on time. She\u2019s been paying month to month since then on time and it was supposed to be $1065 but the website she pays rent on would only let her pay $975 a month. The website did not let her change the amount or select different options for payment.\n\nNow it is June, and the landlord contacted her for the very first time about this and said she has not been paying the correct amount of rent. They are saying she needs to back pay $510 for all of the amount she hasn\u2019t paid since January. \n\nDoes she have to do this? If she was in a lease or some type of agreement I would understand. But if she\u2019s not in a lease or some type of agreement, what grounds do they have to charge her this amount?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, her apartment includes an outdoor closet that she has requested the key for 5 times since she moved in and they still have not given it to her. They also have a pool that she has requested the key for multiple times and they have not given that to her either.\n\nThanks in advance!",

She can't just keep the money because the online payment system had an issue.\n\nAlso, she is on a lease. The terms of the lease converted to a month to month lease. \n\nGet asking for a key to the outdoor closet or pool is a seperate issue. She should confirm the lease includes access to those.",

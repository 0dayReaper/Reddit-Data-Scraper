            "comment": "What class license do you have? D or DJ? If it's DJ, then no. It's region-dependent, but upstate, you can't drive with more than one passenger under the age of 21. In New York City, you can't drive at all. In Long Island, you need to have a supervising driver who is an adult and it needs to be a parent, guardian, *in loco parentis*, or driving instructor.\n\nA 17 year-old can have a class D if you took the test to get your DJ converted, which allows you to drive unsupervised. You need to know what kind of license you have. There is no such thing as as \"under 21\" driver's license. The only restriction is commercial class A licenses require you to be 21. You don't need that to drive a regular passenger vehicle.\n\nBeware that if you're going out of state, it matters what state, because you need to follow their laws, too.",

    "postText": "I am posting on behalf of my mother who is currently going through a serious incident. She had been renting a wooden house in NSW, Australia to a couple of landlords - a husband and wife who reside in the adjacent property. The relationship with the landlords has been uneasy, with instances of inappropriate behaviour from the husband, but unfortunately, we have no written evidence to support this. My mum has told me that, in private, he admitted to being disappointed that nothing will happen between them. I've myself only witnessed him making inappropriate jokes when he thought I wasn't there. He's also offered to lend my mother heaters and money behind his wife's back, and the wife was furious when she found out. This is probably unrelated, but it provides some context as to why the wife is adamantly going after my mum.\n\nEarlier today, my mum discovered that the entire house had been burnt down to ashes, with a fire truck already at the scene. She was in the process of moving to a new home when this event happened and was away from the property at the time of the fire.\n\nThe landlords are now accusing her of causing the fire and are refusing to return her bond, despite her assuring that she left the house with the heaters turned off. This is quite distressing as she had only left a TV and some food in the refrigerator, with most of her belongings already moved to the new house.\n\nMy mother has reported the incident to the police and is currently at the police station. The landlords, along with their four children, live right next to the property and have unrestricted access. My mum has told me multiple times that she's come home to her house cleaned by the owner (in fact, he had cleaned her shoes, which is... odd) and she found this quite inappropriate, mostly because he is going inside her rented home without her permission. The house is wooden and had an oil heater and a fireplace with a chimney, all installed by the owners themselves.\n\nShe didn't have any renter's insurance on the property and is now worried about the potential outcomes, specifically the wife's accusations and intentions to sue my mother.\n\nWe are seeking advice on how she can protect herself legally in this situation and what her potential risks may be. Any information about how she could possibly defend herself from the accusations would be extremely helpful.\n\nIf more information is needed, I am happy to provide further details. Thank you all in advance.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, the police have informed us that a fire investigator will be conducting an investigation. We're hopeful that this investigation will provide some much-needed clarity, particularly around the state of the heaters at the time of the fire.\n\nOur main concern lies in the landlords' history of entering the house without permission. It's conceivable that they could have entered the house after my mother had left, knowing she would be away for a while due to her move. If they turned on the heaters and this led to the fire, it could give the appearance that my mother was responsible. If it was the heater, I hope that the investigation is somehow able to establish a timeline for when the heater was turned back on.",

            "comment": "Sorry to hear about your mom's situation. That sounds like a real nightmare! I'm not a lawyer, but here are a few things you guys need to consider:\r  \n\r  \nKeep working with the police: Make sure she cooperates fully with the investigation and provides any evidence or information they need. That way, there's an official record of what happened.\r  \n\r  \nGather evidence: If your mom has any proof that she left the heaters off, like photos or witnesses, she should gather that. It could be really helpful in her defense. The more evidence she can provide, the stronger her case might be.\r  \n\r  \nGet a lawyer: Posting here can be helpful but, given the gravity of your situation, you absolutely are going to need a lawyer. Lawyers can provide you with the best options available based on your circumstances. If cost is a concern, you can consider contacting a community legal centre, or Legal Aid NSW, for assistance.\r  \n\r  \nDocument everything: Start collecting and maintaining all possible evidence related to this event. This could be conversations with the landlords, photos before and after the incident, etc. Since the landlords were entering her home without permission, and you have any kind of evidence, even circumstantial (for example, you found things moved around or noticed the landlords in the vicinity when they had no reason to be there), keep a record of these instances.\r  \n\r  \nI know this is general advice, but make sure you tick all these boxes. Good luck, and I hope everything works out for your mom.",

You can use the link below to access that:\n\nhttps://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/renting/rental-bonds-online\n\nThey have 14 days to respond or the money is returned automatically. They're presumably going to claim all of it given they believe your mum burned down the house. \n\nDepends what the fire investigator says. The idea the landlords went over and burnt down their own property after your mum had basically moved out seems unlikely. \n\nThey can sue your mother, in which case she'll need a lawyer. \n\nhttps://find-a-barrister.nswbar.asn.au/",

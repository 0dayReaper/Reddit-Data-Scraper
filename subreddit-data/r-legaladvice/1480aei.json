    "postText": "I live with a roommate. We\u2019re both on the lease, but her bf isn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t realize he \u201cmoved in\u201d- he\u2019s there\u2019s a lot during the day, but I work at night and my roommate never told me anything about sleeping over. So he\u2019s technically been paying some rent (half of my roommates rent, so 1/4 of the rent overall). The thing is I fucking hate him and my roommate won\u2019t make him move out, even though he\u2019s not on the lease. I would like to report him to the landlord, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some sort of punishment I could get since it would look like I knew about it. I don\u2019t really care about burning that bridge with my roommate as I\u2019m not renewing my lease, but the bf has to go. He\u2019s rude, makes a mess and doesn\u2019t clean up, runs up our electricity bill (over 200$ bill for a 2 bed apartment now), screams at his video games at 3am, always has people over w/I giving me a heads up, etc. I\u2019ve tried to talk to my roommate about him but nothing ever changes. I\u2019ve thought of offering just to transfer my lease to him so I can just move out now, but there\u2019s no  ay he could pay half the rent, so i don't think the landlord would allow it. \n\nanyway to get him out without getting any fines myself?",

            "comment": "No. You both both are in the same lease then you are equally liable for your roommate subletting. The landlord is going to serve you both notice to kick him out and evict him if you don't.\n\nNow, if you have a seperate lease that only lists your name, meaning you rent a room and share the common space, then you would not get in legal trouble. This is common in college housing. Your roommate could get evicted and you would be fine. Although your roommate could tell him to leave, stay, and be difficult to live with.\n\n&gt; I\u2019ve thought of offering just to transfer my lease to him so I can just move out now, but there\u2019s no ay he could pay half the rent, so i don't think the landlord would allow it.\n\nYour landlord doesn't have an obligation to accept him as a tenant.",

That said, the structure of the lease matters. If you're the only one on your lease, you can push your landlord to enforce without fear of that enforcement landing on you.",

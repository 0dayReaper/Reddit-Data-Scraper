    "postText": "I (18m) was working for a family owned small engine repair shop(4 other employees including the two owners) this past winter. It was January 25, 2023. I was delivering a snowblower to some older customers, and as I was unloading the snowblower out of the back of the pickup truck, I started to slip backwards and I fell. The snowblower was a massive 38\u201d snowblower, weighing almost 300 pounds, and the truck was almost empty, so it sat much higher, give the ramps a very steep angle. The weight of the snowblower pushed me backwards, where I slid on a compacted snow. I hit about 1/4 of an inch above my right eye, knocking me unconscious. I was out for a few seconds. I got a grade 3 concussion. I don\u2019t remember much of the accident, thankfully the truck the company provided me had a rear facing dash-cam. I missed 6 weeks of my senior year of high school, 8 weeks of pay (I got another job after the accident) and almost missed all of my college application deadlines. I was hit with thousands of dollars in medical bills, as my fathers insurance rejected it all.  The company claimed I was a 1099, even though I clearly wasn\u2019t. At the time, i didn\u2019t even know what a 1099 was. I have these huge medical bills, since I had multiple scans and appointments with all kinds of doctors (neurologists, physical therapists, my regular PCP, the emergency room). My father reached out to multiple injury lawyers in-state and in Boston (we live in ME), and every one has rejected the case, saying it\u2019s too complicated. The state workers comp board started building a case, but hasn\u2019t said anything to me yet (about a month). I still have daily migraines, headaches, loss of memory, loss of focus, and personality changes, along with constant back, neck, and shoulder pain. What can I do? I greatly appreciate any and all help.",

            "comment": "You will likely need to sue them for reimbursement and coverage. It's going to be extremely hard to find a lawyer because it's a small bussiness, you only missed 8 weeks of pay, they're claiming your a contractor, it's been over 6 months and you moved on to a job. The money a lawyer will make won't even cover their expenses, (worker comp attorney fees are regulated). \n\nBest option is to find a new lawyer looking for experience.",

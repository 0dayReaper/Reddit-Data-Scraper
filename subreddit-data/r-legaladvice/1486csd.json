There is a child support case opened I\u2019ve had two court dates already both reset because he\u2019s not showing up. \nI need help finding the right paperwork to fill out. I live in Texas. Both of do same county. It\u2019s just so confusing and I\u2019m lost. Terribly lost. I don\u2019t have the funds for legal advice. Texaslawhelp.org is so confusing to me. \nPlease if anyone has any advice or gone through similar experiences help a girl out",

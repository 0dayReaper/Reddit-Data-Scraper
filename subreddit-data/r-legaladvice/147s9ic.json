    "postText": "Can *tortious interference* apply to a situation where someone is preventing you from fulfilling your tax obligation to the IRS?\n\nSituation: Divorce settlement with both spouses obligated to equally split tax debt of a prior year, when both were married that entire year. Spouse 1 pays their share. Spouse 2 doesn't. Spouse 1 suffers financial harm because of it, while IRS maintains it as joint liability, technically preventing Spouse 1 from fulfilling their tax obligation.",

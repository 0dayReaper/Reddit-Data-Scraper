    "postText": "I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, I\u2019ve been a lurker for a while but have never needed legal advice until now.\n \nMy younger sister (18) has recently found solid evidence of my dad cheating on my mom and it has obviously rocked our world. We aren\u2019t certain if behind the scenes they have an arrangement, but I\u2019m very doubtful as my mother is an extremely religious, traditional woman. We are planning on telling our mother in a little bit as she is currently on vacation and we don\u2019t want to ruin it for her, but our main concern is she won\u2019t live comfortably without our dad\u2019s income, she won\u2019t get any child support because we\u2019re adults, and we\u2019re both too young and broke to help (I\u2019m only 20.) They have been married for 26 years and for that entire duration my mother has never had a full time job, she\u2019s almost completely financially dependent on him. \n\nBecause they\u2019ve been married for so long and he cheated on her, we both think she\u2019s eligible for alimony, but I wanted to be sure of this before I uproot her entire life and tell her to divorce him. She has a part time job and because of that has enough money to sustain herself throughout proceedings (hopefully, I don\u2019t know how divorce works really.) We\u2019re in North Carolina, USA.",

            "comment": "I think the best thing you could do for your mother (in the legal sense) is to help her find a good family lawyer that you mother can consult with, confidentially, before your mother makes any decisions.  A lawyer can give your mother an idea of how likely she is to get alimony, and how much that might be.  The lawyer can also help your mother understand what share of the marital property she could expect to get.",

            "comment": "Most divorces are what's considered no fault as establishing fault is very expensive and doesn't really worth the squeeze. \n\nThe divorce will split the marital assets. It's possible she'll also get alimony, but that's up to her lawyer to deal with. \n\nThat's all assuming she wants to after you tell her.",

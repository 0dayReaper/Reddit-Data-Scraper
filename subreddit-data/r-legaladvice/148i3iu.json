    "postText": "I\u2019m cleaning my previous house that I rented and noticed in my agreement that it says, \u201cas the oven was brand new at the time of move in, you will be required to hire a professional to clean the oven and are required to provide receipts at the end of your tenancy\u201d. \n\nCan I not just clean it my self? Also would there not be some usual wear and tear in regards to it having black marks that are caked on from cooking? \n\nDoes the tenancy fees act cover me from this also, I read that your landlord cannot force you to hire out for cleaning the home? \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!",

The definition of cleanliness on a wear item is not something tied to a measurable metric. The failure belongs with the property owner for failing to outline what state it has to be in when \"handed back\". I am not advocating for you to not clean the stove, but don't sweat the small stuff. If they hold your deposit longer than the agreed upon period and fail to return to you your deposit, I think you can bring it up with the local governing bodies for renter's protection. No one wants this escalation and you will likely get back your deposit promptly if you prove that you followed the rules outlined in your lease. The owner of the property should then understand that an appliance is a utility, and as such, it depreciates by the day. Let it be their learning experience.\n\n**NAL, of course.

Any paid individual is a professional (as opposed to amateur whom is unpaid).  Doesn't make them good, just makes them professional.  So anybody you pay any amount for any effort in doing this meets the requirement.  Find a buddy and Venmo them $20 for an hour of oven cleaning time, even if they just came and consumed pizza while you cleaned lol.\n\nIn the end, just make sure it's returned in a very clean \"like new\" status.  Not sure how long you've lived there, but some good cleaner and a little elbow grease goes a long way in that.  Move the oven, sweep under it, and take a razor to the door window (just avoid the seal) if you have grime built up.",

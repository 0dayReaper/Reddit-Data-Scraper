    "postText": "Hoping for some clarification on this. Im in the UK.\n\nI work full time in a profession where extra-contractual work is common.\n\nI do this extra-contractual work fairly regularly through an agency.\n\nI'm aware of relatively recent changes to UK law surrounding \"rolled up holiday pay\" but not clear if this law is being broken in this situation.\n\nWhen agreeing to work, the agency will send a \"confirmation of shifts\" PDF which included hours, location and rate of pay. On this document, they state that \"all rates include 12.08% holiday pay\" and then on your eventual payslip, the notes section at the bottom makes the same statement.\n\nHowever in the bulk of the payslip, there is no breakdown of pay into hourly rate and holiday pay.\n\nIt seems to me that the agency are agreeing a rate with the employing company, probably charging them more for their own fees, then by including holiday pay in my take home pay, they're de facto skimming that 12.08% off for themselves as well.\n\nIs this illegal with regards to rolled up holiday pay, or is it legal because they're open about it and by accepting the shifts, I am agreeing to these terms?\n\nThanks in advance",

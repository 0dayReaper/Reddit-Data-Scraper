    "postText": "There are currently five assistant managers at the smaller retail store I work for. I am one of those assistants and have been for about a year now. We have three sets of keys, but the store manager holds onto theirs permanently, while the other two sets are bounced between the other five of us. Because there are only two sets of keys, if someone has a few days off they are expected to leave the keys for the other assistants that need them. However, if that same person is scheduled to open the store on their first day back (which is quite often), they must come into the store to get the keys on their day off. We are not paid for the time we are going to pick up the keys. The store manager lives about thirty minutes from the store, so they do not put their set of keys into circulation because they don't want to have to pick them up. However, we are expected to take time out of our day to do exactly that.\n\nWhen I asked my boss about whether it was considered working off the clock, they said that the company did not consider it to be and that us assistants need to coordinate the keys better. There really isn't a better way to \"coordinate\" the keys when there are only two sets. They also told me that this happens in every store. I didn't want to fight my boss on this when we were talking, but it really feels like working off the clock. I have to drive 10 minutes in and 10 minutes back, so grabbing the keys does eat up about 25 minutes every time I have to do it. Does this really happen in every store? Is this something that I should bring up again, or should I not worry about it and just pick up the keys like normal?",

If you're doing something that takes a few minutes, that would probably be considered de minimis work and you wouldn't be entitled to compensation for it.  Commute time isn't paid in any state.\n\nWhat they're doing is legal.  If you show up and work for more than about 5-10 minutes you move out of de minimis and into a situation where you're owed pay for time worked.",

Courts have ruled that things like logging in to check an email, or even waiting 15 minutes at a security checkpoint have been de minimis and not paid work time.",

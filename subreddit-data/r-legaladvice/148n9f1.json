I would ignore this as a very empty threat until and if the unlikely event you're actually served with a lawsuit. But wow, grow up and stop engaging with random people on Twitter like that.\n\nA lawsuit, however unlikely, isn't impossible in a case like this. I will note that Elon Musk was famously sued for a very similar childish tweet. He prevailed, but it still went to trial.",

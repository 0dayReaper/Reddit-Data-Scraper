    "postText": "Hi there I recently bought a car through cazoo, wish I didn't now. Basically as soon as I got it I booked it in to my local audi garage for a full inspection ( 2 weeks) into my 90 day warrenty they found a few issues nothing major probably around \u00a3600 worth. Been trying to get them to sort these issues but they are a absolute nightmare to deal with I even sent them the video inspection. My question is does motor legal protection cover any of this. Been waiting about a month now to get any kind of decision from them. Paid cash no finance if that makes any difference",

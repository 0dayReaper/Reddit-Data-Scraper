    "postText": "I lived in Texas for several years in the mid-aughts. I had out-of-state plates for a while and kept getting pulled over for nonsense in those tiny towns you have to drive through to get anywhere.  Before I moved, I was sure I had cleared everything up/paid any fines. I was 25 when I relocated to Maryland and traveled a lot for two years, so I didn't immediately get a Maryland driver's license; when I did, I didn't have any issues. \n\nFast-forward 8 years and I'm trying to renew my license in MD and can't because my name is on the National Driver Registry for an (allegedly) unpaid fine from a traffic stop in BF Texas in 2007. It's almost $800! \n\nThe state is asking me to provide proof of payment to expunge the record, but I closed that account over ten years ago and have no means of proving that I satisfied that debt.  Apparently, some law firm from Dallas initially purchased that debt but then sold it to some law firm in San Antonio. \n\nAny advice on how I can get out of this situation, or at least get the fine reduced to something reasonable? I don't have the funds for this right now, and have to get it settled by mid-August. TIA!",

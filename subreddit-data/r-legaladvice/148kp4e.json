I took it to my dealership and it's going to cost me $2000 to fix. \nCan I get a refund from my mechanic since the work they did didn't work and they replaced a part needlessly? \nWhat can I say to my mechanic to incline him to refund my money? \n\nMy car was having AC issue where it would blow strong cold air in the morning but stop blowing by the afternoon and only work again on the same day if I gave my car a break. I'm a delivery driver so I'm in my car all day. \nMy mechanic first charged me for and changed my air filter. No good.\nThen he charged me about $500 for a new fan. STILL no good. \nThen they recommend I go to the dealership and they diagnosed it and found out my thermofil(?) Was frosting over and that was preventing it from blowing. It's going to cost me $2000 to fix.\nI'm so mad my mechanic charged me to fix a specific issue, my AC, but none of his work fixed it and now I have to spend even more money to really get it fixed. \n\nAm I entitled to any refund? Either for parts and/or labor? I know a service was done, but it was incorrect. Why would I have to pay for incorrect work? How many incorrect times would I have to pay for incorrect work before it became outrageous because I think 1 time is too many.",

If she was a 40 year old who got struck by lightning then that would be less suspicious.\n\nDo you believe that you sister could have forged the will?\n\nDo you believe that your sister may have bullied your mother into signing?\n\nDo you think your sister killed your mother? (Call the police if so)\n\nDid your sister have a better relationship with your mother than you? Maybe the will reflects her true feelings.",

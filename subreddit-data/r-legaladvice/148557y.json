    "postText": "I was recently hired to a bigger company and was really excited to work as my disability prevented me from working the past 2 years. \n\nI went to a \"Women in Trades\" job fair with the company that offered welding as a new career or continuing career. I applied to welding and was contacted later by an HR rep for the company. She had called and let me know immediately that the conversation would be recorded so HR can review it and see if I am the right fit for the position. (with all the applicants i guess they needed HR reps to help sort the applications)\n\nShe asked if i had previous welding experience and I had said no and that I would be changing careers to do this. She had said I needed experience... which threw me off since they were offering it as a new career as in theyd train us, anyways... and that without it I wouldnt be able to get the position. She then asked why I wanted to go into it, so I explained that my disability prevents me from mid weight- heavy lifting/constant bending and i thought welding would be a perfect fit. So after typical interview questions she said \"okay we do have other openings so I will send your interview over to the HR at this location and see if there's anything available for you\". I said thank you and waited for her call.\n\nShe called back 15 min later and said this location has a Laser Operator position open and its a perfect fit. No lifting or bending, just operating the computer and some crane work. I agreed this would be perfect fit. \n\nThe next interview was with HR of the location and she had asked the same questions as HR rep... but why laser operator and then I explained to her the whole welding reasoning for my disability and that the HR rep explained that id be operating the computer and some crane work. She agreed and later on hired me.\n\nFirst day at work, I realized that their operators dont just run the computers they also do repairs (tools and parts are extremely heavy) and lifting the multiple sheets of metal off of the bed of the laser and placing them on palets, lots of bending and lifting. So I talked to my supervisor immediately and told him everything and he got audibly angry, he called them \"fu*king idiots\" and immediately got me back into HR to find a new position for me. \n\nThey found an other position but left out the fact that i'd be bent and scrunched up for extended amount of time trying to seal the forrestry vehicles theyre building. I worked the 3x12hr shifts and immediately felt the pain and contacted HR again to ask if I could go to part-time since the job had a lot of bending which I wasn't supposed to do. \n\n2 hours later HR sent an email and stated I was terminated. \n\nSo I got terminated for their mistakes. \n\nI don't know if I can do anything... like fight it and try to get part time because I absolutely need to work ***or*** it'll be a losing fight that I shouldn't even try because I was still new. \n\nWhat should I do?",

    "postText": "A friend of mine was walking her (leashed) 10# little dog when all of a sudden an unleashed Great Dane charged at them from across a suburban street and attacked the small dog and killed it.  My friend is as traumatized as you can imagine.  The large dog was taken by animal control and \"detained\" for a day or two.  The owners were fined some token amount due to having a \"nuisance animal\" and were ordered to place a sign in their yard declaring \"Dangerous Dog.\"  My friend is wondering what legal recourse she might have regarding suing the dog's owner, and by extension the dog owner's homeowner's insurance company.  She says she's not after the money, but she will for SURE need long-term therapy for her PTSD.  I told her that the insurance company will want to settle this long before it gets to court, and that she's definitely owed some damages in the form of money, even though it won't bring her dog back.  Her other goal is to have the dog put down, but I told her that's likely not going to happen until the dog bites a human.  Any input from this group would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",

It sounds like animal control has already handled this event the way they chose to handle it.  If that way is inconsistent local law, she can file a complaint.",

I think you are 100% correct.\n\nBut...what about my friend's emotional pain and suffering she incurred by witnessing such a horrific event?  I'm not a litigious person, but I would be going after the owner (and their insurance company) for mental anguish.  People sue for a whole lot less in this country and get hefty compensation.  She is going to need therapy for a LONG time.",

I'm sure it was traumatic and I'm sure your friend can use counseling.  \n\nIn general it is unlikely she is going to win that kind of award in these circumstances.  But certainly she can consult an attorney and see if there is something pushing that button here. \n\n&gt;People sue for a whole lot less in this country and get hefty compensation.\n\nI don't really agree with this statement, though I know it is the perception.",

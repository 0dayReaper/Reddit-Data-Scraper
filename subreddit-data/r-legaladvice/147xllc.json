    "postText": "On May 13th, I noticed that my mailbox had been severely damaged, it appears to have had the crossbeam lifted with enough force to literally split the 4x4 it was attached to. Since I usually put my trashcans somewhat close to the mailbox (about 3 feet away), it seemed fairly likely that a garbage truck caused the damage. I've been emailing the customer service manager since the 13th. He claimed there were videos that didn't show that the garbage truck was responsible for any damage, which I asked to see to verify for myself. After two weeks of him simply not responding, he finally responded after I threatened to go up the chain and sent me the videos from inside and outside the garbage truck for the time in question. Despite his claim that \"our video does not show either if the driver did do the damage or not,\" you can see the trash bin/arm hit something and shake, the edge of the mailbox comes into view (because it's clearly being lifted), the driver curse and get out of the truck to inspect \"something\" out of frame for about a minute, before getting back in the truck and continuing on. No note was left, which as far as I can tell, is a hit and run in Nebraska.\n\nSo I put together an email, but I want to make sure it's legal and wouldn't come back to bite me for extorting them or something due to bad wording.\n\n&gt;Based on that evidence, I strongly believe your company needs to offer to pay to repair the damage, or I will be forced take the matter to small claims court. As that's a hassle none of us need, I would much prefer the former.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just to be clear, I believe this is technically a hit and run in Nebraska, as the driver was legally obligated to leave a note with their information (name, address, telephone number, and operator's license number) in a conspicuous place. As of right now, I don't believe I will file a police report, but your drivers need to be aware of what they're supposed to do in this kind of situation. I should not have had to track down evidence to figure out what happened and remedy the damage.\n\nIs that all okay? Is there anything I need to add or should definitely take out/reword?",

I don't see any reason to think their position will change on the basis of your letter.  And it seems like you're short of establishing in small claims that your account of these events is more likely true than the sum of all other possibilities.  But of course you have the legal right to try.",

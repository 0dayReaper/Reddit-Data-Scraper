    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI signed a one year lease on December 2021. In December 2022, I didn't want to re-sign the lease, so I called my management company and let them know that I wouldn't be resigning. I moved out before the move out day and didn't think anything of it.\n\nLast week, I got a notification in the mail that I was being sued for thousands of dollars of unpaid rent for the past 6 months because the management company thought that I was still living in my former apartment, though I never re-signed a lease for another year. There is also a stipulation in my former lease that the contract ends on December 2022 when I moved out.\n\nThe problem is that all of the move out correspondence (i.e. notifying the management company that I wasn't resigning the lease) took place over the phone, so there isn't a paper trail. I did return the keys (though have no \"proof\" of this) and I did ask via email for my security deposit back, though they never responded to my email.\n\nHow should I go about this? Should I talk directly to the management company and settle outside of court? Should I hire a lawyer or try to represent myself? I've normally done this whenever I've moved out of an apartment \u2013 i.e. notified the landlord directly \u2013\u00a0and have not needed a receipt or some sort of \"proof\" that I was moving out?\n\nI don't understand how they could sue for six months of rent? Shouldn't they have emailed/mailed me before it got to this? If we did go to court, what are the chances that the landlord would win?\n\nPlease help! I really don't have the funds to pay this :(",

            "comment": "You need to read your lease. Any lease I\u2019ve ever had notification needed to be done in writing and was usually spelled out in the lease on who to send it to and when. Never a good idea to do it verbally. Did you turn in keys? Send a forwarding address for security deposit?",

There might be an argument that, whatever they misunderstood, they should have known that you moved out by that date.\n\nThis is a strange one.",

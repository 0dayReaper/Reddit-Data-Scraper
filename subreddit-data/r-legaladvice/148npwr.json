    "postText": "I recently moved into a second floor duplex in the state of Texas. Pretty early into my tenancy, I invited some friends over. One of these friends asked if they could smoke a cigarette on my staircase, which is made of very flammable cedar, and since my lease stated no smoking on the property, I refused. On their way out, they lit a cigarette. I asked them to put it out and then went to bed. I later woke up to the smell of smoke, and when I went outside I realized the railing on my staircase was on fire. It must have been a stray ember from my friend's cigarette. I put it out, and immediately alerted my landlord of the situation, offering to pay for damages. She was understanding but later ceased communication with me about repairs. It has now been over a month, and I have gently inquired about the status of repairs. She informed me that they are very busy but at some point plan on replacing the entire staircase with one made of steel. I don't think they will make me pay for the entire staircase to be replaced, as the fire caused no structural damage, and only about 7 railing posts out of 60 need to be replaced. But, I am growing concerned about the safety of the damaged railing. There were two close calls, one with a friend and another with a delivery driver, who both leaned on the railing and almost fell from the second story onto the area where gardening tools are openly stored. I desperately want to avoid any injuries or worse, but since the damage is technically my fault, I am unsure how to approach the siutation. Normally, if there are urgent repairs, I would withhold rent until the repairs are made, but I don't think I can do that in this siutation. Plus, if someone is injured, I don't know who is liable, me or my landlord. Does anyone have any advice? I can try to fix it myself, but I don't think I am able to do that in Texas without my landlord's permission.",

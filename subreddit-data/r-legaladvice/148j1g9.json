    "postText": "My lease is up end of October. I\u2019ve lived here for 5 years with no issues. My building is about 50-70ft from a railroad track where for the first 4.5 years one single homeless man lived with his best friend. Back in October I watched this man die he was hit by a car in front of my apartment and I watched it happen. 3 weeks later his friend was found dead on the train tracks where another homeless person rumors that he was pushed onto the tracks by another homeless person because they wanted his tent and items we found his body because the smell got so bad. Fast forward to recently (past 3 or so months) we now have about 12-14 homeless people living within a 100 ft radius of our building, they come on our property often look in our cars and go thru our garbage. Recently they even threw out their garbage into our garbage and their stuff was infested with cockroaches which quickly made their way into our unit. I let my landlord know right away as well as let him know I no longer felt safe here due to multiple reasons and told him I\u2019d like to work something out to break my lease early. He ignored that part and only responded with \u201cI\u2019ll have an exterminator come by tomorrow to spray the place\u201d which did happen however he only paid for the exterminator to spray my kitchen and bathroom no other rooms because \u201cyou only saw the roaches in those 2 rooms so that\u2019s all that needs to be sprayed\u201d (I think otherwise but whatever) that was yesterday fast forward to today I get a text from him saying all the complaints me and my neighbor have been bringing up is too much for him and his wife so they are coming by tomorrow to take pictures to put the building on the market. I asked him if I can break my lease again and he said if I want to do so he can sue me for the remaining months of rent (as listed in my lease) but that he doesn\u2019t recommend it. \n\n\nAm I able to get out of my lease early for safety concerns?? I understand my lease states I need to pay remaining months but I really can not live here anymore \n\nThis is in Connecticut by the way if that makes a difference",

The homeless people are also the source of the roaches and the exterminator told him that and his response was just \u201cI\u2019m not talking to those homeless people they make me uncomfortable\u201d. I was also under the impression it was his problem to get rid of roaches but he only wanted to pay to have 2 rooms spray instead of the 6 rooms in the whole place he told me \u201cif you want the rest of the place sprayed you can certainly pay him to do that out of your own pocket.",

    "postText": "My (19f) dad passed away in 2019. He left my sister and I a decent amount of life insurance. We decided to buy a car for me with that money because my dad always wanted to buy my first car. I was a minor at the time, so the car had to be put in my mother\u2019s name, and also to have lower insurance. Fast forward, my mother has made several threats about selling the car and claiming it\u2019s hers because it\u2019s in her name. And that is true. However, the car was bought with my money given to me. It was paid in cash though, so there\u2019s no debit card statement. I want to get the car in my name, but my mother isn\u2019t so willing to do it. In my eyes, my father bought the car for me, and it is rightfully mine. Now legally, I know that doesn\u2019t hold much. Is there anyway I can get the car put in my name that my mother has to abide by?",

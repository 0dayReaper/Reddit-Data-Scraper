    "postText": "I\u2019m 23 and have been living away from my mother since I was 18. She has sent police to my house / school / work multiple times over the past 5 years. The only reason she does this is because I don\u2019t reply to text messages quickly enough (I\u2019m talking 30 minutes and she\u2019s panicking and sending police to find me). I have been very explicit in telling her to not do this. I have set up a rule where she must give me 48 hours to reply. I recently increased this to a week. She has ignored all of this and instead threatened to file a missing person report if I didn\u2019t reply. Literally 2 days ago she moved within 8 minutes of me when I said I didn\u2019t want her living that close. \n\nI feel harassed and frightened in my own home. I am done trying to work this out with her. Is there any legal recourse I can take?\n\nEdit: Forgot to say I\u2019m in TX",

Usually by couples separating, people divorcing, people going through ugly custody battles, or people with mental health issues.  I\u2019ve personally dealt with this many times professionally.  We have the ability to put comments in our computer system that are linked to someone\u2019s name that says if somebody calls in a welfare check on a particular person , it requires supervisor approval. This is usually done when we recognize that welfare checks are being used to harass or used in a way they were not intended. Just my two cents.",

Hopefully the agency is large enough to have a CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system to log the warning.

There are times that we simply call the person that the welfare check is supposed to be on rather than go to their house. There are times that we don't contact them at all.

Take these and text messages to create clear documentation to use in the future if needed.  Continue adding to this as things happen; it's easier than collecting evidence at the time then later.  I'd also have a chat with the police and see if they can flag it in their system.\n\n2. Decide what boundaries and relationship YOU want.  If you never want to see her again, that's fine.  Consider moving and not telling her where.  If you want a close relationship, that's fine too, as long as you are aware she may not be able to give you what you need emotionally.  Ask her to consider therapy.  Whatever boundaries you set, stick to them with no exceptions, regardless of what she does.\n\n3. Communicate your boundaries with her one more time, clearly, but this time tell her what the consequences will be of her continuing to harass you.  Tell her it makes you not want to be around her.  Ignore the guilt tripping that follow and then give her some time to cool off.\n\n4. If she continues, take the course of action that feels right to you.  If one thing doesn't work, try something else.  These would be blocking her number (you can unblock after a period of time,) moving with no forwarding address, send her a cease and desist letter, and filing for a restraining order if her actions qualify in your area for example.  She may escalate before she stops.\n\nAny time the police show up, pull out your binder to show them the previous wellness checks, you asking her to stop, and her telling you that she is going to do it if you don't reply.\n\nGood luck!",

You've asked nicely and given her plenty of opportunity to do this the civil way, it's obvious your mother does not and most likely will not ever respect your wishes. I'd do as others have suggested and go talk with the police. Don't let her bully/guilt you into doing what you don't want - as an adult, you no longer need her permission/consent. Good luck!",

She has sent police to my house / school / work multiple times over the past 5 years. The only reason she does this is because I don\u2019t reply to text messages quickly enough (I\u2019m talking 30 minutes and she\u2019s panicking and sending police to find me). I have been very explicit in telling her to not do this. I have set up a rule where she must give me 48 hours to reply. I recently increased this to a week. She has ignored all of this and instead threatened to file a missing person report if I didn\u2019t reply. Literally 2 days ago she moved within 8 minutes of me when I said I didn\u2019t want her living that close. \n&gt; \n&gt; I feel harassed and frightened in my own home. I am done trying to work this out with her. Is there any legal recourse I can take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.99859 83/379ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) | &gt;!QVp1bDJhZ1VtWQ!&lt;",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.99859 83/379ths | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot) | &gt;!QVp1bDJhZ1VtWQ!&lt;",

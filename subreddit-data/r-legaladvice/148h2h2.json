    "postText": "The company I work for recently went bankrupt 2 weeks ago and the employees including me haven\u2019t received our final  paychecks yet. Our boss just randomly texted us out of nowhere that effective immediately the company is closing all locations. We haven\u2019t gotten any prior notice at all. And despite many questions, our boss just ignores them. We\u2019re all just broke college students and really need that paycheck. I know we need to file a claim but whats our best option?",

You could sue in small claims, but even if you get a judgment, you\u2019re still standing in line with the other creditors. You can\u2019t get blood from a stone, sorry.",

So you'd want to speak with a civil attorney.",

The DA probably believes that the only way to win this case is for the five-year-old to testify. (Is that the age? Not sure where I got that. If not, what is the age?) If a judge will even allow it. And that the physical evidence isn't enough for a jury to convict. DAs love putting people who harm children into prison. If they aren't prosecuting, there's probably no confidence in a conviction given evidentiary standards etc. Is that what's going on?",

As another commenter said above, they will sometimes step in when corrupt or otherwise inactive local police won't.  But also, if the criminal conduct spans two counties, the state police can handle the investigation better.\n\nAlso, contact a \"child advocacy center.\"  I put that in quotes because I don't know what jurisdiction you're in, but they're mostly called something like that.  Multidisciplinary teams that are skilled in interviewing child victims, working with police investigators familiar with this type of case.  \n\nI don't know what \"no filed\" means.  Seems like one of two possibilities.  First, the police didn't think there was enough evidence to file in the first place, or prosecution was impossible because of a statute of limitations.*   Or, if it was actually \"no billed\" that might mean the DA *did* try to prosecute it, and the grand jury found there wasn't enough evidence.  If that's the case, the DA can no longer prosecute and the defendant won't go to jail.\n\nGoing to the child advocacy center can help you figure all this out.\n\n*This can get complicated with this type of crime and depends on jurisdiction.",

It goes the the DA and if he declines to prosecute on legal (not policy) grounds, you can go to court and compel the DA to prosecute. The state assumes liability for the prosecution.\n\nIn Florida there is a similar procedure where you can act as a Private Attorney General. I'm not nearly as familiar with this procedure as I am PA's.",

    "postText": "\nHere is a question about a circumstance where a Trust settlement agreement states that the trustee will make a final disbursement within 14 days of receipt of a Trust Beneficiary\u2019s signed quit claims and paperwork stating Beneficiary has received FULL disbursement (which only happens AFTER Trustee receives those documents).\n\nTLDR: Trustee wants me to sign quit claims for the land in the trust and paperwork stating I have received full disbursement, in order to actually receive the disbursement payout. My lawyer says to sign and return the paperwork and Settlement Agreement. But signing that I received payment before I\u2019ve actually received it, seems like I\u2019m signing my right to disbursement away if the trustee doesn\u2019t feel like honoring the Settlement Agreement.\n\nWhat happens if the Trustee does not make Settlement Agreement disbursements?\n\nIs there any way to ensure before submitting signed quit claims and other documents that Trustee will absolutely honor the Settlement Agreement?",

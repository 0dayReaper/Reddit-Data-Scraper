    "postText": "I have been following Instagram fitness coaches for years. On a bad day of desperation I agreed to video call with a coach that has been messaging me to sign up with her for about a year. The entire time I wanted to ha g up, I had a gut feeling I shouldn't continue to conversation but I felt very pressured into it. She made me sign a contract, locking me into paying monthly for 18 months. Claimed that I was getting a special deal and getting six months free. I shouldn't have signed it, I knew I couldn't afford it and care for my family. I just wanted to loose weight and be healthy and felt that with a coach I would finally be successful. I tried to get out of it before I even had a payment taken out or recieved my plan but she said, \" I wish I could help you. You have a few days to figure it out\" I felt trapped and gave in. I have no money. Like negative money. I have sent her multiple messages explaining my situation, gave her copies of my bank accounts ( account numbers edited out of course) just to prove to her I wasn't lying. This girl is based on Instagram out of the states and I am in Canada. The contract basically says its binding unless I die or become permanently disabled. I'm an idiot, I should have listened to my gut and now I'm stuck and I need advice. She won't answer any of my messages but I can see she's seen them. Any suggestions on how I can get out of this?!",

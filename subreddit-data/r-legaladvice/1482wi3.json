    "postText": "I just went for my last tattoo laser removal that I have already paid for. Prior to this there was no indication that there was a new owner and we agreed on an appointment today at 11am. I get there and its a different lady &amp; she proceeds to tell me that she won't be doing the lasering even though I have already paid for it. Is this legal \u300a ? \u300b I'm in New Zealand. I lost my cool with her because she was saying that she has no obligation to do the lasering even though I've already paid for it.",

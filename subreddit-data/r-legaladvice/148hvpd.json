    "postText": "So back in December of 2022 (the week before Christmas) i was laid off from my job and was not able to pay rent. So i filed for rental assistance (CHAP) in February. I got a job mid/late February and didn\u2019t start getting paid until March so i was very low on money and whenever i did get paid it was going to my car, phone, and  credit card bills so I\u2019m pretty much living pay check to pay and still unable to pay my rent. \n\nSo CHAP didn\u2019t reply to my application until last week and when i talked with them they said i was denied because i had gotten rental assistance the year prior. So now i don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m freaking out because i do not want this huge debt on top of everything else that i have and I\u2019m scared of getting evicted and not having no place to go i need help is there anything i Can do to fight back to get the assistance?",

    "postText": "I have leased a storage unit from Public Storage in a different state for about 3 years' time now. I initially got the storage unit as temporary storage when I moved since I wasn't able to move all my goods across the country, with the intention of going back to clear things out and cancel my lease within a few months. Things changed, COVID happened, and I never went back to clear it out. So I continued making the monthly payments just to keep stuff sitting there.\n\nI am now at a point where I no longer can afford the monthly payment and was wondering what the repercussions would be (if any) if I just stop making the payment? Do I really need to book a flight, hotel, and U-Haul in the state where my storage unit is just to clear it out? What happens if I just stop making payments? I don't mind if they just liquidate/donate my items, what I am more worried about is a hit on my credit or sending my lease to collections if I stop paying. ",

Sometimes they'll dispose of your items for a fee. \n\nIf you stop making payments they'll send your bill to collections which will show up on your credit. \n\nOtherwise you can find someone on taskrabbit type sites to empty out your unit for a price.",

They may assess a cleanout fee.  (Your lease should include details for all of these.)  \n\nObviously, don't just **stop** paying.",

I have called them and they say I have to come clean it out. But I'm wondering if there's any way to get rid of it without having to travel there and without incurring some sort of penalty.",

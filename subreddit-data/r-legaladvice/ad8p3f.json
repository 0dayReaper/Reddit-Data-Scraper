    "postText": "Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened \n\nTitle says it all. We\u2019ve been married for 3 years now. She\u2019s always been one for quirky, \u201cagainst-the-grain\u201d thinking and interests. However, it\u2019s not just harmless things like believing there\u2019s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in \u201caesthetic poses\u201d, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there\u2019s this anti-vax bullshit. \n\nShe got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she\u2019s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. \n\nI love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She\u2019s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. \n\nI know that in her mind, she\u2019s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we\u2019ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. \n\n\u201cOh well if you look this graph you\u2019ll see that the numbers of cases for &lt;X disease&gt; have risen alongside the increased use of &lt;Y vaccine&gt;\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I\u2019m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of \u201ccorrelation doesn\u2019t equal causation.\u201d By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about ice cream and murder, we\u2019re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They\u2019re completely different!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn\u2019t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with \u201cThose statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and \u201cbig-pharma\u201d\n\nShe won\u2019t budge and hasn\u2019t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I\u2019m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could\u2019ve been easily avoided. \n\nI am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife\u2019s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don\u2019t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. \n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

Vaccinations are mandatory for school here (barring a religious or medical waiver) and schools will check the digital shot record database (and *only* the digital shot record database, as I found out when I moved here with a sealed copy of my children's vaccination records.)  So it is quite possible that, even if you avoid any other trace of the vaccines (paying in cash at a local pharmacy and hiding the band-aids?) that she will discover they were vaccinated when she registers the child for school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, while this isn't legal advice, I would consider different techniques in addressing your wife's anti-vax beliefs.  There is a method of conversation/debate that has gained popularity in atheist circles called \"Street Epistemology\" that is useful for discussing other beliefs as well, not just religious.  It has the advantage of not being adversarial, while still getting a person to re-examine their beliefs (or more specifically, their reasons for holding them.)  You can find plenty of youtube videos on the method, and there is a subreddit as well.  Good luck!",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

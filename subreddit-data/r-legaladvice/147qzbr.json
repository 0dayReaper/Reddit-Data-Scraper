    "postText": "For context im located in Quebec, Canada, main languages are French an English, or supposed to be anyway.\n\nSo I went to the dmv (not the name but basically same thing) to get some stuff renewed an to exchange the disability form I had been sent (it was in french) for one that I could actually understand. \n\nWhen i ask for an english copy they tell me they dont have any, that the form is french only. This is an aplication for disability, it's a medical form, Canada is a bilingual country and they don't have an English form???\n\nThis isn't the first time I've had a problem with stuff like this, usually it's small stuff, french only signs for stores\n-card machine not working cash only- \nNo English translation on an answering machine\n-was attempting to contact a government service/chain store-\njust a few months ago my local grocery store got into legal trouble for discrimination agains English job applicants.\n\nAll that I can put up with an I have. But this is a MEDICAL FORM that isn't avaliable in one of the two main languages of the entire country. \n\nLaw isn't my thing but there's no way this isn't discrimatory, right?\n\nWhat I want to know is if there is any way to fix this so that at least medical forms are required to be avaliable in both french and English.",

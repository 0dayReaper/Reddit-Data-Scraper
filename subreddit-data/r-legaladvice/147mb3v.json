    "postText": "My boyfriend quit his job as a correctional officer for the state of NC at the end of april. According to the payroll person at the prison he was at, he should have been paid out his vacation time at the next payday (may 31st) but she \u201cisnt sure what happened because shes been really busy\u201d, then claimed she couldn\u2019t do anything but try to get it paid out at the next scheduled payday (june 30th) \n\nMy boyfriend then contacted someone in Raleigh who said he would look into it. We\u2019ve called him every weekday for two weeks and havent even gotten a response. He also said he couldn\u2019t get it paid out until june 30th.\n\nThat vacation payout was supposed to pay our rent this month. We\u2019re past due on half our bills and dont know what to do from here.",

            "comment": "I'm not a lawyer, but I am an employee of the state of NC, but not in corrections. \n\nMy understanding is that for many jobs (but not all, so I could be mistaken) the state paychecks are for the preceeding month/pay period, not the month/pay period that just past, if that makes sense. So when he got paid at the end of April, that check was for the time worked in March. \n\nIf this is correct 1) he should've gotten his pay for April at the end of May and 2) when he started the job, he had to wait until the end of the 2nd month he worked to receive his 1st paycheck. If those statements are correct, his vacation payout won't process until the month *after* his final paycheck which would indeed be thr end of June.\n\nIf that's not correct for him and he's one of those that *does* get paid directly for the preceeding month, it seems something is amiss or not been done. Keep calling the HR guy. On the whole, the state of NC's HR is down ~30% of staff (like many state departments and agencies) so shit is taking for.ev.er to process. Like, I recently changed agencies and am currently in the process of having my years of service verified and it's been 2 months!! I know that doesn't help a lot but just wanted to say that it's likely not a him problem and is a them issue.",

But then we didn\u2019t get a paycheck at the end of may (which would have been his pay for april) \n\nWhen we called they told us that the base pay for each month is paid out for the month just past, and then any overtime is put onto the next month like you described. So aprils pay gets paid out in april, then aprils overtime gets paid out in may. Then they told us that he had some overtime from\nApril, but it all got eaten up in taxes (which also doesn\u2019t make sense to me because im like 85% sure thats not how taxes work? But i could be wrong) \n\nAnd then payroll told us that the vacation pay should have paid out in may but that someone forgot to sign a peice of paperwork so they cant send it out to us before the end of june.",

It's terribly shitty that because a single paper wasn't signed, his payout was delayed. Unfortunately that's not unusual for stuff with the state but sucks all around. I'm not sure there's anything you can do legally or otherwise to get the check faster tho. However, if it doesn't appear on June 30th, maybe there's a way to escalate?",

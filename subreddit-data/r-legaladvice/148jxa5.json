    "postText": "Hello, my ex left the state (CO) and went to Arizona after I caught her cheating for the second time. She took the ring. I would have to file a lawsuit against her in Arizona (where the ring would 100% be mine) if I wanted it back. However, her parents have a lot of money. Im afraid that they could counter-Sue in Arizona rather than my state and getting back the ~$13k engagement ring might not be worth it. What are the possible outcomes, in terms of recourse, should I try to get my ring back? If she countersues, could I try to have that moved to my state? Could there possibly be a better avenue? Thank you much in advance.",

Im afraid that they could counter-Sue in Arizona rather than my state \n\nIsn't this already going to take place in Arizona?  This would be one case, with the ownership of the ring up for dispute. There's not a separate counterclaim to be made, and certainly not one by her parents. \n\nYour biggest issue is that the small claims max in AZ is $3500.  You'll need to file in superior court since you're over $10k. You're going to want a lawyer.",

Does that change which court I can file in?\n\nI also heard of issues with collecting anything the court awards (be it the physical ring or monetary value). \n\nHer parents were paying for the wedding and have said they blame me for any monetary losses incurred. If I get sued it would be for something along those lines I would imagine. Her dad thoroughly enjoys suing people - typically he finds a reason to sue someone once every year or two.",

Not sure in AZ, but there are occasionally circumstances where it's an either/or (value or the item itself).\n\nCorrect; a judgment does not mean the court hands you a check; you would need to collect.\n\n&gt; Her parents were paying for the wedding and have said they blame me for any monetary losses incurred\n\nThen that is a separate case, and would vary by state on how the situation may be interpreted, including any responsibility or implied liability.  Obviously, that would require mitigation of damages (so, maybe a deposit, not the full amount).",

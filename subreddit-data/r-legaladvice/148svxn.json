    "postText": "In Texas. Broke ground the first week of July, 2022. Set back and delays are constant. We finally, just today, had the guy come out to show us how to use the panel and equipment to run the thing. There's been a slow leak since we first filled the pool after plastering, which we were told was probably because of a bad valve on the equipment, they changed some stuff, etc.\n\nThey changed a valve. Said they still have to come out and change something else on the equipment. Still leaks.\n\nThen the guy hooked up the Polaris pool vacuum thing. Right away we had water seeping out from the masonry itself (part of the pool is a retaining wall because of the sloped yard). I mean, the water is spurting in one section, and leaking from multiple spots now that actual water pressure had been placed on the pipes there. These pipes are literally buried inside the structure of the pool.\n\nThey've got someone coming out first thing tomorrow morning. I have no doubt that they will fix it and make it right. BUT I AM JUST DONE with this shit. I don't want much, but I do want compensation for loss of enjoyment or whatever they call that. At a minimum, I want extended warranties that will be in effect for 3 years (they only do 1 year on plumbing right now) and I want them to pay to refill the pool. If I can, I'd like the last $5k check I wrote them to be torn up.\n\nIf it came down to it and they refused these requests, would suing them be a real option?",

    "postText": "This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair\n\nI have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.\n\nAt 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop \"he is there, what is going on!?\" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.\n\n The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.\n\nHe asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...\n\nSo now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.\n\nI have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the \"detonatios\" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.\n\nIs the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.\n\nLocation: Puerto Rico",

If the cops obtained a valid warrant, there should be a \"narrative\" report section where the responding officer will have described their warrant application to the warrant judge. ",

That sounds like something made up to justify breaking in to your home. I would get a police report and see if statements by the officer(s) who heard the noises explain that at all. It might be hard to disprove that they did hear something from inside, but personally I would consider suing over that. They can't just make crap up and break into your house with it.\n\nThen again, you might consider this an instance where officers fudged some facts a little to make sure a child wasn't in danger, and let it go.",

Unable to do so, they finally forced entry to make sure the child was okay.\n\nThat's completely fine.\n\nIt's also unlikely that it took them an hour from the time of the call to show up.  The time is likely less than ten minutes.\n\nI don't see anything improper on the part of the police based on your story.\n",

You have a call made by someone who isn't just a noisy neighbor, its a security guard who presumably doesn't call for every baby who is crying. Moreover, you have long repeated attempts to make contact with the resident of a unit where a child who is in danger is believed to have been. I'm among the last to believe there are exigent circumstances to allow a warrantless entry, and I do question it somewhat in this case based on the fact that the kid was apparently asleep at the time they entered the house, so presumably the officers never heard the kid. However, the kid could have been hurt to the point of not being able to respond and/or CO poisoning could have taken effect knocking out everyone. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, this seems reasonable to me, in fact, the biggest flag I have here is that they didn't enter SOONER.",

You realize there are security jobs, especially in Puerto Rico, that are basically entry level jobs, anyone can get.  They don't always require background checks.  They don't require any additional training.  How would you feel if police wouldn't listen to you, instead insisting that the 17 year old security guard on his second day on the job is more reliable than you, simply to due to his profession.  That's absurd.  Security guards are not police, and the idea that their statements are more valuable than someone else's is going to need some sources besides a blase assertion.  ",

If a regular person would have called this in or a neighbor the police response would likely be the same.\n\nHe only mentions the person being a security guard because its likely that they hear babies crying in other house while working. They don't call the police for every time they hear one so it would be reasonable for the police to assume this is an unordinary circumstance. Same situation if OPs neighbor would have called in the complaint. It would be reasonable to assume a neighbor has heard OPs kid cry numerous times in the past and hasn't called police. So the police would assume that the neighbor calling means this is an unusual circumstance.\n\nNow lets say OP finds out this security guard has a habit of doing this for every crying child they hear on duty. This might be enough to go after the security guard for a false police report / civil damages.\n\n",

He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.\n&gt; \n&gt; At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop \"he is there, what is going on!?\" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.\n&gt; \n&gt; He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption. The ves me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops left I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked myson if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. Thecops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the \"detonatios\" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.2836 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

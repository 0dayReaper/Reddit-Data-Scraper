    "postText": "Hi! Recently my landlord wanted to charge me 50 for every month I was late on rent. I was late on Nov, Dec,Jan, feb, March and April. On the lease agreement she stated that it's 20/day that the money is late. See the issue with this is, she made us write the checks and date them for every month on the first before we even moved in. She also charged us (my 6room mates and I) 2 months rent for a down deposit. \n\nI was a bit confused with the 20/day thing because checks usually need to be processed and I usually HAD the money (specifically for april and feb) the day after but she would wait a few days to actually put the check in the bank after it bounced. Another thing is that she would charge me if the check bounced. \n\nFor December-November I asked if it was okay for me to pay rent late because she my father was sick and she agreed and she asked what day I should deposit. I would state the day and she said that's okay. (It's in writing) \n Also, I live in nyc if that helps anything. \n\nI'm just a bit peeved because I looked up some tenant rights and I'm still confused on some parts. Would appreciate if I could get any advice bcos I'm a college student n srsly broke. I feel like a lot of what she's doing is illegal/scamming me. Thanks for anything!",

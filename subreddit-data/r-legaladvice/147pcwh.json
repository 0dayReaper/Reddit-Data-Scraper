    "postText": "A few hours ago myself and my partner were notified that his sister has died of self-inflicted injury. She leaves behind three children: 14, 13, and 10. She was the sole legal guardian because their biological father passed away for the same reason approximately 5 years ago. It may be important to note that I am not married to my partner; however we have been together for 9 years and I have an established relationship with all three children. My partner is the biological uncle of the children.\n\nWe are currently in the process of figuring out what happened. I\u2019m not sure if the children even know about their mother yet. We would like to apply for what I assume would be emergency guardianship of all three children. We personally believe the remaining immediate family members would be unfit to provide care. We assume there is no will naming guardianship for the children.\n\nWhat steps do we need to take to nominate ourselves as emergency guardians? Located in Pennsylvania, US.",

Custody/guardianship doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be determined right this instant, someone can voluntarily take care of the kids until then\n\nIf there\u2019s a lot of people fighting over their custody, that does get messier\n\n&gt;\t It may be important to note that I am not married to my partner; however we have been together for 9 years and I have an established relationship with all three children\n\nYeah, it may be easier for your partner to get guardianship on his own\n\n&gt;\tWe assume there is no will naming guardianship for the children.\n\nWouldn\u2019t necessarily matter, court still decides what is in the best interests of the children\n\nIf the parent\u2019s wishes specify something, that will be considered, but the court has final say",

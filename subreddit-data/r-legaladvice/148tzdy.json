    "postText": "Long story short... Bought a new 2023 accord for 34k in march... Was driving it home from dealer.. 15 mins down the road this teenage kid on cell phone sideswiped my new car from back to front with 23 miles on it causing 5k in damage.  She was ticketed and her insurance (state farm) went with police report.  SF paid for repairs... Took 2 months.. SF paid for rental car for most of that time.  \n\nI filed for diminished value and SF said get a quote from a dealer... I got a quote and local Honda dealer said 26400. This is trade in...bc that's what I would be paid..  State farm hired an independent appraiser named pinnacle who said my DV is only 1740...  They didn't even look at the car (yet it says right on their website that all good appraisals should be done in person, lol)  SF Agent said they will stick with their experts numbers when I commented that 1740 is a long ways away from 34k minus 26.4= $7600.   (Yes I realize cars depreciate the minute you buy them but this was 23 miles and 15 minutes later)\n\nAnyone with knowledge or experience dealing with a DV claim have success negotiating the initial offer up?  I've had success with property claims and total loss claims but I've never had an agent indicate that their initial offer is the essentially firm but I've never tackled a DV...  I'm wondering what other info I could get without laying out $350 a pop for formula driven appraisals that don't even look at the car that would help bolster my negotiations..   I've done one free formula driven estimate called tigerdv and they quoted 6500...I spoke to a lawyer and I'm not sure I want to deal with this for 18 months but they tentatively accepted the case which means they feel there's more money in it although it's preliminary so I don't have numbers...  I'm not real interested in small claims either.  I'd really like to hit the insurance with some irrefutable data but want to see if anyone else has been successful on their own just against insurance..if state farm even better...thanks for any help.",

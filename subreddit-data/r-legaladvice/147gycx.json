    "postText": "To preference this I\u2019m only 20 and don\u2019t know anything about the laws of labor when it comes to tips so please be considerate about my question. I work at a job in Texas for $7.50 an hour where we also earn tips that are split but my boss takes the majority of them. On average we all together in total make around $5k a month in tips all which my boss keeps most and only returns to each one of us (less than 10 employees) around $100-$160 back at the end of the month. Was wondering if this is allowed? I\u2019m tired of seeing my tips taken away when I earned them",

            "comment": "NAL, but this comes up often. \n\nIt is completely illegal for your employer to take your tips anywhere in the USA. It is also illegal in Texas for managers or owners to take part in top pools. So what he's doing is a big huge NO. \n\nYou can contact the owner, corporate (if a franchise); this is not a legal mess they should want. Prepare for them to find a reason to fire you, but if you are fired in blatant retaliation for it, come back for advice on that, too. You can also contact the state board of labor. If you're still at a loss of what to do, get a consultation with a labor lawyer for help. (An initial consultation can be cheap or free, or you and your coworkers can pitch in for it.)\n\nAlso, carefully go over your paycheck stubs and make sure you aren't being taxed on the full tip amount you *should* be getting.",

I assume it wouldn't be anything they would take on, but make sure to ask what you can do to make it as uncomfortable as possible and create an official government record. \n\nNo one ever remembers Wage &amp; Hour, and fewer actually report. Expect to get fired or pushed out. Make sure you ask the attorney if he wants to be made aware if you're retaliated against. \n\nSounds like it's time to go anyway.",

You'll need to file a wage theft claim with the DoL. You'll want to have documented proof. He owes all of you.

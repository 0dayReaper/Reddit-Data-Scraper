    "postText": "Greetings,\n\nTLDR: I got dinged for violating the basic speed law (257627(1)) with a note that says \"78 in a 40\". Please see questions 1 and 2 below, but help with any other questions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other night I was making a quick trip to the local market to pick up some last minute supplies for a party the next day. It was after 10 PM, so quite dark out. This stretch of road is wide open with a speed limit of 40, but people (myself included) usually drive around 50.\n\nI noticed a pair of headlights in the distance, and it felt like they were driving quite fast, much faster than me, so adrenaline kicked in I guess. I increased my speed as\n\n1. I didn't want to get rear ended by some crazy\n2. I had no idea if this car was trying to catch/follow me (there's some crazies out here)\n\nI knew there was a local police station just up the road, so it was a safe target to reach, then pull over and make sure the other guy kept on driving. Who says life doesn't have a sense of humor?\n\nWell, the other guy was a cop....eventually he got tired of trying to catch me and just turned on his lights, so I pulled over. He kept insisting he had no idea how fast I was going but \"he was doing 78 and couldn't catch me\". He also accused me of rolling through a 4 way stop a mile back, which is how I got his attention in the first place.\n\nIn the end, I got a ticket for violating the basic speed law (257627(1)) and it states \"78 in a 40\"\n\nI've got a few questions for the community if I may..\n\n1. In reading up on the Basic Speed Law, it seems like something impossible to fight as the cop can simply say \"I think he was going too fast for the conditions\", is there any hope here?\n2. Does the speed (78 in a 40) matter for such a ticket? I know if it was a normal speeding ticket, there's various points/fines based on how fast you were going over the posted speed limit, but I don't know if that applies to a \"Basic Speed Law\" violation?\n3. One of my primary concerns is the distance this car was from me (he was a ways back, just a pair of headlights) is there's no way he could accurately gauge if he was closing in on me or not. I've read that pacing is often ineffective at night, especially when the distance is large. While the ticket was not a pacing ticket (again, basic speed law violation) it seems an easy argument to make that there's no way he could reliably judge his distance to me well enough to say if he was catching up or not.\n4. I understand this isn't really entrapment, but had he not been driving so fast to catch me in the first place, I never would have sped up. I've passed police officers multiple times on this stretch of road going 50 in a 40, and none of them bat an eye. I get it's not a legal excuse, but he did cause me to speed up. I don't suppose this is an argument I can make?\n5. I absolutely plan on fighting this, but I've read a wildly varying amount of misinformation out there, and previous experience has shown me that court dates are often \"informal\" with just the officer and a judge. How can I ensure I am properly requesting a formal trial where I can question the cop and examine his evidence, camera footage, calibration logs etc?\n6. Where can I find the various rules/laws for Michigan (or the township I'm in) that dictate how often vehicles must be calibrated etc?\n\nI'm sure there's a lot of people rolling their eyes, and I would be too, so I get it. I'd be happy to pay the 50 in a 40, but there's simply no way I was going 70+ (or at least I wouldn't have been if he didn't cause it).",

            "comment": "What you\u2019d be happy to pay doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nBasic speed law means the cop believes you were driving at unsafe conditions, even if you were driving below the speed limit (in this example trying to outrun the cop). \n\nThey also didn\u2019t cause you to speed up, you made a couple of assumptions and decided to floor it. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have much of a case here to fight, but by all means try.",

                    "comment": "Thanks, but to be clear, at no point did I decide to \"floor it\". My speed when his lights came on was somewhere around 55. At no point was I going anywhere close to 70, let alone the 78+ he is charging me with. \n\nMy main question here is around the basic speed law itself. It seems binary to me, either the cop thought I was going too fast or I wasn't. I don't understand if/how the amount plays a factor here. The cop admitted he had no idea how fast I was going.",

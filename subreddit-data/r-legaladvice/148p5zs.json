    "postText": "I recently bought a house in Bristol, TN.\n\nDuring the home inspection, the inspector noted possible microbial growth and recommended a mold test. The mold test came back showing elevated mold levels in two rooms. A mold remediation company provided a $6,000 quote to remove the mold from the house (but not rebuild anything).\n\nAfter some back and forth, the seller claimed that she had \u201cfour professionals\u201d who looked and said there was no mold. She refused to do any mold remediation or allow a more invasive inspection of the house.\n\nIn the end, she agreed to pay $3,000 of the remediation but would not allow it to begin until after closing. Several times she indicated that the house had no moisture and no mold issues.\n\nWe closed on June 5, and the mold remediation began on June 7. It was supposed to address two of the downstairs rooms and take two days, but it turns out the mold had reached 80% of the downstairs drywall and took 4 days to remediate.\n\nOn day 2 of the remediation, the contractor told me that there are several signs that some very poorly done mold remediation had taken place about 3 years ago (based on dates stamped on building materials). No steps were taken to prevent future mold growth; they just replaced rotted wood and painted over concrete that was leaking.\n\nBased on what the contractor said, the seller knew (or reasonably should have known) that mold was an issue and repeatedly made claims to the contrary during the sale of the house. In this case, is there any basis for seeking the assistance of a local lawyer? Or maybe a small claims suit?\n\nI\u2019ve never been inclined to sue anyone before, but it sure smells like the seller knowingly misrepresented facts for her financial benefit.",

For example, if the seller hired a reputable remediation company to do the prior repair and they conveyed to her that they had fixe the problem, she's under no obligation to tell you of it later.  She would only have an obligation if she knew or reasonably should have known that there was an **existing** mold problem.",

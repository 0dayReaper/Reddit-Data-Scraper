    "postText": "My husband's uncle wants my husband to inherit his home and land upon his passing. He wants the land to stay in his family, but both his kids will sell it. My husband is his uncle's favorite family member. What is the best way to go about this? Would it be a will? Living trust? Is there a different option? We would like it to be something not contested or easily contested due to his daughter being a vindictive and angry meth addict and this being a family home that belonged to my husband's grandparents. He is not the only grandchild. I'm not sure how contesting works, so I'm just throwing all this out here in case it's useful.\n\nHe lives in Atlanta and we will be going to visit in a couple months. His uncle can't be bothered to do any research or set any legal appointments, so we are having to do it all and we don't know the process. \n\nOnce we know what type of process we are doing, is this something that can be setup in a single meeting?  We only travel to visit twice a year and don't have time to make additional visits if this can't be accomplished in one week. \n\nI'd like to know what to pursue and how long it will take/how many sessions before contacting lawyers to schedule meetings. \n\n\nSorry for being ignorant. I know nothing of the legal world.",

            "comment": "There are a number of different ways to do it.  What works best is going to depend on the property in question as well as your husband's and his uncle's situations.\n\nThis is the sort of thing where you'd typically meet with a lawyer first to discuss options, instead of having an option picked out and then finding a lawyer.  However, most estate planning attorneys can set up any of the various options for you.\n\nIt's probably not something that can be drawn up in one meeting with a lawyer - if nothing else, the lawyer will need to figure out what the Uncle wants to do, and then actually write up all the paperwork before Uncle signs it, so at minimum two sessions.\n\nFortunately, you can do a lot of preliminary research by phone.  I presume that Uncle is actually willing to go talk to lawyers and sign  paperwork so long as you guys do all the legwork?  It's not *that* unusual to have a stubborn elderly family member like this, so if you explain to the lawyers you're talking to what the situation is, they'll be able to work with you.  They may also be able to take care of some of it remotely.",

He made it known he wants my husband to receive the property, but he doesn't want to do any of the legwork for research, the attorney, or anything. He wants us to schedule everything and pay for it in advance so he just has to show up, tell the lawyer what he wants, and sign. Thank you for your input. This is a huge undertaking for us because we have no idea what to do. I wasn't sure if this was something where everyone would be like \"only ever do a trust, don't will it\" etc or if it would really be something that would be discussed at length before deciding.",

            "comment": "The best thing the uncle can do is to go and see an estate attorney.  This is literally what they do all day.  The cost will be pocket change compared to the value of the assets and the cost of doing it wrong.\n\n&gt;Would it be a will? Living trust?\n\nAn estate plan will likely include both of these.  In order to be effective, some \"follow through\" is needed for a trust.  The property will have to be deeded to the trust and the deed recorded.  The attorney can help with that too.\n\nDo not fall into the trap of having the uncle just put your husband on the deed.  This is  generally considered to be the worst way to transfer property to heirs for a variety of reasons.",

I just didn't want to waste anyone's time if I could get some input in advance and be able to tell his uncle and a lawyer exactly what we need. I'll start contacting local estate lawyers and setting up a first appointment.",

But he has to go to the meetings, communicate what he wants, discuss the various aspects of his estate, tax planning, what the options are and then make decisions.\n\nNope, don't plan on this happening in one meeting. Presuming he has assets other than the house - all of this has to be evaluated and addressed when making an estate plan.\n\nP.S. Husband's uncle can only control so much from beyond the grave. What happens when your husband dies? Does he have an estate plan yet? What happens if your husband dies before his uncle?",

He wants us to have everything lined up so all he has to do is show up. \nThanks for your input",

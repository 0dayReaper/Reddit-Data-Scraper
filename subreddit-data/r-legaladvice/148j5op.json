    "postText": "Hello! I have an ESA letter from my doctor, which I have sent to my landlord previously. They responded back and said that we needed to fill out information about the pet/how it helps/get that form signed by my doctor as well, but through some internet research the letter should have been sufficient enough.  Do I need to send back the forms they sent me or just having evidence that I sent the letter would be enough? I'm located in Utah in the US.",

    "postText": "So... In Nebraska, though I can't find anything obvious in State law that changes this from federal, but I'm moving out of my apartment after more than five years in it. During my long time here, the carpets have sustained some damage, most notably, apartment maintenance cut into it while resolving some leaky pipe water damage (and repatched over it), and I have some pet damage where a smallish (~3in) hole was dug into a corner. I am not pretending that I am not responsible for this, and let the management know about it when I started the move-out process.\n\nThe management mentioned that they consider their carpets to have a useful life of (around) 10 years, and so would prorate based on my time for the material cost of replacement carpet, but that I'd be responsible for the full labor costs. Granted, this was not a statement by a lawyer, there was no legal documentation involved, just the management going over what they remembered happening in past such instances. I have not yet been sent a bill for this or had my security deposit deductions calculated. This is all for preemptive self-information. Obviously I don't want to pay the full replacement costs of a carpet if I can avoid it, as it would all but certainly exceed my security deposit. I also don't want to just walk away from it if it turns out I am legally responsible for that full amount, even though some people have told me to just \"ignore anything in excess of the security deposit\", which I know is not a legal position.\n\nMy googling since has implied that, for tacked-down carpet, which this carpet most certainly is, the proration period should be five years, based on IRS rulings, but while I can find that number, I can't find much in the way of alternative numbers or reasons for which this period may be exceeded. It also implied that they can only charge me based on the cost of the initial carpet, said nothing about labor being billed separately, and noted that it's based on the carpet install date, not my move-in date... And I'm 90% sure the carpet was not brand new upon my move in... Though I have no idea how long the previous tenants may have been here.\n\nSo I guess my question is... Is there likely to be a legal basis for their ten-year useful life over the IRS's 5-year carpet life? And is there a basis for charging labor separately? Is there a reason they should be able to charge for the full carpet replacement (as implied) over just patching the carpet as maintenance has done in the past? If they pursue this as they've implied they will, will I have a legal reason to fight back?",

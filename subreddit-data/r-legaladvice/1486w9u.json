    "postText": "Hello, as the title says I need help with the process concerning a restraining order in California. I've already filed and served the papers to the respondent today.   \n\n\nThe question I have is simple...Should I have a lawyer for this? I feel like I have pretty damming evidence against the respondent including a 90's police record of domestic violence and a first hand account from family that housed us at the time. Not to mention text messages from recent accounts.   \n\n\nI'm admittedly scared and want to do this right. But if I can do this without a lawyer I will. Any help is appreciated, thank you.",

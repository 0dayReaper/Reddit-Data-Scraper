    "postText": "So, last year I bought a very cheap car. Then I got sick due to psychosis and after failing to put gas in my car, and probably due to other mechanical issues I was unaware, the car stopped in the middle of the high way. My life and other people's life's were in danger, and someone called 911. I was taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with schizophrenia as well as given injections. I wasn't coherent. During my hospital stay, I was given two tickets. I wanted to pay the tickets when I recovered, but after about 20 days, I received a letter saying police got a warrant for my arrest and I can avoid getting arrested by immediately paying the fine. Which I promptly paid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family took me for a vacation and I forget about all of this. Right now, I plan on renewing my expired DL, but after requesting records, I was bewildered to see a conviction of \"Equipment Misuse\" and noncompliance suspension, and license forfeiture suspention in my record.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wonder what I can do to fix this records as they look bad to employers? and why is my DL still suspended after I paid the fines?",

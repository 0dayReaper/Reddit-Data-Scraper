    "postText": "hi, I'm hoping I could get some advice on this. \n\nI registered for a study abroad program via my local community college to visit Wyoming. I was not accepted into the Wyoming program, but I was offered a position on another program to New Mexico. Both classes were supposed to be worth three credits.\n\nIn between being rejected from the Wyoming program and offered a position on the New Mexico program, an email was sent to enrolled students about a change in the amount of credits the classes would be worth. Instead of three credits, the classes we're now going to be worth one credit. I was not in rolled at the time, therefore, I did not receive an email notification of this. \n\nI was not notified of any time during my interview process for the New Mexico program that the amount of credit for the class had changed. I was not notified at any point up until I was in New Mexico. \n\nI paid a $150 deposit for this trip, not for the class. However, I paid the deposit under the impression that I would be getting three college credits. \n\nSince I was not notified of the change at all, and I can prove it, do I have any legal standing in terms of getting my money back or anything of that nature? \n\nI'm happy to provide more context if and where needed. Thank you! Edit to add: I am back from the trip. If I had known of this change, I would not have gone on the trip to begin with.",

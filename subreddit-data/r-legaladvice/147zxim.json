    "postText": "I won't lie or beat around the bush, but when I was younger (about 14), me and my friends prank called someone from my phone, and they reported it to the police. I know it was a dumb thing to do. Anyway, the police called me shortly after and asked for my full name and told me to make sure it never happens again. They didn't ask for my DOB, or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm getting close to applying for my universities, and I'm remembering this event. I'm just a bit scared that the universities will be able to see that I prank called someone and will not offer me a space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this the case, and if so, is there anything I can do to change it (I know I should never of done it in the first place and still do regret it.) I'm from the UK if that helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can provide any advice.",

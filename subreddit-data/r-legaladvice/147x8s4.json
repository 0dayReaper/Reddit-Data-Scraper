    "postText": "So my husband was charged with 3rd degree DWI. They claim he refused a chemical test. He did a breathalyzer at the scene when he was pulled over. The \"refusal\" was a second chemical test, which he refused on the advice of an attorney that they had him choose from a list they gave him. I assume that this is why the arresting office originally said that he would be released after 12 hours. It wasn't 3rd degree anything. What questions do we need to be asking his public defender?\n\nEdit: Typo",

The PBT (the little handheld that you blow into roadside) isn't the actual chemical test, legally speaking. In most cases, PBT results aren't admissible in court. The PBT is just used to establish probable cause for a chemical test or arrest.\n\nWhat state was this in?",

OP continues to insist that because he provided a PBT sample it shouldn\u2019t be a refusal despite being told repeatedly that MN law requires the chemical test (DMT-G breath test) or it is a refusal. The PBT is irrelevant.",

The only thing that refusing a PBT means is the officer has probable cause to require a chemical test.",

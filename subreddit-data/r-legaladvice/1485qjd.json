    "postText": "My ex and I broke up a little over a year ago. We had gotten a house together and lived there together for about 2 years, but ended up breaking up for other reasons. When we broke up, I left the house and didn't think anything else about it. The police went to my mother's house today and I guess it was to serve me papers due to foreclosure on my ex house. I did sign a few papers but I was unemployed at the time of buying the house so they just used his credit and work history. I can't afford the payments or anything on my own and he had completely removed my number from any and all bills at the house so I was never informed of anything. I went by the house after the papers were served to my mother and the place looks completely abandoned, railings are missing off the porch, ac unit gone, doorknob looks like it was smashed and one of the railings off the porch is inside the house kind of holding the door closed. What should I expect from the hearing? Do I need to get a lawyer? Will I be expected to pay the damages or anything along those lines? I've been struggling financially since leaving and I don't know how to fix this situation.",

    "postText": "Man dies and leaves his estate via will and probate to his solo legal wife and single legitimate named son. Ratio 98:2. His wife then dies and bequeathes remainder of her estate via will and probate to same single legitimate named son (only). All transfers in both cases via acredited wills and legal probates under English law. Several years later illegitimate son is revealed via DNA test. No mention of illegitimate son in either will. Existence of biological link to illegitimate son unknown to legitimate son previously. Does illegitimate son have any legal claim on man's estate?",

            "comment": "Inheritance laws are jurisdiction-dependent.\n\nIn the US, the illegitimate son would have no claim due to several factors.\n\n1: Establishing someone as a legal parent is incredibly difficult, usually impossible, to do after the would-be parent's death.  It almost always requires the parent to have, in some way, acknowledged the child before their death.  \n\n2: \"Years\" is going to be outside the statute of limitations for challenging the will pretty much everywhere.  1-2 years is the normal limit.\n\n3: Even if the two above didn't count, there are few places that require you to include a child in an inheritance.  In other words, it's legal in most of the US to leave a child out of your will.",

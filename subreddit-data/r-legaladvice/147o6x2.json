    "postText": "So the tenant are new, they started last month. Right when they moved in the toilet was clogged. It took a day and a half to fix that but they made a big stink about it and demanded hotel accommodation (this becomes a pattern). We agreed on a discount on rent since it was the start of their lease and assumed it was the previous tenants or the renovation workers.\n\nOn memorial day weekend they called at midnight claiming that we changed the locks without notifying them. I was out of town and there was construction going on at the house so I wasn\u2019t sure if what they\u2019re saying is true. They demanded hotel accommodation (again) but we refused and asked to get a locksmith. The workers later told us that the handle was new but they hadn\u2019t put in the lock on the main door yet since the tenants were out.\n\nLast Thursday night, there was a gas leak on their floor. They called the company and the gas line was shut off for both our floors (at midnight). It was fixed by Friday afternoon but the office hours was over and they said they can\u2019t come before Monday (today). The tenants kicked up a row again, screaming at us at the street and demanding\u2026hotel accommodation.\n\nThis morning they told us the toilet is clogging again. They have two toddlers so we think they\u2019re flushing the wipes or something. And in this one month they\u2019ve lost their keys twice and had to break the lock on their door.\n\nNow, our contract was for a year but we\u2019re going to give them a notice in a couple days since we\u2019ve spent more money fixing stuff for them than we got from the rent.\n\nCan we keep the deposit?",

            "comment": "1) What state is the property in?  \n\n2) Map out your strategy with a local real property lawyer now, rather than bringing him/her into the situation after you've complicated it futher.\n\n3) Your lease and/or state law may give you the right to inspect the property during their tenancy.  Consider doing this and documenting (with photos) anything that is a danger to the property, like a fire hazard or something that would attract vermin, or the basement meth lab.\n\n4) Did you do research on them before they moved in?  If not, maybe it's worth doing that now, or having your lawyer's paralegal do that, in case it turns up any information that affects your strategy going forward\n\n5) Generally, you can deduct damages from a security deposit.  There is usually a very specific process for doing this, with fixed timelines.  This will depend on local law, and your lawyer can give you specific advice.  You can even get a judgment for damages that exceed the security deposit, but this may be more trouble than it's worth...they seem like they would be hard to collect from.",

For example, if you see non-flushable wipes in the john and no wipes in the trash can, that supports certain inferences.\n\n4) I like numbered lists!",

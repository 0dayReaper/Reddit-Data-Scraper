    "postText": "So I got run over by a drunk driver who happened to be an illegal immigrant in a stolen truck last year. I was in the next city over helping a friend with yard work when it happened. Complete pass over of my abdomen and twisted me up. They took me to the nearest emergency room. At the hospital they did a scan of my neck and my shoulder and that's it. I was left alone for over twelve hours in the worst pain I'd ever experienced. I'd buzz for a nurse and someone would come in saying the Dr would be with me asap. Never happened. I eneded up requesting ama since no one had seen me and I wanted to go to a hospital in my city with Dr's I knew and trusted. At my hometown hospital they did more scans and ultimately released me after an additional four hours of assessment. Fast forward a year later and I'm still afflicted with issues from the accident. My abdominal wall is weak and I've herniated my umbilical with pain in several other areas. Can I sue anyone? As far as I'm aware the man that ran me down was deported so I don't think I can do much on that end but can I sue the hospital for negligence? Am I just fucked for life now?\n\nWhat was found at the hospital was that my ac joint was a grade 3 separation. Nothing was assessed for my abdomen. Orthopedic surgeon said surgery wouldn't be beneficial to me as the bone would gradually return to its new position.",

Unfortunately, as you correctly deduce, suing someone who lives in another country and likely was in America illegally (which suggest, but does not guarantee, the person was lower income / lower assets) is not a good prospect for recovery.",

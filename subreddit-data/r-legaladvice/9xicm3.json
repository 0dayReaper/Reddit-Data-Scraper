    "postText": "Tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. This is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. What is a surprise is it's suddenness.\n\nI've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what I made on day-care.\n\nSo in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me \"Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit\". I would say I was shocked, but I really am not. He's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. \n\nI obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? I understand it's all \"his\" money but we are married with a child. I don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.\n\nI'm in Wisconsin, I've tried to Google up the best could since the little one went to sleep but I can't find what I'm looking for or even really know what I'm looking for. Thanks for anyone who helps",

When another poster said it will come back to haunt him, it's because it is very illegal to move /hide marital assets prior to divorce in order to keep them from the other party.  When you get into court this is potentially going to prejudice the judge against him.\n\nGoing forward keep all your communication with him via text or email. From what I was able to find, Wisconsin is a one party consent state so you can record phone calls without telling him. Get yourself an app to do this and test it before you need it. Also get a voice recorder app, clear your phones memory card and be prepared to record any time you even think somethings going to happen.\n\nFor yourself, it looks like this is  going to be ugly. It's going to be awful and hard. Take a deep breath, get your support network in place and make very sure when you text him you stay calm. Imagine the text being read in court. Imagine the recording being played in front of a judge.\n\nYou will get through this. Get a lawyer and do what that lawyer tells you. ",

There is another program, TANF, which provides temporary financial assistance to families. Your local DHS office can help you apply for both if you feel the need. Also, you might call your local city offices, as they may be able to help you locate money to pay electric and/or gas bills.\n\nI\u2019m sorry again that this isn\u2019t advice on the divorce, but if you don\u2019t have a support network in place, these things may help so you can focus on getting your affairs in order.",

I think UW has a \"Family Court Clinic\" but you may want to see what the help looks like- whether they're going to help you go in as a prepared pro se (self represented) or will be providing  you with some representation.\n\nFor the urgency, you may want to go with a regular family law attorney, but clinics can be a great affordable option.  Law students/faculty are a particularly reasonable option since it sounds like you aren't going to have to deal with a custody battle if he's skipping town.\n\nEdit: Typos",

Go to the website for the law school(s) (starting with the nearest geographically) in your state, and look for \u201cclinics\u201d or \u201cclinical programs.\u201d  You should be able to find a list of programs that the law school offers to its second and third year students to give them supervised hands-on experience with pro bono representation for people facing certain types of legal issues. Family law is a common clinical program at many law schools \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.  There should be a phone number, email address, or link to an intake website for people who want to request help or representation from the clinic (which they may or may not take, for any number of reasons). \n\nThere is every reason to see if that\u2019s available, in addition to the bar association referral services others have mentioned.

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "My sons father and I have been broken up for 8 year now. He has been paying child support for the last three years at $400 per month. This amount was what he set it at. He is a narcissist and I accepted just to make my life easier as I try to avoid all conflicts with him. This month he decided after talking to a \u201cclient\u201d that he was over paying me for the past three years. He feels that the amount should be closer to $170. I carry the insurance and pay for all day care. We do a 60/40 schedule during the school year and 50/50 during breaks. He runs a 100% cash business (tattoo shop) and says he only made 33k last year. Yet he is the sole employee and is open 7 days a week. I have spoken with an attorney who advised me that we would seek his financial records to determine true income but I feel like he can hide everything. I just want him to keep paying the same amount. I have no interest is asking for more money or for him to have less time. Can anyone guide me as to how we would find this hidden money and how that would play out in court? Illinois is the state.",

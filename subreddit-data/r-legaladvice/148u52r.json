    "postText": "My boss is the general manager of a pizza place, I\u2019m a driver. He is only like 22 years old and has no idea what he\u2019s doing. He basically got the job 4 months after he started there because he was in the right place right time. I put in my 2 weeks about a week ago and now my he is taking almost all of my hours and now he is saying he is not scheduling me at all until the 2 weeks is up. This guy is a weasel and really just says whatever he wants and the general manager does not care at all. I\u2019m just wondering if I have any protection against this or if I\u2019m screwed and have to find another job sooner than I thought. I\u2019ve already been applying to places but it\u2019s not as easy as I was 17 and I could definitely use the money from an extra week of work.",

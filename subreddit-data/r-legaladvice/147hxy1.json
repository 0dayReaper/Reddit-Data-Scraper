    "postText": "This takes place in Texas, my neighbor has a lot of stuff laid out on his property that he does not live on and uses as storage. There is a meth house up the road from me on a dead end road, that is known to cops they just won\u2019t do anything about it. Which has been known to steal as you would expect, and two days ago he sent me a thread of vague and intimidating messages. Where he was half accusing me of stealing various unnamed items over Facebook messenger, and wanted to meet with me at Monday 9:00 am. He was very adamant on that time as if it were a cut off where he said the situation would be out of his hands, and when I asked where he said the local sheriff\u2019s department to sit in a room and have a \u201cconversation\u201d. Today he was making threats of having the DA, or a judge get a felony warrant for me. I can\u2019t afford a lawyer and need advice on how to deal with this, I can\u2019t afford a legal battle or disruption from work and I\u2019m scared of wrongful charges. As the police are notoriously useless, and a bit corrupt where I live. Should I not speak to him further and wait for contact from law enforcement, could he just be using scare tactics, etc. I\u2019m just worried about this from a financial standpoint when it comes to having to possibly defend myself legally, and would appreciate any advice as I\u2019ve never had a situation like this happen to me or anyone around me.",

I haven\u2019t responded to him at all, I\u2019ve just been reading messages. He is incessant that I will he going to jail for Felony theft, I think he may be on painkillers again as he\u2019s had a history with them. Do you think that if In a situation where one would have proof of such a crime that the police response time would be faster? I\u2019m waiting for anything to happen or for him to say, or do something extreme before I file a report.",

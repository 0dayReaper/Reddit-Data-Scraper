    "postText": "We checked this couch for bugs about a week before we brought it into our home. Today we have took it into the house (we man handled it a bit more taking it out of a uhaul truck which may have startled the roaches into actually moving around) and immediately took the couch out of the apartment and sent it back to the store and got a few refund.\n\nWe had just moved into this apartment less than a week ago so there\u2019s no way it was on our end since the apartment had to pass inspection to even be sold to us.\n\nI have video/photo evidence of this infested couch they tried to sell to us. Evidence of roaches crawling out of the couch as well as the time we rented the uhaul and brought it right back. Still even have the receipt.\n\nNow we fear of having a potential roach outbreak on our hands. This couch was in the apartment for less than 5 minutes before we sent it back however, our main concern is that eggs fell out and some roaches may have fallen out and skittered into the nearby vent for complete access to the rest of the rooms. We did spray but, there\u2019s a chance we may not have been quick enough.\n\nHow liable would this business be for any damage or health problems that may arise from this? Do you think they would have to pay for an exterminator? How easily do you think they could defend against concrete video and photo evidence of the roaches coming out of this couch??",

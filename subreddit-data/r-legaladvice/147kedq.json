Whether you'll get the money back depends primarily on (1) whether you can prove the money is owed to you, and (2) whether the debtor has assets you can collect from.\n\nIssue one will probably depend on what kind of documentation you have.  Is there any kind of promissory note or loan agreement?  Is there other documentation showing this person agreed to repay you?  Can you prove how much you loaned this person?\n\nI don't have any information about the second issue.  You'll have to evaluate that on your own, and decide if there is any reasonable expectation you can collect on a judgment.",

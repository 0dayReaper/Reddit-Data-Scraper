    "postText": "Hi, I changed my name today by going to the District Court and filling out a form. All they asked was signature, date, old name, new name, and phone number. No date of birth or social security number needed. This is kind of a dumb question, but how do they know I'm me? I guess I just don't understand the process of it all after I send in the form. Thanks! WA specific",

If not, you'll probably be given a court date to appear before a judge, who will ask questions.  Mostly it's to make sure that you're not trying to dodge bad credit or a criminal charge or some other fraudulent reason.",

    "postText": "So, I have a bit of an online friend group, and while the majority of my friends are around my age, one of my friends is 15. Now, there\u2019s nothing inappropriate going on between us (besides occasional dirty jokes) and everyone\u2019s comfortable with each other. However lately I\u2019ve started getting panickey over the actual morality/legality of this. Is it ok for me to be friends with a 15 yr old? Or could I get accused of grooming??\n\nEdit: for people suspecting e of actually being some kind of groomer, I have severe anxiety and OCD, and am currently actually dealing with a type of ocd called \u201cpedophile OCD\u201d, where you\u2019re irrationally terrified of somehow being a pedo",

    "postText": "My husband is a 61 year old Latino male who has worked at his current company for 17 years in a corporate supply chain position. They hired another person to help him out 1.5 years ago. This coworker is a 38 yr male.\n\nTheir parent employer is medium sized but my husband's division has about 100 employees. My husband is still mentoring this newer hire. \n\nWe were worried, since they aren't as busy and revenues are down, that there could be layoffs but felt secure with him being a 17 year employee vs a 1 year employee.\n\nYesterday, Hubby was told that he his co-worker has been promoted, and he now reports to him. There was no job posted or even a hint of a new position opening up. The opposite has been presented - that they are tightening their belts.\n\nWe are worried that they will lay him off soon. Before, if they let him go and they were peers, it would be obvious age discrimination. Now they can just say his role is gone and the work is being absorbed by the mgr.\n\nWe are at a loss at what to do. Question employer on this? Consult with a lawyer? Do nothing and just aggressively job hunt?\n\nEdit for length.\n\n.",

    "postText": "My apartment has mold. The apartment complex refuses to fix this, among other things such as leaks, outlets not up to code, etc. \n\nThe mold is most important. All of us are experiencing health issues due to the mold (confirmed by doctors) and two months after moving in one of my roommates cats died suddenly. The vet ruled the death to be from mold. \n\nThey recently did an air quality test in my apartment, but are now refusing to give us the results of the test. Is this legal? What action can we take to get the situation resolved?",

You are probably going to have to pay for your own test or try contacting code enforcement, (you should note that if this is an issue of habitability, contacting code enforcement could result in your tenancy being ended). This reply assumes US, but laws do vary by jurisdiction.",

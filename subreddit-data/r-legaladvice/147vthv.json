We were boarded onto the plane and on a waiting list for the run way, 2 hours later the flight was cancelled, and then 45 mins after that the full 10 day holiday as they couldn\u2019t find us a reasonable replacement flight. \n\nEnded up being stuck on the plane for 3 and a half hours in total before they let us off, and then left us waiting for over 2 hours in baggage claim with no information.\n\nAll i\u2019ve had from them is a couple of texts/emails saying it\u2019s been cancelled and I get a full refund, but feel like I should be entitled to more compensation for the whole ordeal.\n\nThey\u2019re currently listing the reason online as the weather, almost certain that\u2019s just a cover story to save them money when the entire media is covering the NATO air exercises. \n\nDoes anyone have advice as to how to deal with this best, and what we would be entitled to?",

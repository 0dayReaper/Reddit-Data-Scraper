    "postText": "My wife was injured on the job. She was and still is a special education teacher. She taught 3 years for a well known large school system. In October of 22 she was injured by a student. She since left that school system for another (and is happier) but still suffers secondary effects of the assault. It\u2019s a head trauma. She getting treatments at the concussion clinic weekly through the former county\u2019s LTD insurance provider Sedgwick. Now they\u2019re trying to pull the treatments and attempting to close the claim!?! We feel we deserve better.",

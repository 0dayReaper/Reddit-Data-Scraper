    "postText": "Hello, I am looking to sell my car. I bought it outright using a personal bank loan two years ago. I am still paying off that loan and I wanted to check if I need to notify the bank that I am selling the car? I know if I was using finance to pay off the car I would need to notify the finance company and get a settlement but this was a personal loan from the bank that I used to purchase the car outright so it is mine on paper. \n\nAny advice or insight would be much appreciated thank you.",

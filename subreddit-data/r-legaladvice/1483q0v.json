    "postText": "Someone scraped the front of my car two months ago and left a note on my front windshield giving his name and number. He admitted fault on text and said he would prefer to pay out of pocket and I accepted. After sending him a $1,500 quote from the auto body, he agreed to pay but after giving him the method of payment he stopped responding to messages for the past two weeks. I have pictures of the car, his note, and the texts. Is the next step to file a hit-and-run or has too much time passed to do anything?",

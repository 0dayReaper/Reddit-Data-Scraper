    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm a college student and my siblings and my mother have joint ownership of a property in Florida. She is claiming that she would like to get hurricane insurance for the property but needs to have majority ownership of the property to do so. So, she's asked me to sign over my share to her, and has presumably done the same with my siblings, am I being scammed? It seems like insurance companies are aware that there exist properties with more than one joint owner and requiring someone to own a majority of the property seems strange, especially in the case of say, a married couple where each owns 50% or some such. \n\nThanks!",

Is the property owned by a trust or similar and you are all part owner, or are all 5 owners listed on the deed? \n\nFor your husband and wife scenario, they are typically both listed on any insurance policy",

This happens all the time,  especially with commercial property. It might not be a scam though, could be miscommunication or bad advice from someone selling insurance. Or it could be a scam.",

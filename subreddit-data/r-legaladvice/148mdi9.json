    "postText": "Hello Reddit,\n\nWhat is the best choice to continue the process of a DV Lottery visa. In the US or home country? I'm debating where to stay in the US or going back to Europe. The lawyers I have talked to haven't really gave me a straight answer, but I would like to know if there is any differences between doing it on the US or doing it in my home country.  I heard that usually going back to your country might be faster and easier.",

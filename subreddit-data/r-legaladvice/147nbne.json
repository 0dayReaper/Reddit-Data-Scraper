    "postText": "Hello this is a bit of a tricky situation. For some back story my husband\u2019s dad passed away a few years ago. His dad had one sister and grandfather is divorced. Husband\u2019s dad was the power of attorney for grandfather but of course that went to aunt when dad passed. Grandfather has been in some sort of care home for the past year due to dementia. We\u2019ve never lived close by whereas aunt\u2019s family live in the same town but we\u2019ve visited when we can. There is a bit of a strained relationship between aunt and husband\u2019s mom since she got remarried.\nWhen the grandfather passed away over a year ago we thought nothing of if there was a will or anything like that. We couldn\u2019t even go to the funeral because husband\u2019s aunt hurried up the funeral and it was on a Thursday far from where we live. \nA few weeks ago it came up because my aunt donated money to my husband\u2019s fund raiser saying \u201cit\u2019s from grandfather.\u201d We were joking about how he\u2019s got our back even when he\u2019s dead which made me realize that we hadn\u2019t ever heard if there was a will reading. My husband texts her to ask if there was a will reading and she said there wasn\u2019t a will and all his investments went to herself.\nNow we\u2019re sort of at a cross roads where we\u2019re trying to decide what the best thing to do would be. Her saying \u201call his investments went to me\u201d doesn\u2019t sound legal unless she got all his money before he died? Our theory is that he signed over all his money before he went to the memory unit. Any advice would be really great, they\u2019re in Indiana.",

            "comment": "If your husband's grandfather died without a will, then his assets pass according to Indiana's law governing intestate succession.  Under intestate succession, that means his estate would go to his children.  If a child has predeceased grandfather (your husband's father) then your husband's father's share would pass to his children per stirpes, meaning that if your husband's father has three children each would get 1/3 of his share.  \n\nA reading of the will is something that really only takes place in the movies for dramatic purposes, but your husband should likely have been notified when probate was opened for the grandfather's estate.  However, if the grandfather had signed everything over to the aunt, then it would have passed to her outside of the probate process.  \n\nThe place to start would be at the courthouse in the county where the grandfather lived to see if probate was opened and what, if anything, was filed with the court.  Your husband may also wish to consult a local probate attorney.",

                    "comment": "If the decedent's investment accounts had beneficiary designations, then those generally pass directly to the beneficiary, outside the decedent's estate. That means that the intestate rules about dividing up an estate would not apply to those funds.\n\nIf that is what happened, then the validity of those beneficiary designations would depend on how and when they were done, and possibly on the decedent's mental state when they were done.\n\nUnfortunately, it may be difficult for you to obtain this information. Since you are not the account owner, and not (apparently) a beneficiary, the financial institution will probably not give you any information.  You can ask your husband's aunt, but in my experience people in that position often choose not to be forthcoming.  Bottom line, you may have to hire a lawyer and incur some fees just to find out exactly what happened.",

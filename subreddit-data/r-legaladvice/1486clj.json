    "postText": "My paternal grandmother passed away without leaving a will behind, apparently. My uncle decided to serve as her personal representative, and sent me a form to be notarized (#302ES ; this is taking place in South Carolina, USA). The form is titled \"Renunciation of right to administration and/or nomination and/or waiver of bond\", which a google search leads me to believe that this will allow my uncle to serve as the informal personal representative of the estate. however, the decedent's name (my grandmother) is missing from the document, and the provided case number is incomplete (searching it up on the online county records lists a lot of cases from this year, and a manual search through them shows nothing concerning my uncle or grandmother's names).\n\nAs personal experience, my uncle doesn't have the most honest streak, but I don't know what he would have to gain from this as he's not my grandmother's biological son (the son of my grandfather from another marriage) and I believe probate is for living relatives?\n\nShould I sign this and have it notarized? leave it be? or ask him to send one that has the relevant information on it? Thx for any comments.",

The bond protects the heirs from any malfeasance by the PR. So if you don't think he's trustworthy, definitely don't waive the bond requirement.",

            "comment": "There is no one correct answer here, it is about how you want to proceed.\n\nIf you want to be the administrator of the estate then do not sign this. If you want your uncle to be the administrator then you can sign this. If you don't really want either of those things to happen then don't sign the form, as your uncle can still apply to be administrator and this doesn't effect any potential inheritance you will receive. If you specifically don't want your uncle to the administrator then you need to have someone else apply or your need to file an objection.\n\nIn terms of distributions where someone dies without a will the word you're looking for is intestacy not probate. Probate is just the process of applying to the court to administer the estate which is then distributed as \"intestate\" (without a will).\n\nThe rules are here [South Carolina Probate Code](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t62c002.php)",

            "comment": "There is nothing wrong with the form itself. It's just a way for the people interested in an estate to agree on who will serve as administrator.  (Although I would not sign a form that is not properly filled out.)\n\nThe bigger issue is whether your uncle is a good choice to be administrator.  If you consider him untrustworthy, I would be wary of putting him in a position where he has custody and control of other people's property.  He has a legal obligation to distribute property to the heirs, and you have procedures to enforce that obligation, but it's much better to never have a problem in the first place.\n\nOf course, if your uncle is not appointed as administrator, then someone else will have to serve.  And, if your uncle presses the issue, you might have a contested hearing in the probate court where you have to explain why you think your uncle is a bad choice.\n\nWhat are the other beneficiaries of the estate doing? If you are united in opposing your uncle, it might be more persuasive to the probate court.  Even better if everyone can agree on an alternate candidate.",

            "comment": "&gt;doesn't have the most honest streak\n\nThen don't sign anything.\n\nI recommend you contact all of your grandmother's kids you trust (if any) and then make arrangements to talk to a lawyer. Consultations are typically probono and you could even have a zoom call with everyone involved you TRUST (so not your uncle). I had to do this recently and we hired the lawyer as a group to do all the paperwork/proceedings for my grandma's estate. Everything varies by state and also, by whether your grandma had a property or something.\n\n&gt;I don't know what he would have to gain from this as he's not my grandmother's biological son (the son of my grandfather from another marriage) and I believe probate is for living relatives?\n\nI don't know the intricacies here, but for instance, my grandparents had a property. It was their 2nd marriage and each had kids from previous marriages (both widowed). My grandfather died and the next year my grandma died. Now because they had the property together and it was bought after they married, it was divided between all of the kids after my grandma died. After my grandfather died my grandma kept living there so nothing had been \"split\" and no paperwork had been done.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it's complicated.",

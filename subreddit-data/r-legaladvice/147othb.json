    "postText": "In 2020, my partner was unable to work because of the pandemic. Partner was approved for unemployment (UI) starting June 1, 2020, but did not receive the first payment until the end of August. UI undercut and underpaid, and did not payout any of the additional emergency benefits. The last payment received was in August 2022 for $37. \n\nPartner has been trying to follow up with this, but it has been slow because partner is primary SAHP to an 18-mo (baby is now in pre-k). When I calculated what was received vs. what was owed based on weekly payout and emergency benefits, there was ~22k owed to us. Partner has been trying to contact UI, but will be stuck on the phone for hours and often hung up on (i.e., on more than one occassion, it happened because baby cried in background). Partner is given the run around when a human is finally on the other end of the line. \n\nWhere do we go from here? I am worried about an SoL and worried about how UI keeps going about this. One last thing that may be relevant or not, partner is a legal immigrant with an accent from an English-speaking country.\n\nEdit: fixed dates.",

I'd probably file the appeal nonetheless.",

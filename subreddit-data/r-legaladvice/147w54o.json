    "postText": "After many months of continued complaining about simple fixable issues I lost my cool and had an outburst at my boss. They let me go. Any other place I've worked I've seen them use a PIP, final warning, etc, because from what I understood this lays a clear paper trail for them to appeal unemployment. But this place is so unprofessional I wonder if I could try to apply and they'd either just pay it, or try to appeal but they have no constructive trail showing my bad behavior or anything like that. I also plan to get a new job ASAP",

And yes, the state will verify with your employer the circumstances of your termination. Your employer doesn't have to appeal. They simply have to tell the truth on the form. If you receive conditional benefits and it's determined that you aren't eligible, you will have to pay back the benefits you received.\n\nIf you are denied unemployment YOU can appeal. But you'd have to be pretty brazen to lie to an administrative law judge in an administrative law hearing after lying to get unemployment. That's several kinds of illegal.",

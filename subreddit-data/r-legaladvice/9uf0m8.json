    "postText": "This happened in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSo this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a \"bum like person\" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. \n\nI found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. \n\nFor more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. \n\nAll we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. \n\nBoyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. \n\nI dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. \n\nEDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.\n\n\nEDIT: formatting and grammar",

They may already have an order pending against your landlord.\n\nSecond; fill out a [T6 - Tenant Application about Maintenance](http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/forms/#tenant-forms) and file it asap.  The LTB has a backlog as they're short of adjudicators, and the current government had imposed a hiring freeze, so you want to move quickly in hopes of getting a hearing in the next few weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, please buy yourself a good smoke detector and a carbon monoxide detector.

If you still feel guilty about reporting her, think about it as preventing potential injuries in the future-- not just your own, but other tenants living in her building whose alarms could break in the future.

Your lease may state who is responsible for raising any work orders with the condo corp. \n\nCould they evict you? Not easily on these grounds, but they could make your life difficult and they could evict you for personal use.

You should *also* contact your local department on their NON-EMERGENCY LINE, explain that you live in an apartment, you have a non-functioning notification device in your unit, and that you weren't awakened by the common-area notification devices, ie strobes or audible alarms.

If you have to move so be it... but make it hell on her. Had a landlord put out rat poison without any notice to tenants. Neighbors dog got ahold of some (she lived but yes got very sick) needless to say i dont think anyone paid rent there for 4-6 months. The neighbor basically lived for free from them on out he was a good tenant and had lived there for 10 years already. Landlord was a decent guy but there are laws for a reason.",

            "comment": "The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

    "postText": "So I was working for more than a year in a small business, I believe it\u2019s about 10 people working there. They accepted my FMLA verbally, it was to give birth. They paid 6 weeks and 6 weeks unpaid. When I try to return, the manager said that I\u2019ve been replaced cause the person they hire temporarily has more experienced than me. I was thinking of doing a DOL complaint, but I don\u2019t know if I have a case since it was a verbal agreement and the business has fewer than 15 people. I have text messages as proof of the FMLA and manager not letting me return. My question is: Do I have a case or should I just drop it.",

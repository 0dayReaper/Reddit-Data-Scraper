    "postText": "About a year ago my housemate had a friend who was being kicked out of where they live. Without asking me, he allowed them to leave some stuff here \"until they found a new place to stay\" which consisted of a bunch of junk that is sitting inside of a small boat. I don't know exactly how it would be classified, like a two person fishing boat on a little tow trailer\n\nLike a month after this was brought here, this guy and my housemate had a falling out. He says the guy won't talk to him anymore.  Since then, this junk has been sitting in my yard taking up space and looking awful. I don't have a homeowners association or anything but it looks trashy and I'm sick of it being here.\n\nWhat options do I have for getting rid of this thing? He says the guy won't communicate with him anymore. It's been sitting here for going on a year at this point and he's made no effort to reach out or to come get it. Am I within my rights to dispose of it or would that open me up to some kind of legal problems if randomly sometime down the line he decided he wanted the thing back?",

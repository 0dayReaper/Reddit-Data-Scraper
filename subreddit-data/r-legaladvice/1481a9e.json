The sessions take place during regular business hours at a time that is most convenient for myself and many other members. Is this even legal? I don\u2019t want to sue or anything, I would just like to be able to use the gym.",

I can see why helping out historically marginalized groups can be good, but I don\u2019t get how it\u2019s legal per se. At what point is it illegal. Can you close the gym 90% of the time for these groups? Or is just a couple times a month all that\u2019s acceptable? I support the intent of these programs, but I can\u2019t help but wonder what would happen if the roles were reversed.",

Your contract with the gym probably doesn't forbid them from closing for private events.\n\nBut offering 100% discounts for persons on the basis of sex, gender identity, and race is a lot closer to unlawful price discrimination.\n\nThis may be a matter of \"who cares enough to litigate\".    Plenty of California bars still have gender-based \"ladies night\" discounts even though it's black-letter law that they are unlawfully discriminatory.",

    "postText": "I hired a lawyer to help me with an immigration matter where I was very clear in what I needed, and he told he had the experience. He charged me two flat fees for two related but separate matters, $3500 &amp; $6500. \n\nHe spent about 1.5 months preparing for the first matter, and then another 3-4 months for the second thing. He told me the first thing is a pre-requisite for the second thing. \n\nI was denied for the first application after waiting for 7 months. Then, I found out while waiting for the second application that I never needed the first application. In fact, even if I got approved for the first application, it would have done nothing to further the more important second application.\n\nI also later found out this oversight is public information that you can just find by googling and reading from other law firm\u2019s websites. So I\u2019m pissed that he 1) lied about having the necessary experience and 2) didn\u2019t bother to do research and find out the facts.\n\nHe has been prompt in returning my emails and answering questions but still, I\u2019m out a couple months of my time and almost $5000 of expenses ($3500 of his fees and over 1k of filing fees) due to his negligence. There\u2019s also associated business losses due to this delay but I\u2019m just going to eat it.\n\nDo I have any right to ask him for at least some of the money back? What would be a fair amount?",

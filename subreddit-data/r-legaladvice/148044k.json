    "postText": "My pops got his 3rd DUI last weekend. His most recent one before that was in early 2000. He owns the car I currently drive and also owns his truck that he uses. \n\nI live on my own. Renting my own place for the last several years, while I still have the same childhood mailing address that my parents both live at. \n\nMy question is how are whiskey plates going to play a role. Since he owns the sedan I drive, will I have to get whiskey plates as well? Will my mother have to get whiskey plates since she\u2019s in the same house hold? Will my siblings have to get whiskey plates on their own cars even if they have the same household mailing address but rent a living space at a different location?",

Georgia has a similar designation but they're the standard color.\n\nWhat state is your car registered in ?\n\nYou might not have to get the special plates if your father's DUI doesn't qualify, or if you're in Minnesota and he opts for an ignition interlock (an option available since 2021).\n\nI don't believe that the degree of association for special plates is \"owned by a household member\" but rather \"registered solely or partially to the DUI offender\" or \"driven by the DUI offender at the time of arrest\".\n\nIn your case since your father owns the car, the plates will likely be impounded and you'd need to get new ones and pay the surcharge.\n\nThis is a very good opportunity to transfer your car to your own name and get your license and insurance information correctly associated with your actual mailing address.",

It is not common for it to be a relative or other individual that is different from the registered owner.   [DPS Form PS2000](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/forms-documents/Documents/MV_TitleandRegisterMotorVehicleApplication.pdf) doesn't have a distinction between the Title and Registration applicant.\n\nTo my knowledge, the \"registered owner\" is the person required to get \"whiskey plates\" in the event of a multiple DUI conviction that is eligible.\n\nI don't know enough about MN's new interlock law to know if it's going to apply to all vehicles registered to your father.   It could, or it might apply only to ones he has access to drive.",

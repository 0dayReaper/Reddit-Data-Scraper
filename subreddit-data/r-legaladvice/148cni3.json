    "postText": "My doctor's surgery accused me of lying about having called to ask if I could collect a prescription later that day when I went in to collect it. Forgetting I'd not installed a phone recording app on my phone since my last upgrade I said that \"I've got a recording of the call if you want me to prove that I called in?\" before being told \"you aren't allowed to record phone calls with any of our staff. We record all of our phone calls anyway.\"\n\nAfter confirming I hadn't actually recorded the call I showed them the phone call that showed that I'd been on the line for 25 minutes, to which the receptionist immediately retorted with \"yeah, but that could have just been you on hold\", insinuating that I was lying about that as well.\n\nUltimately I was shooed away from the surgery to a chorus of rolling eyes and tuts. I had to cancel an important trip scheduled for the next morning so that I could collect my prescription before the weekend. It's not the first time something like this has happened and I'm pretty much fed up with it. I've asked for a meeting with the senior doctor that indirectly refused to honour my request. I will ask them in advance to retrieve a copy of my call in, but also wanted to know whether they were right in saying that it is not legal for me to record a call into the surgery without their consent?\n\nFrom what I've read online this is untrue, but most of the material that I could find was directed at businesses rather than individuals. Would anyone be able to clarify for me?\n\nMany thanks",

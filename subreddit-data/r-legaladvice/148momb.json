    "postText": "Person A is in charge of the decedent\u2019s estate. Person B is offspring of decedent. Person B was given property from decedent as a gift roughly 2 1/2 years prior to decedent\u2019s passing. Person A is now demanding Person B produce the property for photos to be taken of the items in question. Person B has offered to take photos themselves and send these photos to the attorney representing decedent\u2019s estate. Person B is repeatedly met with demand for items and threat of court action from Person A. No receipts exist from this transaction as gifts don\u2019t have receipts. Both Persons C and D named in the will have received their items from the will and both have items from decedent from the same time frame in their possession and have not been asked to take photos or produce the items. \n\n\nDoes Person B have to produce the items? \n\n\nThe state is Ohio.",

In fact there is a concerted united front on this particular matter between Person A, the attorney, and the auctioneer hired to sell the items not expressly listed in the will for the estate. \n\n\nI advised him to seek legal counsel. I have nothing but a bad feeling about this, but sometimes that\u2019s all it takes.",

And I'd probably follow up with \"Why isn't it good enough for me to send you photos that I took?\"\n\nIs there a pending legal dispute involving this property? If a lawsuit is pending, then the parties get discovery, and one form of discovery can be asking the other side to produce things for inspection.  But that presumes there is some pending legal proceeding for which the property is relevant, and the request is usually made formally pursuant to the applicable rules of court.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nWe purchased a house in London 1.5 year ago and a few months after we\u2019ve moved in, we noticed some stains appearing on the ceiling and realised they were due to the poor roof condition. We had a survey of the house done before the purchase and it didn\u2019t mention such flaw, probably because it would have been quite difficult to spot. The house has been freshly repainted when we bought it and as time progressed water has been infiltrating and stains have been appearing. Some roof specialists came around and said that the roof has been poorly constructed and that it needed to be redone, which is going to be very expensive. I know that in France there is a law for \u00ab\u00a0hidden flaws\u00a0\u00bb that legally protects the purchaser for the first few years after the purchase in case a major flaw becomes visible after some time but was unnoticeable at the time of the purchase. Does such a legal guarantee exist in England?\nThank you!",

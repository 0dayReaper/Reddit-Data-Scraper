They want you to pay them back at double the rate they gave it to you.  You likely have accounting costs you will incur if any re-filing of your taxes is necessary.  You may have costs related to verifying their information if you need outside help to do so.  There's potentially a statute of limitations issue.  It's plausible that it's legal and correct for them to demand the repayment, but this is going to all be so fact dependent that I think you're beyond what reddit can offer beyond generalities.\n\nI'd see if a free consult or two helps you to clarify your options here and then go from there.  At the very least, if I had to pay back the funds I would want a more relaxed payback schedule than what they have proposed and I would expect them to give me some kind of credit against the amount owed based on any professional help I need to correct my own tax situation.  Given that you are on commission, I might even try to tie the repayment to my sales (e.g. if I get paid 20% commission then maybe I'll take a 14% until my debt is repaid by the difference.  If I have a great month, I pay faster.  If I have a slow month, I'm not on the hook for a huge number.)",

Getting used to the extra $255 then having to pay back $500 a month would be a monthly shortfall of $755 to you which is quite a big slice of pie depending on your overall earnings.  Be honest with yourself about what you can really afford and put that forward.  If you genuinely believed you were entitled to that money, used it in good faith and actually relied on it to pay bills then you could ask them to write some of it off as a good will gesture based on your performance record at work.  They might be willing to do that to get you to sign off on the repayment plan.\n\nIf repayment is going to be hard I'd even go to my manager and ask for a payrise explaining how difficult the situation that payroll has put you in.  They might be willing to nudge it up a little.  What I am trying to say is that your options are really on the negotiating table, they need you to agree to mutually equitable terms.\n\nEdit.  As others have pointed out there are some exceptions so to know which state you are in would allow for a more accurate answer for you.",

They would have to pursue you and spend money to possibly sue you to recover the alleged overpayment. \n\nI understand being honest and not taking advantage but this is years of mistakes on their part. Now they want to make it your problem rather than admitting their mistake. As someone else mentioned, if they did not immediately fire whomever was responsible for this then they are just passing the buck and trying to make it your problem. \n\nTell them sorry but this doesn't make sense and you are not responsible for their error. Tax filings etc would be a pain to deal with. Again this is not your problem.  Ask them to go over every single pay check and see if you were ever underpaid.

And/or an accountant.\n\nThey might only have the right to claw back a fraction of the over-payments, and the rest might just be something they have to eat as a cost of doing business and making accounting mistakes they don't catch for four years.\n\nYou also might have relied to your detriment on their over-payments after such a long time. Eg, you financed a car and/or a house that you could only afford based on your inflated pay.\n\nAnd there are tax implications of having been over-paid, and, consequently, over-taxed, as well as having it either deducted from your current/future pay, or being paid your full amount and then being invoiced for it.\n\nEg, while you were being over-paid, you were paying taxes on that higher pay, and were maybe even bumped up to a higher tax bracket. And now, either having the over-payments deducted from your pay, or especially being paid in full and then invoiced, means you may be taxed on the full amount of your current pay, and then only end up keeping a fraction of it. Essentially, you'd be repaying them with after-tax dollars, after having already been taxed on the over-payments. You'd be paying taxes twice on income you're not even keeping once.\n\nYour situation is a mess, and you'll need an attorney and/or an accountant to make sure you aren't screwed over in the process. Even if you try to work together in good faith and trust them not to deliberately screw you over, it's just complicated and would be easy to think, \"Oh, we over-paid you by $13k, so if we underpay you by $13k, it'll even out.\" And, given it was their error, it seems reasonable the cost of paying for an attorney and/or accountant should fall on them, and could easily run several thousand dollars. That alone should justify them settling for a fraction of the $13k you allegedly owe them. (eg, you repay them $13k, but they pay $3k in attorney and/or accounting fees, so they only net $10k, so there's no reason for you to even entertain repaying the full $13k, even if you do legally owe it, which you may not). It's not crazy to think it might cost nearly the full $13k, and they'll end up netting nothing after all is said and done, while screwing you over in the process. That would justify them just eating it as a matter of good-will, since they wouldn't get to keep the money either way. And if they over-paid you by $255/mo, you should be able to repay however much you end up agreeing you owe at something lower than $500/mo.",

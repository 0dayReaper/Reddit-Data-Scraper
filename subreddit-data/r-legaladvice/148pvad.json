    "postText": "Hello r/legaladvice\n\nI'm not sure if I'm in the right place I just don't know what to do. Long story short in January I switched phone providers due to moving to a different area. With that I also transferred my phone number as I've has this number since 2008 and I didn't want a new one. Starting last month I started not receiving some phone calls and texts. We didn't think anything of it since at that moment I was in an area that didn't have the best service. \n\nFast forward to today and my brother messaged me on messenger saying that someone else was answering my phone. Turns out my old carrier didn't take the number out of their database so when I transferred, my number just showed as inactive in their system. They ended up giving my number to another account and so now I don't receive an undetermined amount of phone calls and text messages. I called the phone company but they say that it wasn't their fault and that nothing can be done unless one of us changes our number. \n\nBasically I'm just looking at what to do next, because this number is very personal to me and I won't be changing it, but what if the other person won't change it either.",

    "postText": "So the company I work for is my local Parks and Recreation and I do seasonal lifeguarding for them at one of their public pools. I have been working for them for 5 years now and every Tuesday they have a 8am inservice which is about an hour long and consist of swimming and honing our lifeguarding skills. But last week I had talked to my manager, Alex, a day before saying I couldn\u2019t make the inservice as I had to do something involving my family. But then my managers boss, Matt, had come to me saying I had to make up the inservice on the next Saturday morning. To which I couldn\u2019t make as I was at the beach. He then came to me saying I had gotten a written warning. My question is, if I don\u2019t make it to these inservice as I have my schedule to not schedule me during those hours, can Matt legally fire me and/or take away hours if I don\u2019t make the trainings.",

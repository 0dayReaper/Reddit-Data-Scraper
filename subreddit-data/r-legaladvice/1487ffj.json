Today I called them, they said it was mailed on 12th May, but it never for delivered to me. \nI am worried that it might have gotten stolen in the process of delivery.\nWhat is the best way to safe guard myself from the identity theft, should i reach out to some authorities to notify that it might be stolen so that I can prove at a later point in time, should i frequently check my driving  records from dmv?",

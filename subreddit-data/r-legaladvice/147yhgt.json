However, In Florida the Romeo and Juliet statute says as long as you are under 24 you can have sexual relations with someone who is 16 or 17. Can she really do anything about us legally?",

She can ground you or do whatever other parenting things she chooses to around this relationship.  \n\nShe cannot see him charged with a crime unless the two of you exchange nude photos or he exposes you to drugs or alcohol or something else unlawful.",

    "postText": "The California summer heat is rearing its ugly head, and I'm not one to enjoy a sauna in my own home. But luckily I prepared for this by renting a place that has central AC. Except I didn't. I went to turn on the AC to get reprieve from the the heat, and the fan turned on but it didn't cool anything. I contacted the landlord who hired an hvac expert to come by who informed me that there is no AC installed in the first place.   \n\n   I'm paying a pretty hefty price for this place which I justified thinking it has central AC. Now that I know it doesn't and I have already paid this premium for 6 months, what are my options? I have the original ad which says the place has air conditioning, and I also have messages where I asked the landlord directly if it has AC to which he confirmed. The only issue is that the actual lease does not mention AC or even heating.\n\n   I can ask the landlord to provide a portable AC, but I will still be paying more than I think is worth for a place without central AC, not to mention I have already paid more than is worth under false pretenses.   \n\n   My lease has just recently expired and I am on month to month terms.\n\nThis whole thing has got me pretty heated...",

            "comment": "&gt;My lease has just recently expired and I am on month to month terms.\n\nThis has a relatively simple outcome.  \n\nThat landlord hired an HVAC expert suggests that he too is in some way surprised by or confused by the outcome here.  He owes you a correction.  That correction probably doesn't look backward to before you reported a concern - even in these somewhat egregious circumstances.  And when ending the lease is an option he probably has that option.",

Is he willing to install it?  \n\nCertainly you can ask him to install it. Certainly you can ask him to take $200 off your rent for not having it. You can even ask for that backward. But you didn\u2019t lose anything in the past. Installing ac tomorrow would seem to be a complete and total remedy. Saying \u201cno, I won\u2019t install ac, and I\u2019ll take $200 off your rent for June and July, and here\u2019s notice to end your tenancy,\u201d also seems like a remedy.",

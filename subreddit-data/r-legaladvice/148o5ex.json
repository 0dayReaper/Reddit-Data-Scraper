    "postText": "I need advice because I\u2019ve been told so many different things. I live in an apartment and discovered mold last week. A plumber came out and explained the way the shower is built there are basically holes on the inside draining directly into both walls. A mold company came out and explained they will need to take apart the wall and set up containment. I have autoimmune disease and asthma. I expressed to my apartment I want to break my lease because of this and I don\u2019t want to be here when they take the wall apart. The apartment offered to move me to a different unit. I said I would just like to breaks the lease and they said in that case I would need to pay the break lease fee of $6,600. They explained that this cannot be waived because they are doing everything they can to eliminate the issue but my thing is they caused the issue by building a shower that drains into the wall! Does anyone have advice?",

I would rather just leave.",

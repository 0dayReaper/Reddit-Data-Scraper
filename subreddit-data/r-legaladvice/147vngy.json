    "postText": "Location: CA.\n\nSo I won a case in small claims. I sued the \"guy's legal name DBA business name\" to cover my ass. After I won, I started receiving text messages from the guy's cell phone # saying he (speaking in the first person) was dead and I wasn't getting anything, etc etc. I figured if he is dead, I'm sure the courts would know, right and maybe there's a real death certificate? Well the time for him to appeal came and went and I haven't gotten paid. SO I went to the court to file a SC-107 &amp; SC-134, took them to get served, paid the fees. Got \"failed/canceled service\" reason given \"per Johnny, defendant now deceased.\" I'm using fake names here, but \"Johnny\" is a nickname that one would use for let's say John. So I'm confused as to what to do from this point on. I called a friend of a friend who's a lawyer and am waiting a call back. Does anyone have any idea what to do at this point? Re-serve the papers noting \"AKA Johnny\"? Or just wait down the block and take a snapshot to prove that he is in fact alive? I've seen on the business' google page, \"Johnny\" is actively replying to reviews on there and signing \"Johnny, Owner.\" So Idk what the heck to do here...",

It can be delivered in hand, or left with an adult at their last and usual place of abode.  \"Johnny\" could have been handed the documents, assuming it was at his house, and a copy be mailed, to achieve proper service.\n\nAdditionally, if you know what he looks like you can have someone hand him papers.  \n\nOtherwise request a death certificate, and when nothing comes back reattempt service, letting the process server know what's happened.  Alternatively, you can request that the court allow alternative service, but typically they want to see that you've exhausted all other methods.\n\nDepends what the amount of the judgment debt is worth to determine whether or not it's worth it for you or not.  People like this tend to have experience evading service, but it's almost certainly possible.\n\nIf he is dead then you pursue the estate as an unsecured creditor.",

            "comment": "How much are you owed?\n\nThe courts would not necessarily know when someone is dead and that is not necessarily the first place to look.\n\nCheck the website of the county courthouse case search function on a weekly basis to see if anyone ever opens up a probate case for the \"decedent\".  If a case is ever opened, you can file a creditor's claim with the executor of the estate.  A blank form for a creditor's claim should be found somewhere on the probate court's webpage in the \"Forms\" section or call the courthouse to ask where to get the form.\n\nDo you know the street address where he conducted business at, or where his home is?  Could someone stake out the place for a few hours to see if he is spotted coming or going?\n\nDid John/Johnny appear in person at the original small claims court case?  Ask your attorney if you should have followed some type of procedure to have John/Johnny fill out a \"Statement of Assets\" or some other form that would have asked him to supply the name and address of his bank so that you could have begun the legal process of collecting on the judgment by having a law enforcement official go directly to John/Johnny's bank to deduct some of or all of the money due to you, without his permission.",

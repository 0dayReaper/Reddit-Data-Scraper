    "postText": "Hello! I just wanted to see about getting someone\u2019s insight on my current situation regarding my pregnancy/attempting to coparent. \nBackground: I\u2019m currently 34 weeks pregnant, married. My husband and I had split up for a bit, I started a new relationship with another man and got pregnant. After I left him due to it obviously not gonna work out, my husband and I decided to work on our marriage so we got back together. \nThe baby\u2019s father has wanted 50/50 custody, which I was okay with after the newborn stage which we originally agreed to, and after I got back with my husband he changed his mind and wants to start that as soon as she is born. \nI know how terrible that is for the baby, and how much they need consistency, I\u2019m also planning on exclusively breastfeeding at first. I\u2019ve offered to stay with him during this time, or he could stay with me. I\u2019ve been trying to be as understanding as possible, and I\u2019ve given into almost everything he\u2019s asked but I cannot imagine not being with my newborn. I just have no idea what to do, and would like insight from a lawyer. I am in Florida and I know he\u2019d have to establish paternity, but after that I\u2019m just terrified of my small baby being taken away from me so young.",

            "comment": "in florida, the court's main concern is the best interests of the child in custody and visitation cases. if the biological father wants to establish paternity, he will need to file a paternity action. courts prioritize the child's need for stability, consistency, and bonding with the primary caregiver.",

Depending on how far away you live from each other, they could do a significant amount of daytime visits, though (including daily for several hours if circumstances allow). You need an attorney who specializes in family law.",

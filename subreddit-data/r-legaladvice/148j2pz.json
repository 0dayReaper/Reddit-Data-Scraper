I was told since they were smaller than a penny I would not be charged and don\u2019t need to worry about filling them. \n\nUpon move out I was charged $300 for \u201cfilling holes in wall\u201d\n\nDoes the pre move-out inspection have any teeth or do I just have to pay it?\n\nTYIA",

            "comment": "Yes, the landlord is required to present you with a written itemized quote for the damages found in the move out inspection so that you have a chance to fix them (this excludes damages that they couldn't see during inspection, so if you had paintings etc. covering the holes, they may be in the clear). Sounds like there was no quote, and only a verbal agreement that the holes would not be deducted. The verbal agreement holds no weight but not following proper deducting process should. Furthermore, if the holes were small and not excessive (ie hanging some paintings, easy to just paint over, etc.) then they are considered normal wear and tear in california case law and the landlord is not allowed to deduct for them. Furthermore if the paint has reached the end of its useful life (approx 5 years) then the landlord cannot deduct for the cost of repainting. So I would say you have a pretty strong case to dispute the deduction. Next step is to file a strongly worded demand letter requesting the return of that portion of your security deposit, citing some legal resources (easy to find) especially around the wear and tear issue. If they do not return it or respond, your recourse is to take them to small claims court, which is not too hard and you will likely prevail. Document everything carefully, ideally you have photos of the holes in the wall, etc. Good luck and don't let the landlord steal your money!",

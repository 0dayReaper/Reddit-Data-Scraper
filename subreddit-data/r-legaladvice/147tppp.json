Pick a country you want to immigrate to and do some research. Maybe an lgbt advocacy group can help.\n\nImmigration is a lengthy and expensive process. You should consult with a US immigration attorney as well as an attorney from the country you wish to immigrate to, particularly if you want to renounce citizenship.",

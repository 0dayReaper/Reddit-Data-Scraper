    "postText": "If someone rents a boat as a housing rental, but wants to break the lease, for example because it t does not provide the minimum required things a person needs, like a freezer or a door that lock from the inside, would the lease be considered a legal contract like an apartment rental would be? How can someone get out of a boat lease? Do courts support the legality of a boat lease or would it be hard for a landlord to make a renter pay the full term for breaking the lease?",

Certainly not a specific-purpose appliance like a freezer.   \n\nA door that secures from the inside might be required.   \n\n&gt;Do courts support the legality of a boat lease\n\nVery probably yes, especially in places where liveaboard marinas, floating homes, and other types of floating on-water residences are common.",

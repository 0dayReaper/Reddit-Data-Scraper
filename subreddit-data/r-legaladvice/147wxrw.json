    "postText": "Experiencing Deja-vu at the moment because I have been dealing with a string of fraud against my aunt ever since my father died in September 2021 when I was 19. I am 20 going on 21 now. Still going through this. Still losing. I am so defeated. Contemplating on ending my life from how much she has taken from me. She successfully took one property (my father and I\u2019s home) and sold it, I have just found out today that she has gotten her claws into the last remaining property \u2014 my childhood home.\n\nMy dad passed away VERY unexpectedly without a will on September 3rd, 2021. He was healthy and working. He left behind two properties, his vehicle and $6k in his bank account. My aunt, as I said, took the first property. And now, she has used her daughter\u2019s name in transferring the deed from my dad\u2019s name. \n\nMy dad did not appoint her as anything before he died. He wasn\u2019t sick. No power of attorney. Nothing. Nothing at all. I was with him every single day. He told me everything. We were best friends.\n\nMy probate lawyer says that she filed a paper at the beginning of this year that was \u201ccreated\u201d on August 3rd 2021, exactly a month before my father passed away and that he came before her to transfer it to her name. She notarized it herself. And there\u2019s a signature from my dad but it\u2019s shaky and looks nothing like my father\u2019s signature. His signature was elegant and in cursive.\n\nThe only thing I will do right now is prove that he didn\u2019t sign it. I have signatures of his from August 3rd and forward. But how else can I prove fraud? I have a text from him that says he is going to the other house (the one in question) to meet with electricians and fix the hot water heater on the property after August 3rd, 2021. But I\u2019m illiterate when it comes to legal stuff and don\u2019t know if that is or will even hold up as proof or help at all. \n\nI\u2019m so defeated and my brain is muddled and I\u2019m giving up. I want my aunt to pay as I haven\u2019t had a good nights sleep since he died and since she\u2019s started tormenting my life and taking everything away from me. I\u2019m very fragile now. And emotionally distraught. Lawyers turn me away and tell me (even with fighting for the other property) that it isn\u2019t worth fighting for.\n\nPlease help me. I will go into debt trying to fight. I\u2019m desperate. I\u2019m so tired.",

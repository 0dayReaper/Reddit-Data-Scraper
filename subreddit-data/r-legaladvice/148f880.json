He has made no effort to follow up with any of that. \n\nWe\u2019ve also Recently we\u2019ve had a falling out and he\u2019s now saying i\u2019ll \u201cget it whenever he feels like giving me it\u201d. am i able to take this to small claims? Him saying that means he essentially won\u2019t pay me back, until he\u2019s not mad at me anymore which could be years as he\u2019s mentally unstable and has diagnosed BPD, among other mental issues. \n\nAny help would be appreciated thank you!",

Understand that this will probably end your relationship with your Dad. I'd send him a non-threatening note first saying that you are disappointed with him for not following up with his promise to pay you back. Give him one more chance and say that you have no other choice but to file in small claims court. This is so unfortunate and I wish you luck, hope you both can find a way to mend the relationship.",

    "postText": "Hello! I am located in central Florida, in December of 2021 my mother purchased a mobile home for cash and took over the lot rent for said home. Our rent checks have been cashed every single time and we sent them a letter of notice informing them that we took over the home. Yes, every single rent check has been cashed by them. \nToday I received a 3 day termination notice for failure to pay rent with the original tenants name on it.  It stated \u201che\u201d owed over $2300. I called the landlord no answer. I don\u2019t know what to do??? I\u2019m only 20 and am covering for my mother due to her having a stroke in December of last year. I\u2019m freaking out",

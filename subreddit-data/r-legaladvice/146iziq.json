    "postText": "During my sister\u2019s stay at the hospital due to respiratory problems a nurse turned off her ventilator. This happened two nights ago while we were both sleeping. A nurse that who wasn\u2019t even her nurse comes into her room and turns off her ventilator. My sister started having trouble breathing and wakes up. She thought it was just something acting up not that the ventilator was turned off since she was out of it. She said she tried to fall asleep and but couldn\u2019t because she started struggling a lot. She started to panic and called out to me. I finally woke up and she was saying she couldn\u2019t breathe. I was confused and was looking around. I see there was a nurse right in front of the ventilator between the bedside recliner where I was sleeping and my sister bed. She wasn\u2019t reacting at all. I look and see her ventilator is turned off. I immediately turned it back on. I was still out of it and confused. I kept asking her why was her ventilator turned off without informing us! I said she needs it to breathe! She just keeps saying no no no no. But I have no idea what she was talking about. After the commotion her actually nurse comes in and says Thuy I told you to turn off her feeding machine! I started to get a better idea of what was going on. Her feeding machine was alarming because it was finished. She somehow mistook a feeding machine from a ventilator. We filed a complaint already with patient relations. They got us in contact with the nurse manager. The nurse manager comes to meet us two days later to talk in person. But we start to realize they aren\u2019t taking this incident seriously and just want to sweep this under the rug. Even though they all admitted she could\u2019ve died that night if I wasn\u2019t there to turn it back on. Keep in mind my sister has a long history of medial problems and would\u2019ve never been able to turn it back on herself or even be able to scream loud enough for a different nurse to help. Initial we just wanted an incident report at least to be done but the nurse manager said she doesn\u2019t know if will be written. I asked her if we will be kept update if one done. She said no they will not be informing us if one is written or not. To me this sounds like they just want to keep down low.  Do we have any recourse here? The problem I see here is they all admitted what she did but if they decide to change their stories we have no proof of it. I was thinking about recording our conversation with the nurse manager where she states multiple times the nurse did it and she\u2019s sorry but California is a two party consent state. But realistically how do we prove this if they don\u2019t admit to anything and there not even an incident report. My sister now wants file a malpractice claim. But realistically idk how successful it would be. I just feel so bad for her because all her life she\u2019s been ill and now the people that\u2019s relying on to help her almost killed her then swept it under the rug like it never happened.  \n\nThere\u2019s just so many questions on how a nurse mistakes a feeding machine for a ventilator. Also to turn off her ventilator you have to hold the power button then a large red button on screen says ventilator shutoff needs to be pressed. Her ventilator is so loud from the air flow. How could she not hear ventilator being turned off and react. Why did she stand by the whole time while my sister would calling for me and saying I can\u2019t breathe without reacting at all? \n\nI\u2019m not really sure where to go from here, when they person that suppose to be overseeing isn\u2019t doing anything about it.\n\nEDIT:\nDamages: Physically a little weaker,harder trouble breathing that her doctor noted but nothing extreme. Most of the damages were avoided because I was there to turn it back on. Mentally I think she\u2019s far worse than she\u2019s been before but I\u2019m not sure that even comes into play in these things. It seems malpractice is out of the picture but I\u2019d thought I would ask because that\u2019s what she wants to look into. I\u2019m just looking for some sort of recourse against this nurse that potentially could\u2019ve killed her.\n\n\nEDIT: \nI\u2019ve just been so busy with everything that has been going on that I haven\u2019t had a chance to respond to the comments and private messages. I appreciate everyone\u2019s help and concerned. I just showed my sister the post and I think she was happy that a lot of people seem to care about her situation. We will definitely be pursuing this more. As people have suggested malpractice isn\u2019t the right course for this but we will following all the other avenues people have suggested. She will have her voice heard.",

If the nurse manager is willing to hide this for her and the nurse said she didn\u2019t turn it off? Her actually nurse  may speak on our behalf which I\u2019m not sure if she will. Will that even matter since she wasn\u2019t in the room at the time to physically see the nurse turning it off?",

Likely the RN wrote a brief note in the chart about the incident. \n\nIncident reports are private and not available to families or others. We are trained not to acknowledge they exists to keep them out of court. They are meant to be internal reports to encourage improvements in patient safety.

I review a good amount of cases in this realm and the cases that win are the ones with *bad* outcomes \u2014 permanent deficit, death, long term disability, loss of income, etc. If OP\u2019s sister genuinely has disability after this event due to PTSD, then I\u2019m sure a lawyer would take a look at this case but I still believe it would be challenging to prove in a jury trial. More often than not, even if the medical team truly fucked up, the jury will still rule in favor of the defendant.\n\nThis is not to disparage OP\u2019s sister or anyone with PTSD. I feel for them, especially if your life is in someone\u2019s hands and they make an unacceptable mistake.",

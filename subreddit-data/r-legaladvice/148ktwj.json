    "postText": "Hi there, I am a resident based in Toronto, Ontario and I am seeking legal advice regarding a private medical clinic specializing in optometry. In 2020, I was diagnosed with severe dry eye and my doctor recommended the use of scleral lenses. I paid upfront for a package on May 31st, 2020, which included the fitting, assessment, and the lenses, totaling approximately $2500.  \nUnfortunately, to this day, I have not received the lenses and have been refused further treatment. I would like to outline the issues I have encountered:  \n1. Pricing Agreement: The clinic's manager informed me that I was not asked to sign an agreement initially, which apparently indicated that the price I paid did not include the lenses themselves (priced at $560). According to them, I was required to pay an additional $560 after receiving the 7th assessment. If I don't pay for it, the amount I have paid will not be refundable. They were 'sorry' that the reception forgot to ask me to sign it.  \n2. Visit Limitations and Additional Fees: The manager also informed me that the package I purchased only included 6 visits, and any additional visits would cost $180 each. This information was apparently explained in the agreement, which I was not made aware of prior to making the payment. Consequently, during my 7th visit, I was informed that the money I had paid was non-refundable, and therefore, I had to continue with the treatment. The clinic offered to continue the assessments out of mercy.  \n3. Failure to Provide Lenses: After over 20 visits spanning two years, the clinic informed me that they were unable to find a suitable pair of lenses for me. They suggested I seek the assistance of another optometrist within the clinic and offered a discounted price of $2100 (originally $4200). However, when I consulted other clinics, I learned that the doctor should determine the feasibility of fitting the lenses during the first initial appointment, and typically, the fitting process takes only 3-6 visits to complete. Furthermore, the doctor is no longer employed at the clinic, which has merged with another entity due to financial losses. The current management claims they are not responsible for any previous commitments and can only offer a refund of $1200 for the completed 6 visits.  \nI would greatly appreciate any advice or guidance you can provide. Thank you in advance for your assistance.",

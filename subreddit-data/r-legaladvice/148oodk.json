    "postText": "I have in the past, and recently, done some camming work as a side-job. I'm seriously considering quitting this specific line of work. However, I just googled (out of curiosity) my camsite username, and found some sort of alarming things. Screenshots and recordings of my live shows (with my face and full body showing) are plastered on multiple websites. Most of these websites seem to be covered by a pay-wall or \"sign up for free trial to watch\" sort of thing, but google images shows all you really need to see. I knew the risks of showing my full face/body online, but found that the income was worth it at first. Young and dumb. Now, I'm having some regrets and honestly, I'm scared to death.\n\nI am /not/ super popular on any big camsite or adult website, but it still makes me nervous that intimate pictures and videos of myself are thrown across the internet now. My legal name is not attached to any of them as far as I can see, but if someone was to recognize me or find out that information... well, you get the gist. \n\nI looked through this sub briefly to see if there were any other camgirl situations, and from what I saw it looks like I might be out of luck. So, what can I even do? Is there anything I can do? I'm very unfamiliar with my rights as a sex worker, including DMCA, content rights, all of that. I am also not rich by any means (hence why I got into this line of work), so I do not have excess cash to spend on the best legal team. \n\nIf you have any advice, or know who I could talk to to get some, I would be VERY grateful. Thank you so, so much.",

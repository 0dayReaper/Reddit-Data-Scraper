One of them is emotionally disturbed by my presence as her dad has used her a surrogate spouse for years and there is some emotional incest going on. I am sick of it. He continues to pretend as if he\u2019s making attempts to reconcile with me when in reality he\u2019s only wishing to push his responsibility with kids off on me. \n\nHistory is that these kids were the cause of our divorce and their bio mom is a POS who gets off on anyone else except her taking care of her kids. Seeming like dad is too. What can I do? I have already made a CPS complaint but it wasn\u2019t investigated and bio parents tried to sue me over it.",

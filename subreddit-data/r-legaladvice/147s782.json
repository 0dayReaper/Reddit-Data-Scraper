    "postText": "Sadly, I recently lost my father and we did not know about an old will that was greater than 50 years old.  Lawyers have vaults.  In this will, I am excluded after years of my father stating that he would leave everything to me and my kids.  In fact, the will leaves a sizable portion to his brother who he detested and have not spoken to in decades.  I have spoken to the other relatives and they want everything go to me as intended.  \r  \n\r  \nBut there is a reason that my uncle is detested, I spoke to my uncle directly and he told that he was keeping it out of spite.   \r  \n\r  \nI spoke to a probate attorney and he said my case was not good and to look after my health.  Sage advice. \r  \n\r  \nNow, I don\u2019t need the money. It is not what my father would want. \r  \n\r  \nIs there any advice on contesting the will?  One issue is that the witnesses cannot be found. \r  \n\r  \n",

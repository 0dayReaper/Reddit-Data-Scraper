    "postText": "So this all started last month. I received a civil summons for child support to a family members address that I used to stay at. It was basically informing me that someone filed a child support case against me. There\u2019s no court date or anything that I\u2019m aware of, but I wanted to be proactive so I called the attorney general\u2019s office that sent it to me. I ended up getting transferred to a detective who told me that they wouldn\u2019t send that in the mail. I gave her the case number and the first name is spelled different than mine but we have the same middle initial and last name. We have different social security numbers, different birthdays, different dads, our dads birthdays are different. She told me that she\u2019s pretty sure this isn\u2019t me and asked me to return the mail to her (it was one of those things you stick on door knobs) and she would get to the bottom of it and give me a call back, but I haven\u2019t heard anything back yet. \n\nAbout a week and a half ago, I received another piece of mail from an assistant attorney called a \u201cNotice of Remand\u201d basically saying \u201cthe undersigned is remanding its motion to set child support filed on March 29, 2023 under the grounds\u201d: and then it lists some stuff about how the petitioner was receiving KTAP, is no longer receiving KTAP, and they haven\u2019t requested that a child support be set in this matter. Also the name for the petitioner is someone I\u2019ve never met in my life.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m not sure if I should worry about this or not. I would call again but I basically have to take off work to do this because it takes a couple hours on hold to reach them. Last time it took me 2 hours to reach someone and then another 15 minutes after getting transferred. And I\u2019m not in the best financial situation to take off work! Any help or advice  is appreciated.",

Second, when you say you received it, did you receive it in your correct name? Or did someone else with a civil summons have their civil summons sent to your address?",

It\u2019s like one of those things that you hang on someone\u2019s door. The second thing that was sent a week and a half ago, the notice of remand, was an actual piece of mail in an envelope. \n\nThe both pieces  had my first name spelled wrong by one letter (my name is devin but they spelled it Devon) and we have the same middle initial and last name. \n\nIn my theory after speaking to the detective, I think I received someone else\u2019s civil summons, though I\u2019m not exactly sure why it went to my old address (family member\u2019s house.) When I spoke to the detective a month ago that works in the attorney general\u2019s office that the civil summons was sent from, we found out my ssn, birthday, dads name and birthday are all different.",

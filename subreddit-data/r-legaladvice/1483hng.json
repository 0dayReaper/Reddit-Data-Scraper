    "postText": "My GF and I rent an attached house in PA and have her son (8M) full time and my kids (14M, 11M, 8F) on weekends and all summer.  Our neighbor (Who owns) has been smoking marijuana with her new BF constantly.  I know they both have their med cards (They've told us multiple times) but it is getting ridiculous.  It is now to the point where we can't be in the garage at all because the lack of insulation between the houses allows the smoke to get through and it is now getting into the first floor of our house.  It's becoming a serious issue now because at least 4 days a week it absolutely reeks of weed in my house and just to check and make sure I'm not blowing this out of proportion I took a home drug test and came back positive for THC.  We can't afford to move out or break the lease and I'm worried that my Ex will try and take the kids for a bad environment.  I can't even call the police because they're legally entitled to their medical weed.  The ONLY positive in this is that my landlord has been over when they were smoking and smelled it getting into the house and he is aware that it's not us that are smoking it.  Do I have any recourse here or do I just have to live with it until I can move?",

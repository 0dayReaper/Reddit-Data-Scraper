    "postText": "My gf and I(M) just got a letter saying she has court in another state on a Wednesday I work Thursday thru Saturday pretty much all day and I'm panicking because I wont have anyway to look after our kid due to lack of time off options and I don't know if there are any LoA open to cover the time needed to care for my daughter. The case is about a misdemeanor idk what that means for me or my kid if that means she'll be taken away or not because on her birth certificate there is no name under father. I guess the goal of this post is to get help about what I can possibly do to get a leave of sorts to be able to care for my daughter while she goes and gets that taken care of.",

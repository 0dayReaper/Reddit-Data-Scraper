I want to force partition sale on my sister and make 300-400 thousand buckaroos, woohoo. I can literally force her to buy my share of the home in court? How much will I owe in taxes? Its in cape code Massachusetts, we've never lived in the home if it matters, and were gonna be renting it out. Some guy already lived there to work on the house for a couple of years, not sure what other info I need to place here, ask away for more details to help fill me in. I'm also curious on an estimate with court fees, thanks.",

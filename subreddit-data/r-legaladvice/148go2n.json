    "postText": "In Texas : \nI live in a condo association and the unit next to me is needing foundation repairs. That falls under my HOA to make such repairs; however, according to the bylaws everything studs in is the responsibility of the owner. The laws don\u2019t account for it during repair the HOA were to damage my property. They forced me to sign documents allowing the repairs by threatening to fine me. Do I have any legal right to sue them for damaging my property if that occurs during the repairs?",

You can always ask them to show you what rule you\u2019re breaking that they could fine you for. \n\nBut if you already signed it then no you couldn\u2019t sue.",

Our bylaws just state that the interior of the property is the homeowners responsibility, which is standard for condos, but not what happens in the event that the HOA\u2019s construction would damage my property. They\u2019re using the fact the bylaws state that the interior is my responsibility even if they damage it",

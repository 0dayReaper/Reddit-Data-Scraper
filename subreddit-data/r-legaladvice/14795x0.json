    "postText": "My grandmother passed away on Thursday, June 8th, at the age of 86. My mother recently found out that my aunt had my grandfather help her sister acquire a personal loan in the amount of $12,000 using his property as collateral. My grandfather is 86 years old and he gave the title of his home to the person who provided the loan.\n\nThe loan was made by a person not a bank and the document was notarized.  Property located in the state of Florida and notarized in the state of Florida.\n\nVerbiage of the loan agreement:\n\nFIRST: The lender(s) lent the amount of $12,000 to the borrower(s) under the following terms. Lender(s) delivers a cashier's check for the agreed amount to the borrow(s) on May 27th, 2022.\n\nSECOND. Borrow(s) agreed to pay 8% of monthly interest on any owed amount.\n\nTHIRD. Borrower(s) agreed to pay back monthly the amount of $667 plus the specified interest, every 27th day of each month for 18 months.\n\nFOURTH \\[states where and how payment should be made\\]\n\nFIFTH. Borrower(s) agreed that lender will hold the common stock certificate for 18 months. And if borrowers fail to pay, the whole amount of $12,000 plus the interest due on the specified term of 18 months, then borrowers agreed to transfer to the lender the common stock certificate with partial number###. Located at address ABC Lane St and waive any right that the borrowers, or any of his/her heirs could have on the common stock. If for any legal reason, the transfer option is not available, then borrowers agreed to pay back any amount due to lender from the sale of the common stock share before any profit distribution to the borrowers or the borrower's heirs.\n\nMy question is the following: Is this document legal? Why or why not? Is it legal to charge 8% interest on a monthly basis ($960 a month) and add an additional $667 for a total amount of $1,627 a month for 18 months ($29,286 total pay off)?\n\nThank you in advance for your response and thank you for taking the time to respond.",

Unless it's meaning that the lender now has an interest in the home equal to $whatevertheloanwas. Even so, the laws of joint ownership for homes is weird.\nWhole thing seems weird. \nGet a lawyer.",

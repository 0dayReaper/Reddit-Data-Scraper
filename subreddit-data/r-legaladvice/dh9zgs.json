They question me, scream at me, coerce me to stand, pressure me by implying I disrespect my country and troops, and the handbook implies punishment if i dont stand for the pledge. This is illegal. Where do I go from here? Does anyone know how other students have done this in the past? Thanks",

Barnette*, and in **1943** the US Supreme Court ruled that refusing to stand for the Pledge or national anthem was a First Amendment right.

Here is how I think you should proceed:\n\n1. Have a parent write a note regarding your abstention and bring it to administration. This generally solves the problem, as most schools do not advertise this but parents can opt students out of almost any rule like this (also out of public school uniforms, field trips, any \"required\" purchase, and so on).\n\n2. Provide evidence regarding the Barnette case and show them you have the local ACLU phone number on hand.\n\n3. Call the local ACLU chapter.\n\nYou CAN be punished for behavior that infringes on learning or disrupts a safe learning environment, so your abstention should be quiet and calm. All debates and discussions about this should take place in an office and be recorded or documented.\n\nEdit NAL but am teacher and conlaw researcher\nChicago branch ACLU: +13122019740 Opens 830am Monday\n\nEdit also sorry Tinker v. Des Moines- ruling explicitly protects student protest against government actions or institutions at school (as long as not disruptive and public school).",

This way, when they suspect student for 5 late-to-class instances, they can point to the signed handbook to say, \"you knew the rules.\"\n\nI strongly suspect there is no specific line that says \"you must stand for the pledge\" in anything, but if there is, it still doesn't mean anything, since you cannot contract away your rights (with certain specific exceptions, and scenarios that isn't applicable here).\n\nSo you can fight this, but I suggest you consult with your parents because their support is VERY helpful (regardless of your age, as long as you attend primary school, your parents have many more powers in this realm).  Also, I would print out a simple single page explanation from cornell/aclu/other trustworthy online source and bring it with you to hand out to teachers/admins. Don't argue with the teachers, just make a simple statement:\"it is my right not to stand for the pledge, and I choose not to stand for the pledge.\"  If they keep arguing with you, keep repeating the exact same line, don't argue their points (which are likely appeals to authority, appeals to emotion, or other logical nonsequitors to this situation), just repeat your statement. Remember people don't like to be told they're wrong, and they'll try to find other ways to punish you for bruising their ego, so keep it simple, and don't give them anything to use.",

Start with your teachers. Then move to the assistant principal in charge of discipline, then the principal then the superintendent.\nWhile you are meeting with them mention that this is in direct violation of your right to free speech (in this case not making a speech). \n If all of that fails call the ACLU. They will take care of this for you. The case that went before the Supreme Court, decided in 1943, involved a student who was a Jehovah's Witness. The case was name West Virginia v. Barnette. To quote two members of the court (Hugo Black and William Douglas \"words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest...Love of country must spring from willing heart's and free minds.\"\nYou may make a stronger impression with instructors/ administration if you do a little research and demonstrate that you possess skilled argument techniques. You might even imply that your education in their school system taught you those skills. \nBest of luck to you. You are brave and what makes our country great.",

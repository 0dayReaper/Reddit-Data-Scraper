    "postText": "I accidentally took off a car\u2019s mirror trying to parallel park on a busy street, and pulled over to to an adjacent lot to get my information ready. A kid in some uniform on a bicycle came up to me and informed me that the other car sped away and that someone from the bar across the street called the police about the incident. Two cops showed up a few minutes later and I gave them my info and explained what happened. The cop was quite kind and told me that since they left the scene I was free to go and didn\u2019t need to follow up. \n\nA week later a woman calls me and leaves a message claiming that she\u2019s who I hit and that she\u2019s at the body shop right now and is curious why I didn\u2019t file a claim\u2026Then my insurance called and I explained the details. \n\nEverything is covered through my insurance, but the damage the other party is claiming seems a lot more than what I believe to have happened. And since they left I had no way to verify this\u2026(also begs the question as to why they left in the first place \ud83d\udea8)\n\nDid I do everything I could in this situation? Anything I should have done that I should do if this happens again? \n\nThanks (this was my first accident and I live in the US)",

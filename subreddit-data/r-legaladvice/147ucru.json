    "postText": "I'm trying to figure out if I should put this claim through my insurance or not.\n\nI was turning right without a light onto a street, and a driver came up behind me (i think speeding) and tried to swerve to avoid me. Only thing I'm definitely guilty of is that I didn't turn right into the rightmost lane. But, he purposely sped up to try to avoid me instead  of slow down when there would have been plenty of time to not hit me. \n\nThe lane he moved into ended at the exact place he tried to swerve and he ended up hitting my drivers side mirror off as well as his own because he didn't have enough room to get around me. I just got quoted between 1K-3K to fix the damages on my car and am wondering if it's worth it to go through insurance or if it would raise my premium a ton and wouldn't be worth it. And then also I guess wondering who's fault that is. He is not insured and also did not have his license on him. \n\nI didn't call the police at the scene which may have been stupid but he was a young kid and I didn't want to get him in trouble for not having a license on him or insurance for no reason (also didn't think it would be as expensive as i've been quoted) ",

It sounds like you turned into the wrong lane, but it also sounds like the other driver may have recklessly tried to get around you. \n\nBut it really doesn't matter. Just report it to your insurance, and don't worry about it. And if your jurisdiction requires a police or accident report, make sure to do that, too.",

One guesses the other driver is going not raise a liability claim for his mirror.  In that case where your insurance is already going to know you were at fault in an accident, it makes sense to ask your agent how your claim with additionally affect the premium impact.",

Their lack of insurance etc. does not change this.\n\nIf you don't want to foot the whole bill for your car and his out of pocket you need to notify your insurance.\n\nYou also likely have a legal obligation to report the accident to the police.   Most jurisdictions have requirements that if the damage is over a certain threshold you have to file a police report.",

            "comment": "It doesn't really even matter who is at fault. You didn't call the police. Generally for damages that high, your insurance won't cover if you don't file a police report (mine is anything over $500, I think, but I'm sure the exact amount varies). You could still file a police report, and you might be deemed not to be at fault depending on your state's laws, but it's much muddier when you wait to do so, since there can be more variation in reports of what happened, if you even have the other driver's information. You're going to have to either explain to your insurance company why you didn't report it and risk being deemed at fault or pay for the repairs on your own.",

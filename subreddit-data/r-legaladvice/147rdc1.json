    "postText": "So in colorado. My car was towed at 4:30am I was awake, noticed he by my car, yelled I'm stickered. Went down to him driving away, while I was yelling to stop and flashing the lights on my car. My car is registered with a sticker to those apartments, has been since the beginning. I saw in co that if im there they cant tow away my car, that happened. I go, okay whatever. It's 464 dollars, including a 96 dollar fee for getting it \"after hours\" (8am Sunday while they are obviously open) and a $75 \"notification fee\" no idea what that is, they didn't say. When I first got there I said I want to pay the 15% and get my car back because new colorado law, they refused saying I needed a manager and that isn't there problem is one isn't there. I said okay that's illegal but pay it all I need my car. They then refused and said come back with a better attitude. I call 911 because they're illegally holding my car, I wait 1 hour 15 minutes for police to show up. Police never show up. I go back up say I'm not doing this anymore take my card or I'm leaving and a lawyer can deal with this and any extra fees. I get my car, my sticker that was on my dash in on the floor now, but that shouldnt matter if they needed the landlords authorizationto tow it and theyre suppose to leave a 24 hour notice, no notice., tried talking to a Manager at the tow shop today. No answer, same goes for calling my landlords. What am I suppose to do? Or am I just in the wrong because my sticker fell onto the floor.",

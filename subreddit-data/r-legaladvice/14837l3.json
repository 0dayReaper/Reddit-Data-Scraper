    "postText": "In November 2022 I began working with a small start-up company. 90% of the staff was hired as contractors instead of standard employees although we\u2019d all been working nonstop Monday to Sunday for the last 8months. Recently they CEO embezzled money from the company which led to the investors cutting a deal with the CEO to refund all their invested money ($3million) &amp; dissolving the company. However all the employees including myself are just left out to dry with no severance package or anything. Is there anything we can do about this legally? I believe it\u2019s extremely unfair that we\u2019ve that been working tirelessly to get this company off the ground. Only to have it dissolved &amp; all be let go for something we took no part in. Feels like we\u2019re the only ones getting screwed in this deal.",

This is file for unemployment and find a new job territory.",

    "postText": "So my (F21) parents own a home across several lots of land in North Carolina. They inherited the home and property from my grandparents. This is not our primary home, and we only visit a few times a year.\n\nIn our area there has been a lot of construction taking place in the lots surrounding ours, particularly along one side of our property, where they are building a home on the thin plot of land next door.\n\nThe owners of the company that will own the home talked with my parents about trimming down longstanding hedges that cross over the property line. My parents talked with the owners of the company and walked the property line with them, and told them explicitly that they could thin out the hedge and cut down their side if they so desired, but to avoid cutting down our muscadine vines, which were also growing on a clothesline imbedded in the hedge.\n\nMy grandparents planted these vines over 20 years ago, and they were heavily ingrained into the hedge. \n\nI arrived at the property yesterday, and lo and behold, the entire hedge has been cut to the ground. The trees, the bushes, and the entirety of our vines. \n\nWe talked with the owners of the company, and they claimed that when they went to cut the trees out of the hedge (some of which were majority on our side of the property line) it pulled everything with it, so they just tore everything out. \n\nI can see tiny little \u201cstumps\u201d of where the vines used to be, and they have clearly been cut that low to the ground. They are at least 3-4 feet on our side of the line.\n\nIs there anything I can do here to sue for damages, or anything at all?",

    "postText": "When Finn was first revealed, there was a massive wave of hate due to being a black stormtrooper (even though stormtroopers are recruits not clones). Like some really vile stuff. \n\nNow the fanbase has done a 180 and near universally likes Finn and dislikes how Lucasfilm treated his character (especially in TLJ).\n\nFind it interesting how people can evolve their viewpoints",

It's true that there's a very small faction of toxic  ....and loud... fans but they were inflated into something much larger by Disney's PR people. Disney twisted their toxicity so as to alter public opinion into thinking; \"If you don't like the movie you must be a bigot.\" \n\nPeople have also evolved from their dislike of the character to  a recognition that it was actually poor writing/storytelling on Disney's part. Disney/Lucasfilm is at fault not Finn/Boyega. \n\nI think those toxic fans, and Disney's use of them as a tool to insulate themselves from criticism, are part of the reason Star Wars has been suffering from a failure to fix things. They group the toxic fans with all the other disappointed fans.",

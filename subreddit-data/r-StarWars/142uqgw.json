            "comment": "Darth Maul's early life was full of trauma. He was separated from his birth family and raised (and renamed) with his blood brothers Feral and Savage Opress. At a very early age, he was taken by Darth Sidious, who abused and groomed him into an angry, violent weapon.\n\nDarth Vader's history is similar in that he begins with separation from his birth mother and being raised in the monastic Jedi Temple. Eventually, Darth Sidious spotted his psychological issues and his Force-wielding potential and started grooming him, too.\n\nGiven the Jedi tendency to permanently separate children from their families, it's surprising that they don't have even more psychological powder kegs (thermal detonators?) running around. While some will benefit from the structure and support in the monastic order, at least a few others are going to have lifelong separation issues.",

They can become balls of wrath\u2026 or they can become completely detached, with an almost zen-like indifference to suffering and a profound compassion for others in the name of giving them better than they received. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the Jedi are not supposed to be seen as psychologically healthy. They take the idea of detachment to the extreme, to the point of separating children far too early, just as the Sith take \u201caccept your feelings and passions\u201d way too far.",

There's definitely a lot more than just this, but a lot of the deep-rooted trauma I'm talking I have seen in child abuse victims. I wonder if it actually helps separating some.",

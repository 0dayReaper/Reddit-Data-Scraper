The battle of Mimban, the boots on the ground in the trenches look at the Imperial war machine is something I've found Star Wars to be severely lacking. If Rogue One's third act was akin to Space Vietnam (Apocalypse Now's helicopter assault comes to mind), the Solo was Space WWI in a visceral way. Honestly if Disney was willing to churn out more war stories in Star Wars, I would keep going back again and again. \n\nIt was very much a moment of \"show not tell\" when it came to the Empire's effect on the galaxy that I adored.",

In the lore the Imperial Army is the majority of Imperial ground forces but Stormtroopers are always more famous and distinctive anyways. You kinda see them in the background in IV, they show up a bit more in V driving the walkers and commanding the Hoth assault then they show up in VI as walker drivers again. It's one of the small things that kinda annoys me, because even in Lucas' own story notes the Imperial war machine is so much more.\n\nAh well, I still loved that sequence.",

A somewhat flawed analogy would be that they were the US Marine Corps to the US Army. They were either always on expeditionary status, in active combat or in training to do so. The Imperial Army by contrast garrisoned worlds and provided the meat of an assault. Stormtroopers were the tip of the spear, the Imperial Army was the hands thrusting them forward.\n\nIf there were Stormtroopers on your planet, they were there to crush an insurgency.",

Though interestingly Nazi Germany as a whole moved away from the Imperial Stormtrooper doctrine, preferring to use armored spearheads to drive forward and prevent trench lines from being established against them anyways. Not to say they didn't exist, the Brandenburg Division originally started that way but became more analogous to covert operations troops that ended up ahead of the main advance to seize critical objectives, something SW Stormtroopers had in the form of Storm Commandos and other specialized units that worked for Imperial Intelligence and the ISB. The Brandenburg Division would also work as special ops forces for the Abewehr, which was German military intelligence, (the Imperial Intelligence equivalent). The ISB is similar to the SS' intelligence apparatus and the domestic intelligence apparatus who's name escapes me.\n\nSorry for the incoherent ramble, I'm fairly deep in my cups at the moment and this aspect of the SW lore is something I rather enjoyed when I was younger.",

To elaborate a bit further, I consider the Stormtrooper Corps to be party loyalists that receive operational level orders from each of the armed forces, but I have always felt that the Stormtroopers were also there to keep the other armed forces in line and enforce loyalty. I think the Stormtroopers Corps is probably limited in their organization and support, I don't suspect they have the type of logistics, command and control, heavy artillery, etc. that the Imperial Army would have. I see the Stormtroopers on Mimban as likely a smaller unit attached to a larger Imperial Army force (maybe a Regiment within a Division, for example).",

In Episode IV it's remarked that Palpatine had or was going to dissolve the Senate entirely and have the Moffs and Grand Moffs, who had previously shared power, take over that role entirely. \n\nThat being said, it makes total sense that if a unit was suspected of being compromised, it was the Stormtroopers who were called in to deal with them.",

Overtime casualties and clones aging out diluted the quality, this was further compounded by the Emperor wanting even more stormtrooper units because they've morphed into symbolic terror units.",

With that in mind, the common connotations of the word Stormtrooper was with the Imperial German Army of WWI and the Paramilitary wings of the Nazi Party that became the SS and Waffen-SS.\n\nThis isn't totally born out by reality, as the SS and Waffen-SS had a reputation for variable quality troops just like the Wehrmacht but the common perception of them was as ideologically loyal and ultimately zealous, something that going further into would go down the whole of the SS Bad, Wehrmacht good propaganda pushed in the post WWII era.\n\nTo bring a somewhat confusing ramble home, the Imperial Army had soldiers superior to Imperial Stromtroopers within them, but the Stormtroopers were far more ideologically loyal to the Empire, where as the Imperial Army was in many cases local planetary forces that were absorbed into the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Also noted, the Stormtrooper recruiting criteria required a higher level of ideological loyalty to be considered for training and it was further reinforced in cases with brainwashing.",

The Galactic Republic had, as part of the Ruusan Reformation, abolished their centralized military in favor of planet, system and sector militias to supplement a federal force of Judicials, who were more of a federal police with SWAT equivalents. A major point in the prelude to Episode I in the EU was Grand Moff Tarkin's father being an advocate for re-militarization to combat growing piracy, notably joining the militia forces he commanded with other systems and sectors to create a sort of adhoc military.\n\nCome to Episode II and the Clone Army provides the elite forces of the greater Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), being literally bred to fight. The other militias and forces got absorbed into the GAR gradually as part of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's increasing centralization of power and military force.\n\nAs part of the Declaration of the New Order at the end of Episode III, these subordinate forces were absorbed pretty much at gunpoint into the Imperial war machine and constitute the greater Imperial Army.

Tagge was the one who raises the idea of what if the rebels had found something. In V, Veers was Imperial Army, he had Stormtroopers under his command because Death Squadron was a joint service organization but he was Imperial Army. In both legends and the new canon, Imperial walker pilots fell under the Imperial Army's mechanized command.\n\nPlus a fair bit of it can be chalked up to inconsistencies created by Lucas' limited budget and need to reuse props, with them being fleshed out through the comparatively cheaper medium of writing.",

The Death Star as a whole was a joint service environment as well but there is no denying the Stormtroopers took center stage in the film for the Empire. After all, they are quite visually distinctive as opposed to the greys, greens, dark blues and blacks of the more formal uniforms of the other services. It's almost like the Pentagon, the hoard of functionaries in semi formals blend together in the background, especially compared to any people in full kit with weapons in open view.",

Han isn't trying to topple this grand Empire. He really doesn't care much about them. They're just the government/police force that's part of the backdrop of this setting, similar to the role of the Union and Confederacy in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\n\nThat's one thing I really liked about the Martez arc in Clone Wars. It showed more of the civilian side of the Republic, and the Clone Troopers/Grand Army of the Republic were just the military in the background. I love when established universes take a step back from the factions we're so familiar with and show how ordinary people in that universe view them (often with little knowledge of what those factions actually do, whereas the audience obviously knows more about them.)",

I\u2019m kind of glad they took a step back and started doing more small screen stuff, although I\u2019m sure the pandemmy helped usher that in.\n\nIn my ideal world, we get a new trilogy every 15 years, like normal.

You would have thought it was worse than the Christmas Special. The TLJ hate was dying down but it was still simmering (and yeah, I was disappointed in that too) so all Solo really seemed to do was bring that same pot back to a boil. Now that enough time has passed I'm seeing a bunch of appreciation and \"why the hate?\" posts which makes me very happy to see it get some recognition. \n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't say it's the strongest of the Disney era movies but it had just enough fan service, fleshed out the existing universe, recanonized some stuff that was considered Legacy (that was a concern of fans at the time, if they were going to just toss the entire EU and avoid it, or slowly reincorporate elements that still worked), and finally was quite simply *fun*. \n\nEven at the time I felt it was the timing of the release and I feel vindicated in that because as we move further from its release the movie is getting more and more love. \n\nWho knows though, maybe the reddit algorithms just figured out I liked the movie so my front-page is filled with positive posts about it and hides the hate now skewing my opinion of public opinion. That's not outside the realm of reality.",

We just had directors/writers having dick measuring contests with each other. Trying to retcon what the other did before them.",

They chose to spend their money on Infinity War and Deadpool 2 instead. Which they had more confidence in. \n\nThese same people go bananas for The Mandalorian and can\u2019t get enough. There\u2019s no fatigue. When things are done right, you want more.",

Its that he is still exactly the same person as we left off in ROTJ. Its been decades. He changed and grew a TON in the original trilogy, great arc. In 7, all these years later, he's just ANH Ham Solo again. Its weird and lazy writing.\n\nLuke was the opposite. \"I have to help my friends\" and thinking he can find enough good to convert the literal dark lord of the galaxy that murdered millions in cold blood. But his student gets a little angsty and suddenly Luke is a would be child murderer?\n\nThe order wouldnt have saved anything imo",

I don't believe we've seen much of Corellia in the various live action or animated shows, and there's far more of Imperial-run Coruscant left to be shown.

Part of the reason Rogue One is my favourite modern Star Wars movie is because it's not trying too hard to be a part of the big main story.\n\nThe question I wish people making these side movies would ask themselves is: \"if I strip away the veneer of familiarity than any Star Wars movie has, is this story worth telling?\"\n\nTo me, the answer with Rogue One is a resounding yes. It's a story about how complicated liberation movements are. The difficult and sometimes unethical choices that have to be made for them to succeed, the ideological splits within them and the perseverance of hope over cynicism. The split between Saw and the main faction is one that is mirrored in almost every popular struggle. Yes it hits some familiar notes - the Death Star, X-wings, ending as episode 4 begins, but those are what ties it in, not what is fundamentally about.\n\nSolo by contrast is just a bit too reliant on the fan service I feel.",

Meeting Chewbacca was great.  Getting his name was a very amusing part.  Getting a first glimpse of the falcon was wonderful, and learning why the falcon's computer has a \"peculiar dialect\" was a treat.  Even hearing Lando reference the Mindharp of Sharu was a blast. But we sure didn't need to see Han get his gun (which,  come on,  it's a gun), make the Kessel run (which was a disappointing interpretation of it IMO), break the falcon enough that it looks *just like it does in ep 4*, win it in the card game, and oh yeah,  make sure we see Han be connected to the beginning of the rebellion. \n\nSo much of that should have been left for further stories. The Falcon getting beaten up should take years of desperate situations.  Getting jaded enough to just *krispa Greedo* should happen over time.  Going to work for Jabba didn't have to be the very next thing he does. I mean seriously,  who has a life changing formative experience over a few weeks and then never changes for the rest of their life?  Or even just 10 years?",

Han's reaction to having to shoot Beckett is emotional and wrenching. Han's reaction to shooting Greedo is that of a tired, jaded veteran who barely sees Greedo as a person (probably for his own emotional/mental defense, but still). The scene that you think is a perfect set up for the Han we meet in the original movie just feels too pat to me. The implication there is that the one instance of having to defend himself from his friend broke him so thoroughly that he is instantly the borderline sociopath we see in Mos Eisley at the start of his redemption arc. I just think it would be storytelling more to my taste to see these developments over a longer timeframe. It's just a matter of opinion. If you liked it,  that's really cool,  and I'm glad it worked for you. \n\nRegardless, my points were more to illustrate the tendency of prequels to hit an entire checklist of all significant aspects of a character's history, filling in every detail in one compact package, leaving you with a finished product that then basically remains in stasis for however much time is to pass between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original appearance.  I like to think that people continue to evolve over time,  not just over a single adventure. \n\nThat seems to be exactly what they did with Solo,  with the added bonus of the unnecessary additions of a) connecting Han to the rebellion from the beginning (a terrible tendency to connect all significant characters in Star Wars so closely that it makes a sprawling world seem unbelievably small) and b) and \"oh yeah,  we almost forgot to tie up his connection to Jabba the Hutt,  so here it is\".\n\nIn the end,  I enjoyed Solo, and loved Alden Ehrenreich's portrayal,  but I wish we could have seen a series of Han's adventures that covered these formative events over a longer stretch of time (likewise,  I would have preferred to see Darth Vader's conversion from a healthy Anankin to the bionic monster in life support armor be the result of many encounters with the jedi he's been hunting,  instead of the result of one big fight with obi wan - is a thing with me,  I guess).\n\nPeace fellow fan.

Beckett was the snowball at the top of a very big hill.

I didn\u2018t have a good taste in my mouth for the franchise at the time it came out and I was pissed that the franchise wanted to pick at a part of Star Wars that I considered fully and satisfyingly closed. \n\nI loved seeing Han Solo in TFA, and I hated seeing him die, but it felt good and right as a conclusion to the character. On the heels of this fully satisfying send-off, we had The Last Jedi, which was weird because it was a franchise installment without Han Solo, and also because it was totally unsatisfying in terms of characters we cared about. (\u201cHere\u2019s Luke, but he has regressed to being a whiner! Here\u2019s Rey, and we\u2019re stoked to see where she came from where she came from, but we\u2019re told it doesn\u2019t matter! Here\u2019s Finn, who got sent off on some bizarre sidequest with some random new person!\u201d) So at that point, Han Solo was one of not many things in the franchise I felt hadn\u2019t been screwed up, and I just wanted his character to be left alone.",

What I liked about the movie was that Solo goes from an optimist to the scoundrel with a heart of gold we all know based on his experiences during the movie. \n\nIt sucks that this movie gets a lot of flack because I remember when this movie was releasing they were plagued with delays due to changes in creative vision and issues with Ehrenreich's performance.\n\nI really didn't like the whole origin of Solo's surname though. I wished they stuck with Solo's original origin.",

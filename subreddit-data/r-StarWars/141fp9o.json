So I honestly don\u2019t even know if there was anywhere she could get a new crystal from. The films completely skipped out on that detail. Would\u2019ve been cool seeing Rey finding her Kyber crystal, since in the game Cal states that you can\u2019t just use any old crystal and you have to get the one that calls to you. So i don\u2019t think she would be able to just reuse a crystal from someone else\u2019s saber.",

Especially when the series is broken up into different trilogies which are sorta self contained.\n\nUsually a new bad guy shows up or ideally the outcome of defeated the bad guy causes the next crisis. What they did here was just lazy. Then again the two remaining bad guys, Hux and Ren, were just made into complete total jokes so they had to do something. Hux is ragdolled in a way that would fit in a Mel Brooks movie. And Ren is made to look like a petulant teenager, and not the scary kind either.",

Personally I still think the ending to TLJ was severely disappointing, and I honestly don't think a follow-up film would have been great. I did read the script for Duel of the Fates, and it definitely didn't sound great, and it's not surprising that they went through all sorts of reshoots.\n\nRian Johnson said he wanted to kill off Luke in TLJ because he wanted the last film of the trilogy to concentrate more on the new characters, but I think that really wasn't a good idea. The sequel trilogy should have concentrated on giving a satisfying send-off for the original characters while introducing new characters to follow and get invested in, but since the new characters would still be around at the end of the trilogy they should have still been secondary to the primary characters. I mean why spend $4 billion on a franchise where the original characters are the primary draw if you're just going to put the brand new characters the spotlight straight away?\n\nWhile the scene of Luke becoming one with the force in TLJ looked amazing, it definitely should have been at the end of the 3rd film, not in the middle of the trilogy. I just felt so hollow watching that scene in the theatre because it seemed so out of place and just too soon. We only got the smallest whiff of the Luke we knew and loved from the OT at the end or TLJ, and I think he should have been alive through the entirety of the final film and more similar to his original character.\n\nI also think making Rey the titular \"Last Jedi\" was a bad choice, since taking the title of the previous main character is a standard fan-fiction trope. The only person who should be the \"Last Jedi\" in the Skywalker era should be Luke. But that's just my opinion.\n\nPersonally I think the much better way to end the film would have been to make Rey take Kylo's hand after the throne room fight, and have them go from there.",

Could have done like a 3 year timeskip to IX where Finn trains as a Jedi under Leia with the goal of redeeming Rey.

But at the end of the day having a story that didn\u2019t retcon itself would have been an improvement from what we got. There was so many different ways they could have taken the story after TLJ that would have been better than TRoS",

I mean in the movies you see one character with saberstaff, and that's what made it unique and memorable. I wish they would have left it this way. IMO characters like Pong Krell, who seem to double wield saberstaffs, and yet do not accidentally dismember themselves are something a nine year-old high on sugar would come up with.",

It relates to the audience, since many of us have ancestors that have done evil. And from a science fiction perspective, it's great since it's showing someone confronting her evil ancestor which isn't possible in real life, because our ancestors stay dead in real life.  \n\nUltimately it has the same point, who she's related to doesn't define her.

I just dislike this \"special snowflake Jedi\" attitude with unique Force gimmicks and fancy lightsaber design and colors. (looking at you, Samuel!) Rey's \"golden\" lightsaber falls into the same category. Jedi aren't about being \"unique\" or \"special\". There is nothing wrong with the most powerful Jedi wielding a \"boring\", single-bladed blue lightsaber. You can leave the fancy cosmetics to video game customizations and fan-fiction. \n\nI want my Jedi to be reasonable, wise paragons but the more \"unique\" features they get the more it distracts from their character - or the lack of it. That's one of the reasons why I like Qui-Gon Jinn so much. He didn't stand out due to his outward appearance (even though I like the way Neeson looked while portraying him) but due to how and who he was and handled things.",

                    "comment": "Not to 'um actually' you but yellow/gold lightsaber blades already existed in Star Wars before Rey. She's not a 'special snowflake' just for having a gold lightsaber. \n\nAn example would be the Jedi temple guard who used yellow/gold blades, and they first appeared - if Google is correct - in S5 of TCW back in 2013. \n\nKotOR also had different blade colours. I don't know why you want to 'leave fancy cosmetics to video games' when they are perfectly reasonable additions.  \n\nIf anything, I think the initial idea of Jedi being limited to blue and green whilst Sith being limited to just red reflects the simplicity of Lucas' initial morality play idea, and that the expansion into more colours and designs is a good and logical continuation of the universe. \n\nRey in universe also *is* unique and special, much to many people's dismay - she's a Palpatine, and becomes the titular last of the Jedi once Luke becomes one with the force.",

                            "comment": "I definitely agree that I don't think giving Rey a new colour for her lightsaber was that bad an idea and it isn't what made her \"too special\" and unique. If anyone was \"special\" for having a brand new colour lightsaber never seen before, that would be Mace Windu, but that was mainly because Sam Jackson was such a big star he could basically ask for anything from Lucas and Lucas would allow it, but the different colours of lightsaber to signify different types of Jedi when they get their kyber crystal is a really interesting idea and the big screen really needs more colours of lightsaber than just green and blue. I also wouldn't be against them changing some of the colours of lightsabers in the prequel films in a \"special edition\" kind of way since that would actually improve the universe in my opinion.\n\nBut I do think the character of Rey as a whole definitely comes across as \"too special\" and \"too important\" in the Star Wars universe to her detriment. She really reminds me of the fan-fiction character I made for the Harry Potter universe when I was much younger that survived the killing curse from Voldemort, then became good friends with the main trio and then went on to kill Voldemort and became the new chosen one, before becoming the youngest headmaster Hogwarts ever saw. Having her become  \"the Last Jedi\" and kill Palpatine and become the new leader of a new Jedi order is what really made her character a true fan-fiction tier character in my opinion.",

Out of universe, sure, but in-universe, it would have been a reasonable decision for her to both honor her roots and to suit her technical background and skills. Perhaps she loses to Kylo or someone using a standard lightsaber and realizes she has to lean into what she knows to defeat that foe, and makes a lightsaber staff/pike.",

    "postText": "I mean probably pretty obvious, but non force users should immediately be killed by sith. \n\nThey don't have the force to protect them. \n\nForce choke is the least of their worries, force burst an artery in the brain would instantly kill any normal dude. \n\nI can understand bounty hunters being able to kill Jedi since they don't do that. (except mace when he crushed Grevious' Lungs) (I know it's not cannon anymore but idc, it's cannon to me) \n\nBut sith? Never in any situation that doesn't involve a sniper. (even then, there's a good chance the sith would see it coming) \n\nUnless of course force choke is a really hard skill (which I don't think it should be. I mean if a standard Jedi can do a force push, I think a standard sith should be able to squeeze hard enough to pop a vein) \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Admittedly, Jedi will not be as likely to be brutal as Sith, but the fact remains: Anyone who stands up in a flurry of blaster fire is going to die.\n\nOne on one, I concede your point though.",

                    "comment": "Good answer, though I slightly disagree. Order 66 worked because the clones were trusted allies which meant they had the element of surprise, along with overwhelming numbers. Even then it didn\u2019t get all the Jedi. A powerful force user against a large group of non force users should still be fine in most circumstances. Yoda and Obi Wan dealt with a lot of clones at the Jedi temple. Pong Krell was having an easy time with the clones on Umbara and only got beaten by his own complacency. Maul wrecked the clones on the Venator. Vader and Sidious on Ryloth in Lords of the Sith, as another example.",

But if you want a precision strike to the kneecap to break it? Well, that's going to be a lot harder than a crude shove. \n\nPlus, with all the dust-ups the saber swingers get into dragging everyone else into the crossfire, the muggles would be amazingly stupid NOT to develop technology and techniques to no sell or resist. Otherwise, they're just picking which group of saber swingers get to crush their necks.",

Line up your shot with a projectile rifle and take it.",

It\u2019s why the concept of mandalorians being good at fighting Jedi is dubious. At least with Jedi the reasoning of them holding back can potentially be used, so a non force user may be able to use trickery to evade them; not outright beat them though. A Sith would have no reason to hold back, so they should obliterate pretty much any non force user. I think people sometimes forget how OP the top tier force users can be.",

I think the balance is that very powerful force users only make up a very small percentage of the force users there are in the galaxy at any time. So the majority of force users would be vulnerable to bounty hunters/droids etc.",

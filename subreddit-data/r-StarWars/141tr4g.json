    "postText": "Bit of a spoiler concerning Mandalorian s2 / s3 and book of Boba Fett\n\nMy girlfriend and I finished The Mandalorian season 2 last year, so we decided to wait for the season 3 to be fully aired before watching it. So, forward to April, we start episode 1 of season 3 and... We don't understand a think. Why is Grogu with Din ? Why is he banned from the Mandalorian order ? \n\nA quick research and I see that The Mandalorian returns in The Book of Boba Fett, thus his storyline progresses in another show. Well... Here we are, watching The Boof of Boba Fett. \n\nIt's actually a nice show, we're enjoying ourselves, so no biggie. And then, episode 5 of The Book of **Boba Fett**, why is Din Djarin here and, why don't we see Boba Fett for the entire episode ? &gt;:(",

He's questioning why does he have to watch a Mando episode in a different show. He could've worded it better than \"why is Din there\" but I think that's the point, he knows Din was going to be there but he's asking WHY he's there.\n\nIf you're a new Star Wars fan and you pick up Mando and watch the 3 seasons, you will get confused going from S2 to S3.\n\nThis is not the first time I hear people getting confused going into S3",

That\u2019s why all these newer shows interact the way they do.\n\nMy personal theory is that its all building up to the rise of the first order, given that so much of it takes place in between ep 6 and ep 7, and that there was some hinting at something like this in the new season of mandalorian. Possibly the goal behind this will be to make the rise of the first order more \u201cpalatable\u201d to the average star wars fan.",

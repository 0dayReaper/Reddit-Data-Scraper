    "postText": "A lot of people seem to think it was unrealistic that the Ewoks were able to wipe out an entire Imperial legion, but I think it makes perfect sense.\n\nThink about it. The Empire parked their shield generator in a densely wooded forest, completely surrounded by hostile natives that both outnumbered them and were intimately familiar with the territory.\n\nWhile the Ewoks obviously spent months observing their enemies, setting up traps and preparing a massive assault, the Imperials were completely ignoring them. Probably thought of them as little more than vermin. They were laser focused on the rebels. No preparation for a large scale attack on their base. \n\nA legion of over 10k must\u2019ve seemed like overkill, turns out it wasn\u2019t nearly enough. The Ewoks achieved complete, overwhelming surprise.",

The music shifted for a bit and we saw their plans fail against the Empires larger war machines. I do think that the Stormtroopers getting wied out by rocks and arrows that bounce off their armor is stupid but without the Rebels assisting them their chances of winning were little to none.\n\nI could only imagine them facing the First Order... Flame Troopers would probably be the end of the Ewoks.",

And for their strength, they tied up the rebels, including Chewbacca, and had no problem carrying them with only 2 Ewoks to a prisoner, through dense forest. \n\nSo while some people think they were a stupid addition, I see a physically powerful, stealthy, intelligent species THAT WANTS TO F*CKING EAT YOU.",

With how powerful they were, the Empire could have easily won the war if they just made better decisions. But no one except Dedra believed that an organized rebellion could be a significant threat until it was too late. No one believed that said Rebellion could sneak into one of their most heavily guarded bases and steal the plans to their ultimate superweapon until it was too late. No one believed that the Rebellion could successfully destroy said superweapon until it was too late. It's just one way in which the Empire parallels Nazi Germany, who also could have won their war if they didn't make terrible decisions. Stories like Empire Strikes Back and Bad Batch Season 2 show how easily the Empire wins when they simply make good decisions. Ultimately, the Empire's continued overconfidence that led to their downfall.",

This is basically the worst place to put an armoured division besides directly in the ocean or inside a city. The main strength of armoured units is long range fire superiority and it\u2019s main weakness is maneuvering in tight spaces. A dense forest basically negates all advantages of heavy armour while amplifying all disadvantages. \n\nI know AT-ATs and AT-STs are supposed to handle terrain better than tanks but their line of sight is still limited to a few meters in dense forests. Likewise, turning around to face the enemy has to be a pain in the ass when you run the risk of nocking over trees and tripping on logs.",

In the ROTJ film sequences showing the Ewoks attacking stormtroopers , none of the troopers were killed by penetrating weapons. They were killed by concussive weapons. Rocks do not penetrate armour but they can break bones, leave bruises, and knock people unconscious.\n\nThe Ewoks brought down ATSTs by tripping them, much like the Rebels did on Hoth. ATSTs were also destroyed by logs caving in the sides, sides that were impenetrable for pointy Ewok weapons but to logs weighing several tons. ATATs would have been harder to deal with, but they were shown operating only in areas largely clear of trees and undergrowth. So I am not sure how much of a threat/advantage they presented.\n\nBlasters probably killed many Ewoks. Stormtroopers can only seen in a 180 degree field to their front. They could not simultaneously engage Ewoks forward and watch for Ewoks from above or behind. ROTJ has scene were stormtroopers kill a number of Ewoks and pursue the rest only to be jumped from above and killed by another group of Ewoks.",

Also, their short stubby bodies means that they could not handle the majority of captured Imperail weapons, if they were to do so. The Ewoks have to get close to cause any damage. And at close range, they be at a dramatic disadvantage due to stormtroopers' blasters and their physically larger size.

I would have loved to see what the Ewoks would have been able to do against KX security droids and DT sentry droids, which would obviously be present at such a crucial facility. (I know, I know, they weren't a thing in 1983).\n\nThe only reason the Empire lost and was unbelievably incompetent was because the script demanded it. End of story. It's not even an issue that the Empire underestimated their opponents, they simply weren't meant to work or act like anything even remotely more organized than a bunch of headless chickens running around. The Ewoks set the stage for the ludicrous stuff we'd get in TPM and the prequels in general. And they're not even the bit that annoys me the most about the Battle of Endor.",

When you're fighting an enemy that defends its territory, knows the terrain, has support from the local population and can blend in with it, you can't really win. The only way to win in this scenario is literally to exterminate the enemy, something that in reality is almost never politically achievable and something I imagine the empire would have considered if they weren't defeated at the same time. The empire also seems terrible at COIN as viewed in Andor, a show that extremely realistically portrays an insurgency in its early phase.",

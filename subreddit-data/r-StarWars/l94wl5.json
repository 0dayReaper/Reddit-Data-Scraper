If the AT-AT is the same one brand I think it is, there\u2019s a few other Star Wars ornaments they do. The company that manufactures them essentially sells them off to different brands to be branded differently (For example the \u201cbrand name\u201d we get them under is Underwater Treasures but they also exist under other brand names). They also do a Millennium Falcon, a Death Star, and wrecked Vader helmet from TFA. All are quite nice. They\u2019re also not officially licensed so they may be a little hard to track down without know the exact wording of the product name (i.e. Underwater Treasures calls the Death Star the \u201cSpace Ball\u201d).",

Yet this show has won acclaim and Emmy nominations and is one of the only things the public collectively watches together anymore. Why do people treat giving the fans what they want as such a bad thing? Disney's just built an entire financial strategy based around that with a Boba Fett show, Obi-Wan show, Rogue Squadron, Ahsoka show, Clone Wars spinoff, more Rogue One (the only new movie we can generally agree on liking). Sure, I've seen plenty of bad fan ideas - but with the success of The Mandalorian by all measures, I really don't think giving fans what they want should be viewed as a dirty concept anymore.",

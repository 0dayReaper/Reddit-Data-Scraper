It's basically the same thing, one just more tangible, I guess. I don't mind the concept, at all, I just think it may be redundant. I wonder if the reasoning is to leave the option open for clones to remove the chip itself. But to be honest, I think 'overpowering' their programming might be more powerful than removing the chip.",

Back in legends you had several groups of clones that refused order 66. The rates were considered marginal at best amongst normal clones but rather high with arc and specialist teams like commandos. The republic commandos books follows a squad that effectively sees both sides of this.",

He had been attacked by the Jedi and the Senate/people were pretty easy to convince the Jedi were being shits. The clones in legends are very clearly and explicitly stated to be utterly loyal to the republic itself, and I believe it's said on kamino as well. \n\nThe rank and file clones are heavily pressed and bred to not be super independent thinkers in terms of anything other than \"how is it best for me to kill this thing.\" While commandos and arcs are much more flexible in their thinking and emotions. Up until things like clone wars and some legends/canon content the clones had 0 emotional and personal thinking. They were breathing robots vs metal ones. That's part of the fun moral question imo. Personally I prefer the no chip because it actually allows the clones to functionally choose or manage to grow. The chips say \"some of you are special and have special brains or stronger wills and get to not be robotic killing machines\" while the rest of the clones just...... Still function the same anyway. But either way it doesn't change too much in the overall story. Imo. \n\nTL;DR - it doesn't actually matter brain chip vs indoctrination sideous won once Mace failed to kill him no matter what happened. And the clones are tragic either way.",

BUT if Rex can resist the chip than it means that any clone is technically capable of it, which takes away from the definiteness of the chip, bringing it back down to the level of, \"they're passive and programmed to obey with no questions\". Which is why I feel its somewhat redundant. Sure, you can say Rex is extremely strong-willed for a clone or has a particularly strong connection with Ahsoka, but you could apply the same logic to the result of the cloning techniques, and honestly it probably makes more sense that way.\n\nIf there's a chip, and we're blaming the clones actions for it, I'd prefer it's either all or nothing. If it's in your brain then you can't fight it. Otherwise, all the clones with chips really don't have an excuse for genocide because they always had the ability to fight it, they just weren't strong enough.\n\nOverall, I think like above users suggested it does sort of achieve the objective or making the clones more empathetic or at least forgivable. The chip is more a scapegoat than a logical explanation.  And as u/Fokker_Snek mentions in another comment chain; rebellions are an issue amongst soldiers when ordered to do acts they believe are morally wrong. Except in Bad Batch we see clones going against their commanders even with the chip. I think this arc makes more sense if it's against their genetic programming than a chip.\n\nOverall, if given the choice I'd certainly keep the chips as part of canon because the Fives arc in the Clone Wars is absolutely too good to lose.",

It's a good thing we were wearing helmets, because none of us could bear to look her in the eye.\"\n\n-501st Journal\n\nAnd also:\n\nThe Exile: \"You seem to have thought this through.\"\n\nHK-47: \"Cautionary: Oh no, master. In fact that is the worst thing you can do.\n\nExplanation: Statistically, overplanning the assassination of a Jedi seems to backfire.\n\nExtrapolation: There are many theorists who claim Jedi can see the future, and I do not know if that is true, but it seems impulsive acts are more common to succeed than planned incidents.\"\n\n\n\nWith these scraps of data we can see a few contradictions, how could the clones prepare for a contingency, have it ready to go at a moment's notice for 3+ years, and 10,000 Jedi never detect it? I'd argue not only does the inhibitor chip fix this continuity error but also opens the door to a whole lot more interesting storylines.",

Jedi Padawan #3 is not involved whatsoever. \n\nAnd even if we gave that to the clones, why would they not stun the Jedi and take them into custody? Most of the Jedi were shot from behind, they could've easily been stunned and brought in for questioning. You'd think that if the clones really valued their friendships with the Jedi, they would have brought them in alive if the option was available, instead of mercilessly executing them.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, clones executing order 66 without question in a no chip world makes clones way too heartless and undeserving of sympathy.

They have been force-fed indoctrination since they were born, they were genetically modified to not question orders. There is a reason almost any court in the world doesn't hold children to the same standards as adults. \n\nNone of what you're saying here is wrong, I can believe all of this, but what I'm arguing is moreso which is more compelling. A lot of it has to do with personal opinion too.\n\nFor example, the idea of clones being utterly indoctrinated and brainwashed, genetically roboticized to the point that they're more droidlike than even droids, that *sounds* very tragic. But if I *watch* the clones mercilessly execute the Jedi with no questions, with nothing but cold, blank looks on their faces, I feel nothing. I see no tragedy there because from my standpoint, the clones are not even human, they are genetically modified monsters. They are not deserving of sympathy.\n\nWhereas if I watch TCW, where clones are portrayed as naive, certainly brainwashed, but still *human* and capable of critical thinking to a degree, I feel for them. And then when Rex flinches as he resists Order 66, I feel the tragedy. Because the clones were made to follow orders, but just when they were given one they might have refused, whatever semblance of free will they have cultivated over 3 years is stripped from them.\n\n\n&gt;You also ignore the fact that they were dealing with force users. And they were soldiers. Soldiers aren't trained in police actions, they are trained to kill. Which is why many nations separate the military from the police.\n\nAgain, none of this is really wrong. But if I'm to believe the clones fostered close relationships with their Jedi Generals, I would expect to see more hesitation or questioning. They have been brainwashed, but to what extent? After 3 years of war where they've been close by the Jedi throughout, you'd expect any scrap of humanity they have to shine through. \n\nA lot of this comes down to Order 66 needing to be close to 100% effective. Either the chips must come into play to force it, or the clones must be that much of a hive mind. And if the clones are really that much of a hive mind, then I don't have as much sympathy for them.",

I think the concept really dilutes the entire point that they were clones created for a specific purpose. Maybe it's easier to explain how they would have been outwardly friendly to the jedi before the order but I kind of disagree. To me, and this is maybe my headcanon, prior to order 66 happening, it would have been just like any other military policy or process understood by the clones as a plan for the worst case scenario. I think this is implied, as well, by the fact that it's called Order 66... If all it involved was activating the chips, wouldn't it have been better to have Palpatine tell some mystery entity \"activate the chips\" and then show the troopers suddenly change? \n\nI just hate any time we put on the kid gloves when they aren't needed. Mystery chips are very much \"oh no, the clones are actually nice guys, they've just been mind controlled to commit atrocities\" and is much worse than \"yeah sorry, the clones were never on the side of the jedi and are simply operating the way they were designed/trained\".",

And when they got an order from the chancellor, who leads the republic they've been bred and trained to serve, they followed it.\n\nAnd I liked that some of the clones may have been disillusioned with the republic to the point that they didn't follow the order. They deserted. They cared about their Jedi generals too much to turn on them. Etc. \n\nI understand why the chips were put in to make the clones victims without making things too dark. But shit. They already were victims. A glorified slave army. Bred to fight and die for a war they had no stake in because they had no rights as citizens of the republic because they weren't citizens.

The clones being hardwired to carry out some special directives without question makes more sense I think the clone wars show how a lot of clone units worked very closely with the Jedi for years and in a lot of cases they formed strong bonds. I think it makes it all the more tragic that the overwhelming majority of clones then proceed to betray the Jedi due to some hardwired chip in their brain chemistry and they do it without even being fully aware of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s also fits Darth Sidious because he\u2019s all about manipulation and scheming plus using the Jedi\u2019s own clone army to betray them makes sense Sidious loves humiliating the Jedi it\u2019s why he wakes up in the morning.",

Without the chips the clones are straight up just evil, they turn on the Jedi(their FRIENDS) in seconds with almost no deliberation, not only is it unrealistic it just makes the clones boring,unthinking and evil, whereas the current clones are one of the most tragic parts of Disney canon",

Thanks to their age being accelerated they were all much younger than they appeared and the only life they knew up to that was entirely focused on training and obedience.  Everyone of them would've been utterly desensitized to violence and aggression.  \n\nMorality is something that is actually learned and taught and is why it almost always aligns with the current society and can differ so much from one place in the world to another.  If the clones weren't taught any then they would literally have none.  They could be just brutal killing machines.\n\nThere's no possible way for a person to live a life of a clone solider and be anything resembling normal.  The chips were whatever, I don't actually care about them, but there's no way any of the clones would care about who they're pointing their guns at with or without chips except those specific few that worked close enough with the jedi to actually form bonds.  It just felt like cheap way to make their story more tragic when it already felt pretty terrible from the get go but it also didn't really change anything.",

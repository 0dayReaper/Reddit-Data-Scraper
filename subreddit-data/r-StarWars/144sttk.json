    "postText": "This has probably been asked before, but as a longtime Star Wars fan, I am interested.\n\nI grew up with the prequels and always thought they were great. As a more mature individual now I can see they definitely have their limitations, and aren\u2019t as good as the originals. Still, I think their good points outweigh their bad. \n\nThe good: \n\n1. I liked the world building. Just how vast and civilized the Future galactic empire was. In the OG Star Wars we were limited by 1977-83 technology. No green screens so we just had \u201c the desert planet\u201d \u201c the ice planet etc.\u201d\n\nIt was truly impressive seeing Coruscant, Naboo, and geobosis.\n\n\n2. The Rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker. \n\nPeople mock and deride Hayden Christiansen to this day, him and his *NSYNC hairstyle. They say he was a bad actor and a terrible choice for Vader. I disagree. He wasn\u2019t a method actor, but he was a good choice. His \u201c wooden\u201d way just represented a very emotionally repressed and stunted young man finally coming to terms with his feelings. And yes, he was possessive and creepy, as Lucas said he was. It\u2019s easy to see how he was ( easily ) seduced to the dark side.\n\n3. The characters. Sure there were losers like Jar Jar Binks and General Grievous. But what of Count Dooku, Mace Windu, Qui Gonn Jinn and Dex dressier? What of Ewan McGregor\u2019s Obi Wan? Even at 40 Obi Wan was a dignified English gentleman lol.\n\n4. The battles. The battles of Hoth and Endor were great but they didn\u2019t have the tech to do Naboo, Mustafar, Coruscant etc.\n\nThe bad;\n\n1. Lightsabers. I enjoyed the lightsaber fighting but sometimes they went on too long. The fights between Greivous and Kenobi and Anakin and Kenobi almost resembled dragon ball Z fights.\n\n2. Politics. I know Lucas is a political junkie, and that Revenge of the Sith was sort of a parable about the rise of Hitler as well as an indictment of the then Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq. \n\nBut Lucas goes in too deep with it \u201c special session this\u201d and \u201c emergency vote that\u201d. It was especially awful in Phantom menace.  Speaking of which\u2026\n\n\n3 the Phantom menace. Really my least favorite Star Wars movie. I don\u2019t think it Could have made any money without \u201c Star Wars\u201d slapped to it. Sort of like \u201c Disney channel Star Wars family special\u201d\n\nThoughts?",

It's just my least favorite trilogy of the Skywalker saga, and TPM is my least favorite film of the Skywalker saga.\n\nAotC is okay, and RotS is pretty good.\n\nBest part is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan. He made the character his own and fleshed him out. Dude carried those films, IMO. He *is* Obi-Wan. There's also several iconic scenes that came out of it all: Duel of the fates. Obi-Wan versus Jango in the asteroid field above Geonosis.\n\nMy mind hasn't changed in the past 23 years, either. It hasn't \"grown\" on me. I despise Jar Jar just as much now as then. Unlike the kids over at prequel memes, I definitely do *not* think they are masterpieces.\n\nIt's weird how some people I interact with in this sub think I must hate the prequels if I like and prefer the sequels, but least favorite =/= hate.\n\nOh, and although I never liked Jar Jar, I was not one of the people who verbally attacked GL and Ahmed Best. I think those kind of people are gross and I still do. If you sent hate mail to Ahmed, bullied Kelly Marie Tran on social media, or sent racist tweets to Moses Ingram, let me be very clear: *you're gross and you don't belong in this fandom.*",

As in the actors actually fought as we see on screen. [They trained for weeks for the duel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WocOljDAxlA&amp;t=18s) before they filmed it. Only a few of the force jumps were CGI. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Politics. I know Lucas is a political junkie, and that Revenge of the Sith was sort of a parable about the rise of Hitler as well as an indictment of the then Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq.\n\nROTS was written in 2001/2002 and shot in 2003/2004. The Iraq war started in 2003 and things didn't really go to hell until 2005, well after the film was mostly ready. Iraq war had little to do with it. TCW on the other hand were influence by the WoT.\n\nThat said, the politics in the prequels is one of things which has aged the best. There is a reason why the \"so this is how liberty die...\" quote has entered the political lexicon, since the rise of right wing populism is something which happened mostly after 2005.",

They didn't say that anything was unrealistic or CGI, they just said they went on far too long, a complaint I fully agree with. I also think they look far too choreographed, too many hits obviously aiming for the sabers and too many goofy spins and things like that.\n\nNone of that has to do with CGI or anything technical, but the artistic decisions made with the fights.",

As deeply flawed and screwed up as Hayden christenstns Anakin was, I saw the good in him and wanted him to succeed.\n\nWholly different with the sequels.

However it just seemed like massive cash grab/ fan service with so much stuff that didn\u2019t make sense ( Somehow Palpatine came back!)\n\nLike I didn\u2019t even watch rise of skywalker because it felt too much like fan service  and not a story that featured \u201c real\u201d people I actually liked and cared about",

Not everything worked and there was a lot of filler in a move that everyone knew could only end one way.  The Anakin's relationships with Palpatine, Obi-Wan, and Padme were good even if they were rushed in a few places, and I'm always excited to watch heroes fall.

The music is great of course.  Duel of the Fates is probably my favorite score from any Star Wars movie.  It also bugs me that they completely abandoned the plot line of who ordered the clone army, and you have to get supplemental materials to find that out.  The overall story is pretty good, and is GREATLY enhanced by The Clone Wars (this one I don\u2019t mind because you don\u2019t need to watch The Clone Wars for the story to make sense, it just enhances the story that is already there).",

Each original movie felt very long and like too much talking. Weird low key sexist or creepy guy moments throughout the movie. Luke being a lame little loser. I find him unbelievably annoying. \n\nAs far as prequels, namely episode 3 I found anakin very relatable as I was myself just getting over a dark path. The dark stuff he was feeling felt relatable. His raw pain in episode 3 was palpable. I felt like I understood his fear and how he had made such a huge mistake. And I knew eventually he would redeem himself so that was nice.\n\nI feel like the music was better. The fighting scenes were better and longer, more special force abilities. Padmes labor funeral and anakin being made into dark Vader at the same time.. those parallels were amazing. I think episode 2 was good just for all the special effects, obi wan time, clone wars, and the monsters trial scene.  Obviously anakin was cringe.",

Two or three lines are always criticized that half of the time people don't even understand, but it's curious that they forget all the legendary phrases that the entire saga has given.

The OG trilogy is deeply steeped in allusions to both WWII and the Vietnam War. Some contemporary reviews decried it for promoting a minority group overthrowing government. Additionally as clumsy at times though it many I think people forget the real stand George Lucas took putting an strong anti-war message in RoS. He has always maintained the source for this was Vietnam but he has publicly acknowledged the strong parallels between the two conflicts so make that what you will to me it says he knew what he was doing. Principle shooting for RoS finished in 2003 only about 6 months the invasion started though there were pickups in 2004. Now most people like to pretend that we knew the invasion was a bad idea and were against from the start but in 03/04 little media was openly against or even critical of it including news coverage. There were reviews called for a boycott of RoS for these reasons. Today politics continues in Star Wars and shows like Andor prove it can be done in a balanced manner in the franchise.",

            "comment": "I loved them because of the overarching plot woven through all 3 movies of the Sith taking control and destroying the Jedi, culminating in Anikan\u2019s turn to the dark side and the Sith controlling the galaxy.  So many movies are too positive where ,after a struggle, the good guys always win.  Was nice to see the opposite for a change.  \n\nI loved how the Sith were playing both sides (the Separatists and the Republic) in secrecy, and how they created a clone army in secrecy unbeknownst to the Jedi.  When Order 66 played out on the screen, it was a stroke of genius by Sidious, and completely shocking and heartbreaking for me to watch.  The 3 movies made me feel strong emotions.  Did it have some sucky dialogue?  Yep.  Did they overuse special effects instead of taking a more realistic approach?  Yes again.  Was Jar Jar corny?  Yep.  Despite those minor gripes, taken together all 3 prequels were a masterpiece of storytelling.  And something Disney has yet to figure out how to do in SW.  They\u2019re really a testament to the genius of George Lucas.",

It\u2019s more a movement of sound and vision than a typical movie. Check out \u201cthe prequels are too good for youl on YouTube. A brilliant essay on the brilliance of these films.",

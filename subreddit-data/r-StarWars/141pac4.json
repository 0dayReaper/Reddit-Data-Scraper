That isn\u2019t to say it nullified the space with fantasy, but it took the themes of fantasy, the past, and set them in space, the future. \n\nStar Wars wasn\u2019t the first to do it (like, Dune, so), but it was what broke through. In terms of pop culture, Star Wars is what married the entrenched story themes of western culture to the emerging, forward-looking themes of what western culture now is.",

I mean I'm sure there's an essay or documentary which has already, but the way Star Wars took themes and plot structures which were already universally understood, and applied them to a genre which is, almost by definition, difficult to understand...well it changed pop culture. I know there's a documentary about that.\n\n There's an idea floating around that Star Wars is plagiaristic. Say it took this theme from Dune, or this visual from a Sergio Leone, or this character from Kurosawa. And it did, of course, because all art iterates on previous art. But Star Wars gets nabbed with the label of plagiarism because how it iterated is less visible to a critic. Star Wars' most important iteration is in how it interacted with audiences (western ones, anyway). It's going to be very rare now that someone watches The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Yojimbo, or even Buck Rogers, without being exposed first to Star Wars. And that's why Star Wars is what it is: it took the eminently relatable themes of several different styles, and made them eminently consumable. In a suitably space-based turn of phrase, it eclipses them.\n\nThe light of the sun is flowing around the edges and, but, why is anyone looking? It's no moon",

It's stuff like this - more than the white of my beard - that reminds me how old I am.\n\nI was born in the 70s and as awful as people think this quality is, the quality from the previous decade was so much worse. [This is just a little over a decade before this clip](https://youtu.be/rIGcRuNotUs). On top of this, you have to remember that many (maybe most) of these broadcasts were over the airwaves and picked up on the crappy television antennas that came with your TV \n\nDepending on the channel and the strength of the signal, there could be a type of [pixilation or \"snow\" on the screen during a broadcast](https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/217363710-static-snow-no-signal-old-vintage-80s-tv-static-black-and-wh). It generally wasn't this bad, but it could be.\n\nOh, and television screen size was **much** smaller. The affordable televisions were 13 to 19 inches. The \"big screen\" was about 25 inches. Not too many people shelled out that kind of cash for a TV\n\nSo, you've got pretty bad video quality, spotty reception, snow, and I haven't even mentioned [vertical and horizontal hold](https://www.britannica.com/technology/horizontal-hold-control), on a really small screen. \n\nIt's funny to me because perspective is everything. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to fire up my Atari 2800 on my old black and white TV",

Conan joked to Letterman he got the gig by winning an essay writing contest.  \n\nWe know that\u2019s not true but it\u2019s the sort of energy the early show had and the persona Conan used as the host.  It\u2019s a vibe like some kids very good at doing the morning announcements for their school were given a tv talk show with an hour to fill every night.  And the feeling was it could fall apart at any time. Fall apart in a funny nerdy way where you\u2019d feel for sorry for them and hope the teacher still gave them a C.\n\nLetterman\u2019s Late Night had a danger to it that if it went off the rails the audience might be eaten.  \n\nBack for Conan.  Interviews like this in the 1990s are super cool and unique.  Part of that is Conan is from Gen X when Jay and Dave are baby boomers.   So Conan is an actual Star Wars fan interviewing Mark Hamill.  This interview is a big deal for Conan and the audience.  And Hamil is still young here.  He could play young hero Luke.  \n\nBest of all Hamill can tell the audience are actual fans and love his portrayal of Luke.  He doesn\u2019t need to down play that or talk about other more serious aspirations.  \n\nThe entire interview has great energetic and chemistry.",

Seasons 1 and 2 were more obviously written for Cartoon Network back in like 2008-2009. But even here there are some good episodes. The ones to note from here that I can think of off the top of my head are Rookies in Season 1 and The Deserter in Season 2. These seasons do like to emphasize the individuality and personality of the clones too, but you can get that from most episodes",

The word \u201cWars\u201d may be in the title, but it still felt like too much shooting things and not enough character development as I would have liked. Then I skipped to the Season 2 episodes in this plan, and I started understanding the hype. Now I\u2019m on Season 7, and\u2026 Wow!",

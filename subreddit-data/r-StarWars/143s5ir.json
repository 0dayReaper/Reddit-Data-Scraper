Not like you. Not like her. I can\u2019t summon a lightsaber to my hand without trickery. I can\u2019t read peoples minds. I can\u2019t feel it \u2026 the force \u2026 at all.

It could only be . . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He ran to catch up with the Jedi Master. \u201cWait . . . you mean I *can* be a Jedi?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yoda stopped and scowled. \u201dStudy you should, the Farseeker Lyr. No great power had he, yet from his ink sprang some of the Jedi\u2019s greatest texts. For though the Jedi and the force are one , the Force is not what a jedi makes.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The boy frowned. \u201cThen what makes a Jedi?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yoda jabbed him in the chest with his cane. \u201cThat is something only you can answer\u201d\n\n(What a Jedi Makes \u2013 Star Wars: Stories of the Jedi and Sith)",

If what you ask is how far you can go on that road before you can't push any further, that would depend on your Force Sensitivity, which depends on midichlorians. But you can learn some no matter what.",

Sure some people would have more gift than others, but if everyone is connected to this life energy...\n\nI also think Jedi and Sith both would want this information buried in order to maintain their monopolies on Force power. Sith wouldn't want a bunch of people they bullied able to team up and fight back and Jedi would fear people making petty mischief with it.",

The final 2 episodes of Mando definitely had a bit more of an edge: im thinking about the scene with the imperial officer and Bill Burr\u2019s character, actively discussing mass casualties and not glossing over the fact a shit load of people died. Obviously the Death Stars destruction is always a big plot point but really digging in to death and the ramifications of it on such a massive scale can get heavy, and the show handled it well. \n\nAlso, Cara Dune did just shoot a dude point blank in the face- which felt fairly \u2018un-disney\u2019 to me but I\u2019m all for it, especially if it\u2019s in a boba-led series. So here\u2019s hoping there are a few more...mature Star Wars series. S2 of mando has reignited my excitement for the franchise and I\u2019m curious about the slate of new shows and what this team will deliver.\n\nEdit: surprised to see gold, thanks stranger!

Instead the viewer would have context.\n\nThere could have been so much cool shit to see with the New Republic, how the First Order formed and came to power, and could have had some of these badass side characters show up in the main movies.",

It's not like they can retcon those movies, that'd be embarrassing, so now they're kind of stuck working around them. Which is why I think it's been a good idea to stick to pre and post OT but before the sequels.",

If I remember correctly all the non-cannon math that fans did said a single Imperial Star Destroyer could accomplish this task within about 3 days of continuous bombardment.\n\nThe Death Star was revolutionary because it could accomplish the something in seconds, but the Empire always had (and used) this level of destructive capability.\n\nI have no idea what the current cannon number would be for how long this would take but I can't imagine it's too different.",

So she's doubling down that there are still problems that's why Boba Fett will for now take over Mandalorian for Season 3 \ud83d\ude44",

At that point, season 2 had been hinting that Din would get more comfortable with the fact that mandalorian's really can remove their helmets, and that he'd do it more often.  After the finale, there's no doubt we'll be seeing more of his face in season 3.\n\nPlus, worst case scenario, Disney could just make Pedro only do the voicework, and allow Brenden Wayne to continue being the physical character under the helmet.  That's essentially what they did with all of season 1, and is what they did with Vader...\n\nBut, Pedro loves the role, is getting high praise for it, and should be showing his face some more moving forward.  Why would he leave?",

I really would love to see this series explore his relationship with his father, the cloning facility on Kamino (the design of Kamino is impeccable), and the other clones. It\u2019s such a fascinating concept.\n\nAlso, give us some Fennec backstory because she\u2019s pretty generic right now.",

Their relationship is deeper, she holds him to a higher standard, she\u2019s upset with how their relationship unfolded.

Regardless of the status/details of a relationship, I consider a relationship where one *doesn't* insult and belittle the other for a different POV, as better quality than one that does.\n\nAnd... No, you actually don't *have* to assume anything about me :) My interactions with other human beings have taught me time and again that belittling and arguing with them about something we disagree on - especially in the middle of an emergency - doesn't improve the quality of the relationship nor does it change their opinion of the subject we disagree on, and is usually counterproductive.",

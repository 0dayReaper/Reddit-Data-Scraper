It's also short enough to be covered in one [Omnibus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Darth_Vader_by_Charles_Soule_Omnibus) (25 issues + 1 annual).\n\neg. To get full story of Vader Down event that happened with 2015 run you would need Vader Down #1, Darth Vader #13-15 and Star Wars #13-14. Thankfully that has been compiled to one trade paperback called Star Wars: Vader Down. 2020 cross-over event is even worse as it covers 32 issues from 5 different comic book runs.",

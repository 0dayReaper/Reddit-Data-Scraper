It's still a bit of a stretch for the second one but better than \"reign of the empire\" and the franchise often tends to make a distinction between stuff set during the empires mostly unchallenged reign and stuff set after the united rebellion is formed.",

My biggest gripes regarding Rey being the one to rebuild the New Jedi Order all on her own is that she\u2019s had virtually no training yet will succeed where Luke failed in Disney canon (after all they surely can\u2019t the New New Jedi Order fail as well 20 years down the line).\n\n**However** Ahsoka being an actual trained Jedi, a Jedi during the Clone Wars, Empire, and intervening eras, Anakin\u2019s flipping apprentice and the one who I can actually class as part of the Skywalker family out of the two of them, sets her up brilliantly to be the GrandMaster role, completing Rey\u2019s training in turn while Rey as a Knight and likely future leader of the Order is allowed to learn and fail and develop as time goes on.",

Seeing her actually tackle those issues and ideally come out the other side as a more humble and wiser individual would be great to see.\n\n- Ahsoka is the Padawan of Anakin, and so close to be considered a member of the family over the years spent side by side. Similarly she clearly reconnects with Luke and will likely play a big part of his life even intermittently over the period between the OT &amp; the ST. Disney wants us to consider Rey \u201cSkywalker\u201d seriously, despite her having a tenuous connection to the family and barely any interaction lasting longer than a few days to weeks with any of them. Having her bond and learn from Ahsoka and get Ahsoka\u2019s blessing of carrying that name carries a ton more weight.",

She didn't want to train Grogu and she doesn't consider herself a Jedi. She has connections with Luke so it could still happen, although it begs the question of what she did during the Rise of the First Order Era. It seems far fetched that she didn't help Luke, especially after what happened with Ben/Kylo",

In regard to where Ahsoka is during the ST as soon as we knew she was turning up in Rebels everyone wondered the same thing. Where was she during the OT. She was off doing her own thing with her own group of rebels.\n\nThe Galaxy is a big place and the FO/Resistance battles in the ST all take place in the Outer Regions/Unknown Regions on the edge of civilised space. Plus the entire trilogy is over the course of 1 year.\n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable an explanation for someone to reference Ahsoka fighting her own battles during that time elsewhere from where Rey was.\n\nAs for Ben/Kylo. I can see Ahsoka being a guest speaker at the academy rather than a full teacher and after Ben\u2019s turn she likely talked with Luke ever briefly before he couldn\u2019t be dissuaded from his self imposed exile.\n\nAt that time she likely went off on her own.\n\nI can definitely see Luke\u2019s offer of \u201cHelp me rebuild the Order. Build it right\u201d being a decision she regrets turning down by the time of the ST.\n\nI can definitely see her thinking \u201cNo Luke can rebuild it properly as it was, I would only taint it with my non-Jedi Order sensibilities and attitudes\u201d. It\u2019s only AFTER Ben turns and Ahsoka realises that her influence and warnings about the rigidity of the Old Order could\u2019ve been the leading example to stop such a situation from happening.\n\nRey turning up barely trained but apparently with Luke\u2019s blessing to become a Jedi would likely feel like a second chance to Ahsoka, pass on all of her teachings and knowledge **combined** with what Luke reconstructed/changed/self taught in order to build an Order that won\u2019t fall this time.",

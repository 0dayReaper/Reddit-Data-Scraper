Plus they still update the gate (rarely) to fix major issues 15 years later.\n\nEither way, a new game with better ground combat and better space combat.",

In base game empire at war the empire has only a few ships (Tartan Cruiser, acclamator, victory,   Interdictor, imperial class, and SSD) all but one of those exist in canon and the tartan can be replaced by an  Arquitens or Gozanti. They might struggle to fill the rebel roster a little more but I still think it\u2019s entirely possible. \n\nFor ground troops again, I don\u2019t see many things they have in base EAW that they can\u2019t use in a canon remake. The rebels might need new vehicles but there\u2019d be additions such as the death troopers and purge troopers.",

And it seems fairly obvious that would\u2019ve been a Bounty Hunter sequel even if spiritually given popularity of Assassins Creed and even the Hitman games. This doesn\u2019t exist for some reason despite Baker and Morrison willing to come back for Fett practically anytime they\u2019ve asked.

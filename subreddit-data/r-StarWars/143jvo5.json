The point of her trying to learn the darksaber with Kanan was to show that she didn't need to be force sensitive to be proficient, and her using Ezra's lightsabers is a way to honor both their legacies.\n\nI'm reaching HIGH levels of hype for this series.",

Using it isn't as simple as just training and getting used to using it, like any other weapon, you have to almost synchronise with it. It's demonstrated multiple times that the Darksaber will usually become lighter and easier to wield or heavier and harder to wield depending on the wielder's conviction. Din Djarin never wanted the Darksaber, he couldn't wait to be rid of it, so it was always heavy and awkward to hold. Bo Katan, however, wanted to use the Darksaber to reunite the Mandalorians under one banner and lead her people into a new age, so the Darksaber always felt light, natural and easy to use. The Mandalorian \"thing\" is more the tradition that accompanies the Darksaber as opposed to a unique effect of the saber. In Mandalorian culture, the Darksaber is essentially Excalibur, in that whoever wields it is the true leader of the Mandalorians.",

And she has to learn from her experiences and mistakes. \n\nLike how she\u2019s leading a fighter squadron and dismisses orders to disengage the enemy because she\u2019s being overly confident in herself, and she falls right into a trap and gets basically everyone in her squadron killed. Then she has to grapple with the fact her hubris killed people for nothing. She constantly was learning, maturing, and growing as a character because that was the point of her all along",

They knew that having a brand new character show up and just be accepted into Obi-Wan and Anakin's circle would feel unearned to fans. So they gave her a character arc straight out of the gate. They made her a little bit arrogant and a little bit overconfident, which made fans pretty much instantly dislike her, but also were amplifications of some of the same character flaws in Anakin. Both were impulsive and made split second decisions based on a gut feeling, both disregarded Obi-Wan's instructions, and both were a little too cocky. But with Ahsoka, they showed what happened when she was wrong. She got clones killed because she assumed she knew better than her commanders and her Master. Ahsoka learned humility, and when she bounced back from that punishing defeat she fit right in as part of the team. In fact, Ahsoka overcame those character flaws while Anakin didn't, so in the end she still acted as a foil for him.",

I'm fine with them using all these elements from the Thrawn Trilogy provided the execution is solid, and that they actually include the OT characters, because why pull the plot from a story primarily about those characters if you're not going to involve them in any meaningful capacity. Plus it would make no sense if Luke didn't show up since he knows Ahsoka already and Thrawn is probably the biggest current threat to the Republic at this point.",

So long as they learn the content, stick to the formula, and just make appropriate changes here and there to make it fit into canon (so maybe a little bit of power nerfing, and small and subtle changes to the story so that it doesn't overwrite established canon) then most adaptations should work I think. Small and subtle  adjustments can go a long way.",

I definitely was under the impression that although pacifist at that point, as a whole they still stuck with the traditional mando garb aka armor etc outside of the Duchess. Based on googling those CW episodes I am certainly incorrect, the background Mandos don\u2019t appear to be in armor either besides the guards/security etc. \n\nI should rephrase to: Given we never saw Sabine out of armor previously, and haven\u2019t seen any mandos from this time frame sans armor I\u2019m very curious as to what\u2019s driving this image. Something small/situational plot wise or has Sabine perhaps shifted some of her views? It would not be the first time she \u201cbroke\u201d with some traditional Mando views or customs. Maybe she\u2019s forsaken the armor? Hidden it away as it was too much of a marker?",

I think the issue is the blade is narrower and there isn't as much of the arcing effect when it's being swung.\n\nCompare the duel on Mustafar to the duel in Obi-Wan to Luke's lightsaber in the Mandalorian for different degrees of it; Mustafar has a ton. Luke in Mando almost doesn't have any in some scenes.\n\nEdit - Comparing it to the originals the duel in Obi-Wan is probably the closest, actually. There's a bit of an arc but you don't regularly lose the blade's definition.",

It could be just the lighting and nature of this frame as well. \n\nEdit: You'll have to scroll through the article to see it, Reddit wouldn't let me share the image itself because the URL was shortened",

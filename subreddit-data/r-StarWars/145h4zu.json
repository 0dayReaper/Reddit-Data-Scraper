    "postText": "Is it knowing everything about the movies? Or simply watching them? Reading all the novels, watching all the shows, playing all the games etc?\n\nI'm mostly curious about other peoples opinions because I've been gatekept away from Star Wars for the last decade for not \"keeping up\" enough with the lore and everything there is. Basically my main love for the Star Wars universe is through Star Wars the Old Republic. Been playing that game for a long time and really love everything about it. However every Star Wars fan I've talked to haven't considered me a \"real fan\" because.. I don't know much about Yoda.. or Anakin.. or anything outside of this very specific game. I've watched the movies but not the shows, not read any novels etc. I'd easily fail a quiz that wasn't related to the Old Republic. There's also the fact that that game isn't considered canon anymore. So am I basically just an Old Republic fan instead of a real \"Star Wars fan\"? \n\nThis probably seems dumb and feels a bit dumb as I'm typing it.. Obviously if I enjoy it that's all there is to it. I'd probably 100% immerse myself in everything Star Wars that has been pushed out but I just don't have the time. Now it feels weird calling myself a fan and not knowing what planet Yoda was born on or something lmao.",

Plain and simple.\nMe personally I grew up with the original trilogy, loved the legends novels, collect action figures, pop vinyls and LEGO sets... That being said most of the new stuff I haven't been following... I've only just picked up the first high republic novel... And admittedly I'm not a huge fan of most of the Disney era product... But I enjoyed it enough to still consider myself a fan of the franchise.",

Read a bunch of EU books, new canon, and the high republic books. Watch all the shows, have four LEGO sets, 4 of the high quality lightsabers (shout out to my brother for those), have a May the Force be With You picture in my hallway, and a main character picture above my small wall with funko pops (none Star Wars, but an R2 Bluetooth speaker). And \u2026 I LIKE the sequel trilogy. Am I more involved and obsessed than you, sure. But we\u2019re both fans. Gate keeping is dumb. I\u2019m glad you enjoy the parts you enjoy.\n\nI\u2019m also a big Doctor Who fan, with at least 8 TARDIS related things around my house, and the wife and I watch it repeatedly. But I\u2019m not a \u201creal fan\u201d because I don\u2019t listen to the years worth of big finish audio books or read the comics or, dare I say, care about the show pre 2005. I don\u2019t care.\n\nFandom comes in every shape and size. I never played KOTOR and don\u2019t care to. *gasp!*",

I.e. if your character is in an alien space bar and orders the local special, bourbon isn't the right name, so make something up and then relate it to an existing drink. But if your character is just asking for a drink and the drink itself serves no importance in the scene, using an existing word, like bourbon or whiskey, is fine. Because in that case bringing in a word that reader doesn't understand at all just pulls you out of the story.",

There\u2019s a Clone Wars arc that goes into all of this, but if you\u2019d just like it summed up, basically there are two parts to the Force: The Living Force and the Cosmic Force. The Living Force is generated by living beings and through the midichlorians connects to the Cosmic Force. When a living thing dies, it passes from the Living Force into the Cosmic Force, losing its individual identity to become one with the Cosmic Force. It\u2019s implied that this is what happens to all life, regardless of whether they are Jedi, Sith, sentient, or just a plant. What Qui Gon and Yoda are able to learn how to do is to retain their identities after death, and they of course pass this on to Obi Wan, who passes it on to Luke, who passes it on to Leia and it seems Ben and maybe all his other students. So, in a way yeah, there is an afterlife in Star Wars that everyone goes to, but you won\u2019t be you unless you learn how to retain your identity, which seems to be something only Jedi or more accurately light side users are capable of.",

She's listing off reasons that society or her parents would use to pressure her into not doing the thing she does want to do.

Then in Battlefront 2 EA you see a lot of then and more near this time. BUT when I played Star Wars Resistance my decepcion was bigger than the Death Star, the new MonCa ship from Rogue One replaced the role of my favourite ship. Dont get me grong the new Mon cala ships are always great, but i think that the classic One its more similar to a star destroyer that the new model.\n\nBUT the omission of the Home One in the new Games and series its a crime. Where I can see the Home One in the new canon????",

What they should have done is have the First Order be a rising presence in TFA. Make the First Order be percieved by the main charatcters as \"It's probably an old imperial faction, shouldn't worry much about it, probably just some old Imperial Official who doesn't want to get arrested, we'll keep it on our rader but not worry too much about it\" Since the First Order would be a rising threat and not a threat already going on before the movie, that could have explained why the New Republic didn't have much of an army. Next, throughout the movie we would see the New Republic, which would be based upon corresuant, notice large shipments of supplies and transmit movements going to what they would not know at the time, Starkiller Base. They could also have the First Order attack planets very fall away from New Republic control, with the locals once being questioned after the First Order left, call the First Order \"stormtroopers\". Again, the New Republic would wonder about how many old Imperial factions still exist. This would continue with Leia talking to the Senate about expanding the defenses of the planet and expanding the army, as they have noticed a rise of rogue Imperial attacks, from what they still assume is old remaining factions. At this point, the New Republic starts monitoring fleet transits to \"StarKiller Base\" and decide to set up base. Tave had a large fleet go offworld to set up a base near Starkiller Base that would observe the massive planetery station, which at this point would be a \"what the hell, how did they create that entire thing right under our noses, we had no idea these guys existed\". At that once, they should have had Starkiller Base fire upon Coresuant, killing everyone except the main characters. The First Order would then send a transmission to every planet they can, doing the cliche villian monologue of \"Blah blah blah, your government is dead, be scared, we're coming folks\". Then, this New Republic fleet which had set up base on a planet near Starkiller Base would become the Resistence. Boom. And that sounds much better than the current plot.",

In that draft, Palpatine would reveal that in a twisted way, he is Anakin's father.\n\nObviously this was scrapped, so it's dubious whether it's really canon, but it sounds like it was at least Lucas' headcanon.",

In a 2009 interview, Baker said that he originally thought it was just him that Daniels didn't like, but \"he doesn't get along with anyone.\"\n\n&gt;Plus, Baker said he once approached Daniels about touring as their characters to make money and \"he looked down his nose at me like I was a piece of sh*t. He said: 'I don't do many of these conventions\u2014go away little man.' He really degraded me and made me feel small.\"\n\n&gt;While the film may show an unbreakable friendship, they hardly talked to each other during filming. Said Baker again, \"We were both in our droids; there was no interconnection at all. We couldn't hear or see each other.\"",

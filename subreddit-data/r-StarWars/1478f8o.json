I found this out by research since i didnt remembered the scene in the review. I am confused because i am following this watch order [https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/smh0cj/how\\_to\\_watch\\_star\\_wars\\_a\\_guide\\_for\\_new\\_comers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/smh0cj/how_to_watch_star_wars_a_guide_for_new_comers/) and in this list ,The Book of Boba Fett  comes after the manadalorian. How can a scene be in the review of episode 17 from a series which was released 2 years after?! My whole experience is ruined now i am quitting disney plus\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: i am stupid, i guess season 3 was released after The Book of Boba Fet",

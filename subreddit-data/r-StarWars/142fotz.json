I honestly think it will be a new character who is dealt with in a couple of episodes. The inquisitors, with the exception of the grand inquisitor, were scrubs in Star Wars Rebels.

In the case of Starkiller it\u2019s a sensible choice as there is no way of bringing him back without changing him so much that he basically becomes an unrecognisable character who happens to have the same name. Best to just move on and make new characters.",

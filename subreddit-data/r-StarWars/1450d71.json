The only thing that would be a positive is that we'd get more proper adult content like Andor, but even that would come with a bunch of grimdark tryhard bullshit that sucks, because their only plan is \"throw literally everything at a wall and mix up what sticks\".",

Case in point: Disney edited out the racist parts of Fantasia and pretends Song of the South doesn\u2019t exist, whereas WB still shows their older racist cartoons but with the text \u201cthis is a product of it\u2019s time\u201d in the beginning. Meaning WB would most likely have no problem releasing the original unaltered trilogy and they wouldn\u2019t have let Rian Johnson completely change the character of Luke and kill off the original cast members.",

The hero that was there on screen when I first watched it in the 70's, alongside Obi-Wan, but the one who was young and exciting next to the mysterious old man.   The one who inspired so many hours of play with the toys in the years the followed.  Definitely Luke. Obi wan isn't far behind mind.",

When the prequels were just coming out and prices of old action figures were skyrocketing, I saw that one of my old original Luke was now worth $100, and if it were in the packaging, well over $1,000. \n\nI thought, \"Dang! If only I could have kept it in the packaging!\" But then I thought, \"Naw, I got WAY more than $1,000 of fun and adventures with him.\"\n\nThinking about it more, I think my second is Jyn Erso. True, we don't get nearly as much time with her, but I think she's a great character with a good message.",

That's 7 seasons of content that didn't have Luke in it.\n\n\nI had disregarded the series because it was released as animation and the first episodes were kind of low quality. What a huge mistake on my part because it provides an invaluable examination on who Anakin really is. A key aspect of Anakin's mindset that was formed by trauma really hits home on the extremes he put his padawan, Ahsoka, through on her training. She was really young but he did things like having her surrounded by clones pouring in relentless blaster fire set on stun. She was shot and knocked unconscious over and over again but he refused to let up until she could defend herself. \n\nSome would call that abuse but if Anakin hadn't been so extreme Ahsoka never would've survived Order 66. \n\nThat scene was an allegory for what Anakin was willing to do for his loved ones. The same with what he was willing to do to protect Padme. As Vader he said \"Asteroids do not concern me Admiral\"  and he meant it because he was going to do anything, suffer anything, remove any obstacle to get to his son. \n\nDo I still see Luke as a hero? Hell yeah. It's one reason why I was so disgusted by what Kathleen Kennedy did to his character arc. There's no way Luke would abandon his friends or kill his nephew in his sleep.",

I think his arc and story were too short to be called the protagonist of Rebels, but his influence on Ezra is part of what made Ezra such an incredible Jedi to begin with. I would love to see a backstory and learn more about Kanan, but I think once he went blind it was really the heart and soul of his character arc right there and there isn\u2019t much you can do to show him in his prime again in a different series without diving into a multiverse style series.

He's also the most consistently well written and well acted character (inching slightly ahead of Han and Leia due to to the throne room scene). \n\nHis story is also fantastic, you see true growth from a kid, to a warrior and finally a true Jedi. Leia was a politicians daughter and had been an important part of the resistance prior to us seeing her in episode 4. Her becoming a commander and leader isn't that much of a stretch. Hans a rogue, but shows his heart early on and arguably remains the same character from start to finish. \n\nI would say Anakin as his fall/redemption arc is more impressive and Darth Vader is such a fantastic character but to be honest, his writing and Haydens acting drip him down several rungs.",

Han Solo (Gotta say, I liked Han in the OG Trilogy, but Solo really won me over. Got me to see him from a completely new point of view and I grew to love him.)\n3. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Best part of his own show, I loved getting more insight as to what he was thinking during this part of his life. Always loved him prior to this show as well.)\n4. Luke Skywalker (Good arc. Not super attached to him in the OG Trilogy, but he had a good story and I still like him.)\n5. Rey Skywalker (Rise of Skywalker sucks, but I was very invested in her prior to that movie. Gets bonus points due to Last Jedi being my favourite movie.)\n6. Hunter (Kind of overshadowed by the rest of the Bad Batch, but consistently brings the feels when he needs to.)\n7. Cassian Andor (Amazingly written show, but Cassian isn't the most interesting as of yet.)\n8. Din Djarin (Gonna be honest, I never really cared for Mando. He was far from bad but he didn't leave a lasting impression on me.)\n9. Ezra Bridger (Had some great parts, but was annoying for most of the series.)\n10. Jyn Erso (Completely neutral, didn't care about him in the slightest.)\n11. Boba Fett (Could not care less about his story or character here. He's always been far too over the place.)\n12.

            "comment": "Anakin doesn't turn to the dark side but Palpatine kills Padme and unknown to Anakin, the baby survived. Palpatine kidnaps Luke and raises him him as his new apprentice.\n\nIn his grief, Anakin becomes a hermit on Tatooine. For decades, Obi-Wan fails to convince Anakin to rejoin the fight. But when an Alderanean Princess messages Obi-Wan to help in their struggle, Obi-Wan answers the call but is slain on the Death Star by Palatine's powerful apprentice.\n\nThe loss of his former master is the motivation Anakin needs. He decides he must confront Palpatine and his apprentice and rescue the princess who knows the location of the Death Star plans.\n\nAnakin comes face to face with the apprentice and shows himself to be the superior dualist. But just as Anakin is set to deal the fatal blow, the apprentice reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker, the survived child of Padme. Anakin is stunned by this revelation. Luke uses this distraction to gain the upper hand and lops off one of Anakin's limbs. Anakin retreats by flinging himself down a chasm.\n\nWhat will Anakin do? 'I can't kill my own son' he explains to master Yoda on Dagobah. Will Anakin find the courage to face Luke again? Will he be tempted by the dark side a second time or lured by his son's offer to overthrow Palpatine and rule as father and son? What will happen when they both learn the true identity of Princess Leia?\n\nTune into an alternate universe to find out!",

Was she randomly attacked elsewhere and they c-sectioned them and for some reason bail was around to to pick up leia? How much time is between the murder of padme and the kidnapping of the twins that Anakin had zero idea about any of it, and also nobody else seems to have been told? How did the empire just miss that there was another baby with them and the alderanians were involved? \n\nThe rest of the ideas interesting but how we get the split twins but somehow leias still in OTL positions weak.",

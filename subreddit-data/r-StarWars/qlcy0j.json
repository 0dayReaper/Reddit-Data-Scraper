You know, the person who hid the plans and sent them to Obi-Wan, who got everyone out of the detention center, who realized that the Falcon was being tracked back to Yavin, who stayed as long as possible at Hoth to make sure everyone evacuated, who risked her life to save Han at Jabba's palace, who made first contact with the Ewoks to enlist them for help, who learned to use the force in her own way to save herself and her son...the woman who, without her, the Empire would have destroyed the Rebellion and won.....you mean that woman?",

You know, as though that moment somehow negatively defines her whole character. Um, yes, she was captured, put in chains, slapped into a skimpy object, and treated as an object. AND SHE LITERALLY TOOK THOSE FUCKING CHAINS AND STRANGLED THE PERSON WHO DID IT TO HER WITH THEM. TO DEATH. SHE KILLED JABBA OUTRIGHT WITH THE EXACT CHAINS HE'D PUT ON HER TO TREAT HER AS A THING. Why the fuck are people using one of her absolute most badass moments as an insult?",

Even the more background characters, like the dozen other pilots of Red and Rogue Squadron and the line-up of bounty hunters in Empire, were cool enough to have their own action figures. And they were *all* men (or in the case of the droids, used male pronouns).\n\nSo who did the female fans have for role models?\n\n* Leia, the badass we all know and love\n* Mon Mothma, I guess\n\nIt was slim pickings. Leia was incredible, but when literally 99% of the cast is male, it's not hard to see how the movies weren't exactly geared towards girls, at least not nearly to the extent that they were made to appeal to boys.",

He knew too well he was a damn good pilot. On Leia's side, she was raised a princess. She had access to almost anything she would want or need, and was used to more respect than a smuggler wanted to give. So she slung insults about his ego, because his ego was as puffed as her own. She did plenty as an operative and leader among the Rebels, yes, and she knew it too. They pushed each others boundaries, and that's what made their chemistry spark.",

I've read the planned script for Duel of the Fates and his story was so good in that, it would've been a worthwhile end to his arc.\n\nI feel so bad for Daisy Ridley. I adore her as Rey, she played it so well, being the excited orphan who is just so happy to get to be part of the action. She did such a good job and she's such a great actress and she feels completely wasted now because Disney seems to be distancing themselves from the sequels. I desperately want her to come back and go on more adventures. I would love a Rey series to explore the universe post-First Order but after what she went through why would she or John ever work for Disney again?",

Discrimination and exclusion of women from gamer or nerd/geek culture was the norm, as well as stereotyping girls as not interested in things like sci-fi, or good at or even enjoy video games.",

Hard to tell if true friend since she had these pictures on the internet for so long. But that's where that came from.\n\nHer claim was she just watched the movie a ton of times and literally sketched it out there.  Hard to not believe her as she is one of the premiere best homemade costumers (pre-2000s's cosplay) of her time.

Do you even KNOW what the \"TIE\" in \"TIE Fighter\" stands for?\" It was practically a meme and for a second I didn't even think he was serious but he stood there waiting with this smarmy ass grin like he was going to \"out\" me as a fraud in front of other nerds.\n\nI was like \"Uh, it's twin ion engine dude...\" and he just  walked away. It was one of the most bizarre encounters I've had at a convention.\n\nThen there was at Target just trying to check out when a guy noticed my porg bag clip and said to me \"Oh, a FEMALE Star Wars fan! That's RARE!\" Like I was some commodity he wanted to get ahold of. The way he said it was just really creepy. He proceeded to beg me to join his local costuming group.\n\nAnd throughout the 9 years I've been with my (now) husband he and I have both been told numerous times how lucky HE IS (not me! HIM!) to have a girl who \"likes\" Star Wars.

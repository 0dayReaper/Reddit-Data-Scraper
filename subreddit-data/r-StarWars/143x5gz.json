    "postText": "I had an idea today that it\u2019d be Interesting if you could achieve an alternative ending if you refused to \u201cEmbrace the Darkness\u201d in your final fight with Bode. It\u2019d be a \u201clight side/good\u201d ending like they have in the mass effect trilogy. Maybe have it so that ending would save Bode or something along those lines.",

            "comment": "I like the idea and it could have been enriched if Cal faced such decisions throughout the game that influenced his willingness and ability to tap into the dark side in that final fight or find more strength in the light, similar to how decisions in Witcher 3 determine the ending. It would be a little tricky for Respawn wrt the final game in the trilogy, but there are ways it could have been done.",

Stuff like how you use the Jedi mind trick on people, let you choose if you kill the imperial base commander, if they had a \u201cfleeing/surrendering enemy\u201d feature they could make it if you killed them it\u2019d count towards your darkness. \nThey could either just have a \u201cCanon\u201d ending or sync your actions from the previous games",

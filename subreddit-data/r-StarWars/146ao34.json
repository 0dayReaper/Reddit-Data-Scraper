            "comment": "This is my full 3.75\" scale build of a TIE Defender model based off an Esty seller - highly recommended if you want to build models in this scale! The HASBRO Vintage line does have some good models such as the TIE Fighter and X-Wing (the former of which is shown for comparison). The print quality of the 3D Printing does lend itself to a more realistic \"model\" finish, and gives off a better matte finish than the plastic Hasbro TIE and X-Wing. The Wings itself are also better secured with screws in the mold allowing for assembly and secure display. For reference it's about 18\" by 18\" in scale, not quite as tall as the TIE Fighter but looks bigger overall!",

            "comment": "The X-Wing series of books doesn't feature any of the big names you're interested in, but they're great stories and worthy of your attention.\n\nIf you really want to focus in on the Jade/Skywalker/Solo storylines, I'd suggest *Jedi Search* next. It's right after the Thrawn trilogy so you won't be skipping ahead too far. It's primarily Luke-focused, but Mara is around, and eventually the Solo twins make an impact.\n\nJedi Search is part 1 of the Jedi Academy Trilogy. The whole trilogy is good, but to get the \"full story\" told you'll want to also read *I, Jedi*, which all but necessitates reading the X-Wing series.\n\nIf you want to get a full dose of the Solo children, pick up the Corellian Trilogy, beginning with *Ambush at Corellia*.",

            "comment": "&gt; mara jade\n\ntaken from another thread, some are more mara important than others. \n\n* I, Jedi by Michael Stackpole, which is a replacement/addition to the jedi academy trilogy, so you'll want that too. \n\n* The New Rebellion by Kristine Kathryn Rusch\n\n* The Corellian trilogy by Roger MacBride Allen\n\n* Hand of Thrawn duology (Specter of the Past, and Vision of the Future) by Timothy Zahn. \n\n* Union comic by Michael Stackpole\n\n* Survivors Quest by Timothy Zahn\n\n* New Jedi Order series by various authors (she's a big character in many of the 19 books here)\n\n* swarm war\n\n* legacy of the force \n\n&gt; Lea/han/jacen solo etc?\n\nFor Han and Leia... i mean really all? They come up a lot in basically all of the EU. \n\nFor the solo children, \n\n* Dark Empire\n\n* Crystal Star (don't read it but the solo kids first really appear here)\n\n* the corellian trilogy (they first really become meaningful characters)\n\n* the young and junior jedi knight series, about jacen-jaina in jedi high school and then anakin solo in jedi middle school\n\n* new jedi order et all from above",

            "comment": "This is the order we made my mom do:\n\nThrawn Trilogy, Jedi Academy trilogy, X-Wing 9 book Series, Courtship of Princess Leia, I Jedi, Hand of Thrawn Duology.\n\nIt features most of the big universe defining events that happen post ROTJ in a fairly linear storyline.  Lots of Mara Jade and main trilogy characters.\n\nAs their own serials that can be read independently, I would recommend:\n\nHan Solo trilogy by Crispin, basically the Solo movie done EU style.  How Han learned to fly, where he learned to smuggle, how he met Chewie, how he got the Falcon, why he is so negative in politics and the rebels, why Jabba is so mad at him.\n\nCorellian Trilogy, follows the Han Solo trilogy very nicely, but can be read first.  Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin\u2019s first book where they are old enough to have their own agency and adventure.\n\nYoung Jedi Knights, Jacen and Jaina and their teen friends learn to become Jedi Knights.  YA, but it holds up really wells as a fast fun read.",

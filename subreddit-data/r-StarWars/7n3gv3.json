All for fun in good spirits. \n\nAnyway, the drummer of the opening band begins playing, and he's great. His drumming is extremely even and his improvisation skills are fantastic, as he flails his arms wildly and quickly. It's impressive to watch, hearing these drum rhythms and watching his whole body move with it. It looks like what he's doing takes immense physical labor, and I'm impressed.\n\nBut then he ends and Carey begins to play roughly the same improvisation, and my jaw drops. It sounded equally as amazing, perhaps a bit cleaner, but the impressive part was that he looked like he was barely moving at all while playing this incredibly fast piece. He looked calm, back straight with good posture, his shoulders berely pivoting, all his movements were in his wrists and elbows pretty much. Carey was making the former drummer's part look easy, the same part that he appeared to have been struggling to get it perfect. Carey probably could've done it one-handed.\n\nMy point is that Ray Park appears to be an utmost professional, a master of his craft.",

His drumming is extremely even and his improvisation skills are fantastic, as he flails his arms wildly and quickly. It's impressive to watch, hearing these drum rhythms and watching his whole body move with it. It looks like what he's doing takes immense physical labor, and I'm impressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But then he ends and Carey begins to play roughly the same improvisation, and my jaw drops. It sounded equally as amazing, perhaps a bit cleaner, but the impressive part was that he looked like he was barely moving at all while playing this incredibly fast piece. He looked calm, back straight with good posture, his sho\n\nam a  drummer. Can confirm a couple things. Carey is god... and i can play MUCH MUCH MUCH more complex these days with little visible effort, whereas my younger self would sweat and flail wildly to achieve the same effect. Efficiency comes with precision comes with practice comes with time.",

This is Kylo\u2019s trilogy not Snoke\u2019s, I just hope the new EU sheds more light on his backstory in the future.",

Probably not Qui-Gon, though... he just got lucky. \n\nThe Savage/Maul and Dooku fight in TCW was probably my favorite SW fight to date due to the stakes, reasons, and what brought those characters together. On a side note it\u2019s the shame that TCW eclipsed the prequels in the way they did. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m upset that TCW was good, I\u2019m upset that we didn\u2019t get that level of quality, story, action, and depth of characters in the movies. I am however glad we got TCW because it fixed a lot of plot holes and issues with the prequels. Almost everything was addressed. ",

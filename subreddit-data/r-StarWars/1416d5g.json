Just seeing what a more normal profession would work like in the Star Wars universe (eg: farming) is interesting, but they are also great at picking unique \"jobs\" that take it to the next level (eg: scavenger, knight, mob boss). \n\nI think an urban SWAT team similar to Dredd in Coruscant would be interesting to focus on!",

Given that we've never seen saber fights where one party slides their blade up/down to take off the other person's fingers, it seems safe to assume that for whatever reason (maybe the magnetic fields lock somehow on each clash?) that's just not something you need to worry about in that setting.\n\nThat High Republic lightsaber is absolutely sweet looking, definitely a higher status weapon. But Kylo's seems to be more useful in practice.",

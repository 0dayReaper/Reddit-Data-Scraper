I hate the low hanging fruit jokes but it's mostly true I guess. The movie is a mess of good and bad ideas.\n\n&gt;They say he was cloned but his body looks like it's been reanimated.\n\nWell most likely the attempts to clone him started toward the end of his life and I wouldn't be shocked if the dark-side possession of the clone body made him immobile as he was.\n\n&gt;You'd think that a fresh body would look a little less like a corpse...\n\nThere's a bunch of head canon explanations you can conjur up for this.\n\nI prefer the idea that due to the dark-side essence possessing the clone body, it aged him to where he would be if he survived ROTJ and his body was breaking down. It's possible he would have died naturally not long afterward without some sort of help.\n\nHe drains the life-force from Rey/Kylo (which he couldn't do without both of them there, for whatever reason involving the force dyad) and I think that gives him temporary mobility but father time comes for us all and he was probably only going to last long enough to re-establish the Empire, thus his need for Rey to become his successor.",

We know many of the original inquisitors were younglings that weren't fully indoctrinated by the Jedi, or less powerful Jedi sent to the service corps that were given a \"second chance\" by the Inquisitorious. Since these were, on average, less powerful force wielders, the spinning blade was a cheap way to make them appear more threatening. True masters could get the same defensive benefits of a spinning lightsaber through mastery of the force, and appropriate training. What the inquisitors did was a cheap imitation.",

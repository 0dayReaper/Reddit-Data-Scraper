Personally though I found the force itself more relatable to taosim, which was a hugely popular thing in the 70s, and there your view i just. I prefer your view, but it might  ot be what George intended. Star Wars grew past him a long time ago though.\n\nAt least since the prequals and KOTOR series I feel the jedi to be more aligned to buddism, but also to be in the wrong, especially pre-order-66, just like they in 4k bby were in the wrong not to help against the mandalorians (again personal opinion). Their fear of the dark side leads to apathy which in itself could be considered evil, and imo caused revan and malak to go bad more so than their choices did. Crossing universes here, but tom holland spider man says it nice when he say something alin to \"if tou can do the things i can do, and not help,, it is almost like you did the evil act\"\n\nRambling here, but I agree anakin caused balance when he executed order 66, and yoda eludes to it with his \" a prophecy that misread could have been\". But george probably meant otherwise. Art is art though, and its in the eye of the beholder, if tou consider star wars art.",

Jedi strive for peace. Imo balance is to strive for peace without disalowing emotion. Striving for feeling, loving, without letting the emotions consume you.

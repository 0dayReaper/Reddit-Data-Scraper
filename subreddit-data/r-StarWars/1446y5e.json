How do i watch these movies, do i watch it in the order of how they released or chronological order. If its in chronological order then what is the correct order? Do I skip any movies which are not required, outdated, or just plain bad?",

            "comment": "I'll paste a comment I made about this in another thread:\n\n\"Start with Solo: A Star Wars story.\n\nHear me out:\nI've got three different adult friends/colleagues to watch Star Wars for the first time in this order, and all of them saw every movie, and liked the order I told then to watch in. \n\nSo here's the order:\n\n1. SOLO\nSmall scale and works on it's own. A recent production, so new viewers who don't have the nostalgia lens on won't have to bare with the first 30 mins having droids as the main characters. It's a fun watch, but also introduces key elements like the Empire, and a tiny intro to the Rebellion in the end. This makes the ending tie in to Rogue One a bit, answering \"What? Rebels? Who are the Rebels?\" type of questions.\n\n2. ROGUE ONE\nHere we broaden the scale, with a lot more action and see a lot more of the galaxy. We get out first taste of space battles, a great soundtrack and overall a broader understanding to what the Empire and Rebellion is. We also get the killer ending (pun intended), where the first introduction to a lightsaber is the hallway scene (instead of it being introduced as \"the cool glowstick your dad left you\". Also it introduces Vader in a way so that when we see him in Ep4 where a bit more frightened (since the last time that guy entered a hallway, shit went down).\n\nI think introducing new people with two new movies where the scale is gradually increased gets them hooked more easily, because then elements of the old movies are familiar, and will be easier to appreciate. \n\n3. EPISODE 4 AND 5\nThe ending of Rogue One and intro to Ep4 are meant to be together. So with that, and the fact that Ep4 now will have some \"nostalgia\" of it's own when the viewer gets to see Han, Chewie, the Falcon a lightsaber, Vader etc makes the movie easier to get into. Also, to hear John Williams for the first time should be quite noticable. \n\nFrom here on out it's the machete order. And I think it's a good order as long as the new viewer gets the explaination of why seeing ep 1-3 will elaborate some stuff about Vader being Lukes dad etc. So the order from here is:\n\nEpisode 1-3, \nEpisode 6, \nEpisode 7-9.\n\nPersonally, nowadays I always watch in this order. I feel it works so well, and from the feedback I got from the people I recommended it too I feel it's one of the best orders for introducing adults to Star Wars.\"",

                            "comment": "I still disagree, there's more reasons than \"saving spoilers\" to start with the original trilogy (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi). As much as George Lucas likes to say that he wanted people to watch them chronologically, when making the Prequels, he took for granted how much lifting the OT did with laying out the setting and themes. This isn't a knock on the Prequels. I think you just have a better chance of enjoying them if you watch the Original Trilogy first, then the Prequels, then the Sequels. Then the two anthology films. From there, it's kinda open ended what you want to get into and where you want to start from. The shows/comics/novels are vast and interconnected, but a lot of them don't require having consumed more than the movies, so it's more where your interests lie.",

For that reason, I'd start with the original trilogy, the movies from 1977 - 1983. They are the most relevant, and, as many find, the best of them. Understand what's good about Star Wars before watching the more flawed trilogies.\n\nThe Disney trilogy (2015 - 2019) contains a lot of recycled plot from the original, so I'd suggest continuing with the prequel trilogy (1999 - 2005) instead. After that, just watch whatever you feel like watching, the order won't matter much.\n\nIf you watch them in the exact order they were released, you get better insight into the history of the franchise and its movie making.",

            "comment": "Like many have said, you should watch them in release order (4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9). There are a few reasons. The first is just visual and technological fidelity. For some it\u2019s very jarring to go from lower tech special effects to modern special effects. Two, the plot points of the 1, 2, and 3 are not as impactful if you don\u2019t know where things are going. It\u2019s an explanation of how the bad stuff happens and doesn\u2019t matter as much if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s at stake. The sequel trilogy just isn\u2019t as good, but they\u2019re fun while you are watching them. Turn your brain off and it\u2019s fun. \n\nIf you are so inclined I would recommend watching rogue one after watching the prequels to tie together the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy in a meaningful way. \n\nAfter that, if you crave more I would recommend watching Andor as that is a prequel show to Rogue One that is honestly some of the best tv I\u2019ve seen regardless of your love for Star Wars. \n\nMandalorian is fun if you want more. If you need more context for the Mandalorian you can watch the various animated series if you wish to do so but it isn\u2019t required, but much of the future of Star Wars will be pulling from this material in the future. \n\nYou can skip Solo unless you\u2019re a die hard and just need to know (believe me, you really don\u2019t). The Boba Fett show is basically the Mandalorian season 2.5 if you feel compelled.",

            "comment": "First time watching all of them through, go in release order. That's the way many watched them, and in a way, the \"intended\" way to see them.\n\nIf you like them and want to rewatch them, go in chronological order. You'll pick up all kinds of connections and details you didn't see the first time when the events are in order.\n\nI would also encourage you to include the 2 anthology movies Rogue One and Solo, especially in a chronological marathon. They add all kinds of information and details.\n\nIf you want to do the TV shows, there's an order to them as well.\n\nFor animated shows, watch Clone Wars then Bad Batch. Rebels comes after Episode 3 and before Episode 4, and Resistance takes place before, then during, Episodes 7-9.\n\nFor live action, it's Mandalorian seasons 1 and 2, Book of Boba Fett, then Mandalorian season 3. Andor take place after 3 and before Rogue One, and Kenobi takes place after Solo, and before 4.\n\nIf you want to watch everything in purely chronological order, follow [this](https://www.thepopverse.com/star-wars-movies-shows-watch-order-release-chronological) guide. This is because the Clone Wars TV show itself is not in chronological order, and some TV shows have season in different places.\n\nAlso, pro tip, you'll notice guides reference \"BBY\" and \"ABY\". This refers to Before Battle of Yavin, and After Battle of Yavin. It's how Star Wars places things on a timeline. The Battle of Yavin is an event in New Hope, the first movie made.",

Shock horror for alot of people i know.\n\nBut my thinking is the newer films are just more nostalgic mirrors than a continuation of the narrative, and in the long run may work in the favour of narrative satisfaction. There might have a few spoilers here and there but may just be more of a fun teaser and then you can jump into the main story going 4,5,6,1,2,3\n\nWhatever you do avoid the machete order.",

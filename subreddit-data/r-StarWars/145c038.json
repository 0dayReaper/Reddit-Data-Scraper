In AotC, Obi-Wan's message, if intercepted, will only reveal his location: a trained Jedi Knight. In TPM, if the message is intercepted and decoded, a whole group of people are exposed, none of whom can defend themselves with the abilities of a Jedi.",

They would be actively searching for transmissions compatible with Nubian communications systems; because the ship didn't arrive on Coruscant in any timely fashion, they could reasonably assume the hyperdrive core was damaged, so that narrows down the section of the galaxy the have to scan for such transmissions. And, once they intercept the transmission, they don't have to know what it says to trace it back to its origin. \n\nLastly, they found the starship by sending it a message; they traced where their message went  and Darth Maul was sent to the system that received it, something Obi-Wan didn't seem to think about when advising Captain Panaka not to reply.",

He scrambles it, so that while people can tell there was a transmission, they don't know what it was, until they crack the encryption.\n\nIn TPM, there were in a ship that was being pursued, and they knew that the Trade Federation was specifically looking for them. A transmission from Tatooine to Coruscant would be notable, so sending the transmission would give the TF a lead on where to look.",

For all the parts and fabric this costume is VERY reasonable. Costumes of that magnitude are often picked up by 501st members (that's a whole thing don't get me started), which is under LFL/Disney's \"jurisdiction\". So they see it as volunteers spending their own money to advertise their IP for free.\n\nThis could change at any time and they would be within their legal rights to shut all small costume shops down. But for now they're \"allowed\"",

Got tickets again this year a few months back when vaccines had just come out and before delta was a thing.\n\nEnded up canceling again because no way in hell I'm gonna go walk around a convention center full of dirty spread necks, plus every celeb I cared to meet cancelled aside from 1. And the photos theyre doing look ridiculous because fan and celeb is separated by a pane of plexiglass.\n\nHappy that they are enforcing masks and taking other precautions but having a con now is just a bad idea",

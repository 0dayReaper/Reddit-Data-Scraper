It\u2019s like everything he touches eventually includes fanservice appearances from major characters regardless of whether they really needed to or not.",

That may be true of any franchise, but Star Wars has experienced some of the worst of it. There are problems in the sequel Trilogy caused by genuinely poor writing etc. but most of it is a failure to appreciate what makes Star Wars tick. The best of Star Wars is when writers like Kasdan (ESB), Zhan (Thrawn), or Gilroy honor what works and then expand into new territory.",

Everyone puts weight on life and death for a character, but her being an established character and Cassian having a known end to his story the tension wasn't \"are they going to die?\" but instead \"what thing gets them from their current position to where I recognize them?\"\n\nAndor we know strictly as an established rebel in Rogue One and Mon Mothma about the same but leadership.\n\nThere is too much modern show writing based on life or death situations that it's refreshing to see a character make it out of a series or story if it's a prequel and any characters you know the fate of are just \"safe\" and new characters are expendable fodder.",

That PTSD of guilt is what ultimately could have given connection to Obi-Wan,  if he too were suffering from the guilt around not being able to save everyone.\n\nThat she has this ill fated plan to avenge her Youngling friends but she is secretly conflicted about how to go about it. \n\nReva using more of a calculated approach ala Deedra in Andor, would have also made more sense.

Whilst the fact they are ruthless serial killers ups the ante into making them extremely dangerous, almost all of them wind up dead due to their inability to control their emotions. I think the writing is fine in that respect. \n\n\nYou are correct with the miscast. Moses Ingram gives off more of a pouty face in a lot of scenes trying to look hyperviolent. She was nominated for an Emmy for a previous role and has the technical experience for a supporting role. Seems that playing a double crossing villain (antihero?) just wasn\u2019t really suited to her skill set.",

Even if arcs in the comics, especially his own, are fairly lengthy, the actual events of a particular issue are far shorter.  And, being comics, the particular issues that focus or rely on him can reliably dial up his power to actually make him out to be the threat he was believed to be.  \n\nBut dedicating an entire show to him, especially after the fact that both the prequel and original trilogies put focus on parts of his journey, would definitely lose much of the mystique and appeal for Vader.  Like you said, his cameos in various large appeal mediums that he's appeared in has not only been good, but also well recieved.  After all, look at the reception to his cameos in Rebels, Rogue One, and Jedi Fallen Order.  They were all well recieved, they all worked to build upon his allure, and they were just right for those various entries.  Anything more in them could very well undo that allure and reputation.",

Great ways to do a Star Wars RPG campaign. \n\nHere\u2019s one that was a huge success at my table: what if R2 and C-3PO are shot down over Tattoine with the death star plans?\n\nThey never make it to Luke and Ben, who aren\u2019t alerted and don\u2019t jump onto the Falcon and head to Alderaan, don\u2019t rescue Leia, don\u2019t take the plans to Yavin 4. \n\nSo extrapolate: Leia is tortured continuously by Vader, and eventually breaks, giving up Yavin 4 and falling to the dark side. Vader recognizes her Force potential and trains her as his apprentice. Eventually they figure out their actual relationship. \n\nMeanwhile, Ben is alerted for the first time when Alderaan is destroyed and abandons Luke, heading out to find the Rebellion, but fails to find it after Leia gives up Yavin 4. He returns to Tattoine, collects Luke, heads to Dagobah and he and Yoda start his training. Eventually Ben leaves to found a new Rebellion led by himself as General while Luke trains with Yoda. \n\nMeanwhile, seeking dominance for himself and his daughter / apprentice whom he dubs Darth Fury, Vader kills Tarkin and turns the Death Star on Coruscant when the Emperor is still on the surface, declaring himself Emperor and ruling the galaxy from the Death Star with a ruthless fist. \n\nTwo years pass. The Rebellion is mostly on the run, but is gathering strength as Vader upsets more of the galaxy with each planet he destroys. More importantly, Jedi Knight Luke has finished his training and, armed with the truth about his father and sister, has set out to stop them no matter the cost. Ben and Yoda want Luke to kill them, considering them lost forever, but Luke thinks there might just be another way\u2026",

So why not make this the season all about his cave \u201ctest\u201d so to speak, being his force ghost training, perhaps having to look back on his life to come to peace with an unease in his mind; that he never actually chose the Jedi life for himself, given away by parents without knowing why, raised as a monk/soldier not unlike the clones he commanded. \n\nWe\u2019ve spent the entire saga on the special Jedi outliers and their hero journeys. But Obiwan, the prototypical Jedi, the product of devotion to the Jedi way, is the best character to explore the actual themes of sacrifice and lack of agency that every Jedi experiences. I mean we still haven\u2019t seen the real day in the life of being raised as a Jedi youngling at the temple. Who better than the first on screen Jedi to show us this. \n\nWith no more Order around to enforce consequences, this would be Obi-Wan\u2019s true test of discovering what his own beliefs truly are. Would he go and be with a Satine now? Why or why not. Will he choose to regurgitate everything he learned for Luke, or perhaps take a page outta his masters book and truly decide for himself what he thinks about the rules?",

He was sitting next to a driving seet of a garbage truck.\n\nThe series was pretty bad, on every account, even the cgi was abysmall.\n\nChange in showrunners is a must. They missed a big mark on how to deal with getting cut from the order how every single person that you have known is no more and the child that you protect is the only hope, kenobi in forefront protecting the child from empire. Instead we got what we got. I wouldnt mind it when it would have a good script. Just the thought that they made kenobi john wick is so stupid. And this is just a tip of the iceberg of that season",

It would absolve Season 1\u2019s many flaws in my opinion.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I loved much of the first season. It even included one of my favourite Star Wars moments of all time, across all types of media (you know which one I mean). My only gripes were with some of the directing and the fact that some of it looked really cheap, for instance the quarry encounter and the Imperial checkpoint scene, which were clearly shot somewhere in California. The logistics of that checkpoint made no sense, Vader letting Kenobi being dragged away from a fire which he could have just walked around made no sense, the little squad of stormtroopers made no sense and some of the backgrounds and CGI were a bit off. In a stark contrast to the amazing production value of Andor, Kenobi seemed to rely too hard on the volume and its budget was stretched too thin. However, as mentioned above, there were also many things about it that I truly loved and that always excite me about getting to this show on each chronological re-watch of the saga that I do. If they were to iron out the problems that this first season had in a potential second season (either a higher budget with more real locations or a shorter season with better pacing, that makes more use of its budget, as well as fewer awkwardly directed moments like Leia\u2019s abduction by Flea) and if they come up with a story worth telling, I\u2019ll be all for it!\n\nThings that I could see them cover in a second season would include:\n\n- Obi-Wan training with Qui-Gon\u2019s force ghost and learning to become one with the force.\n\n- Obi-Wan having a chat with Yoda through the force.\n\n- Kenobi protecting Luke and the Lars homestead, as seen in the comics. Maybe even Luke experiencing an adventure or two with this crazy, old and mysterious wizard named Ben.\n\n- A live-action recreation of Obi-Wan\u2019s final confrontation with Maul from Rebels. Since we\u2019re seeing a live action Ezra in Ahsoka, this could easily serve as a thematic \u201ccrossover\u201d with that show and give us Obi-Wan\u2019s perspective of the excellent \u201cTwin Suns\u201d episode from Season 3 of Rebels. Bear in mind that many more casual fans don\u2019t watch the animated shows. They may have caught glimpses of Maul\u2019s return in TCW and they\u2019ve seen him in charge of Crimson Dawn in SOLO, but thus far, they have had no closure on the entire matter.\n\n- Reva\u2019s story needs to be continued. To make amends for her many sins as an inquisitor, I could see her become some sort of force-wielding samurai\u2019esque vigilante, who may even support and protect The Path in helping more Jedi or other persecuted force users into safety. A plot surrounding Reva and The Path could be what gets Obi-Wan off of Tatooine for another quick adventure and it could introduce us to other surviving Jedi, including Quinlan Vos, who had received a teasing shoutout in the first season. \n\n- I don\u2019t want Obi-Wan to have yet ANOTHER confrontation with Vader, though. Their duel in season 1 was the perfect \u201cpenultimate confrontation\u201d before their final rematch on the Death Star in ANH. However, I wouldn\u2019t mind Vader cameos here and there when he orders his inquisitors to go after The Path and the Jedi survivors. \n\n- The \u201cfinal battle\u201d could see the Jedi survivors (led by Obi-Wan and Reva) battle a group of inquisitors in order to buy the other refugees of The Path time to escape. The (former) Jedi realise that their purpose and destiny is not to destroy the Sith and restart the old Jedi Order, but instead to save the \u201cchildren of the force\u201d, who are among the refugees and the future generation who must bring balance back to the force. Sacrificing their own lives in order to preserve this future generation is a \u201cmuch more Jedi thing\u201d to do than simply wiping out one\u2019s enemy. Reva, as well as Quinlan and most of the surviving Jedi, sacrifice themselves for this greater good. Obi-Wan, however, is given an opportunity to escape by Reva in her final moments, as she knows that Kenobi is watching over the most important of all these \u201cchildren of the force\u201d back on Tatooine. Upon his return to that desert backwater, we\u2019d have the perfect moment for a much wiser Jedi Master, who has fully embraced his purpose and who is now at peace, to confront a vengeful and twisted Maul.",

He wouldn't ever get purposely involved in this as it puts his personal mission at too much risk.  Perhaps The Path starts running through Tatooine.  Obi senses this and knows that this many force sensitives running through Tatooine puts Luke at too great a risk.  Obi goes to plead with whoever is in charge of The Path on the planet and encounters Quinlan Vos with a fresh group of force sensitives who just arrived and have nowhere to go...someone may be following them\n\nObi realizes the only way to get Quinlan to move his Path outpost (and this protect Luke) and save this group of force sensitives from certain death is to lead them to safety himself, perhaps to a place he knows they will be safe forever.

    "postText": "With Jedi scattered throughout the whole galaxy and many very powerful, I don\u2019t think it is at all far fetched that even just 1% of them survived. That is 100 Jedi!\n\nWe have yet to even see half of that in canon and people already seem to think it\u2019s improbable more keep popping up. It makes sense, some of them more than likely were not even with clones at the time or were just very powerful force users. \n\nAs far as them constantly making their way into the story lines in shows. These surviving Jedi would be some of the most powerful people left in the universe after the purge. If the shows are highlighting the most influential people after order 66 it makes sense the surviving Jedi would eventually cross paths with them. \n\nTo add I think it\u2019s cool we get to see them in many forms. It seems accurate that they would follow different paths. Some hiding, others falling to the dark side as inquisitors, becoming mercenaries, or trying to protect the galaxy from the empire. \n\nI got the numbers info from wookiepedia, but that\u2019s just my thoughts with that information",

Which pretty much takes it too literally,  were any Jedi survivors are not organized in any meaningful way to the Empire's goals. \n\nBut, I imagine its more of a tired trope, now, especially repeated in Rebels, Mandalorian,  Obi-Wan and others.",

It doesn't necessarily indicate that it took him 20 years.\n\nThe reason I don't buy it is because in A New Hope, the jedi are a nearly forgotten legend. In addition to Tarkin, there's Motti calling it a sad devotion to an ancient religion, Luke doesn't know anything about jedi or the force, Han thinks it's all superstition. \n\nIf it was one comment, then fine. But episode 4 went a long way to convince us that the jedi are gone. Now we find out that basically everyone in the Alliance has probably met a jedi in the last 5 years. I don't buy it.",

Based on what I read about his birth year vs when the Clone Wars was, Han Solo woulda been around 10 yrs old (please correct if I am wrong). Considering Anakin was like 9 when he first met a Jedi, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Han didn\u2019t at his age. And to kids Jedi were possibly tales, fables, stories that made kids question if they were real.\n\nHowever this article (below) seems to cover this topic pretty well. And pretty much puts me in the mindset that maybe Han could have seen Jedi but by that point in his life he never saw anything good about the Jedi so it\u2019s easier to dismiss their existence? \n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-knights-forgotten-mandalorian-clone-wars",

Many stayed in the temples almost permanently and the ones that did venture out usually only met with leaders of planets and senators. In a galaxy of trillions it's extremely unlikely that the average person would ever meet a Jedi. Heck I'm willing to bet even during the pre clone wars days there were plenty of people who thought the Jedi were myths or Republic propaganda. Mix that with a huge propaganda scheme by Palp to both blame and make people forget about the Jedi and you've got atleast one generation that would know nothing about them. Aside from some backroom whispers the Jedi would have been forgotten just as Palp intended. \n\nWith the rebellion you notice they're the first people aside from Obi Wan to use \"may the force be with you\" which is generally a Jedi line. This makes sense as the rebellion would be a very Pro Jedi group. Probably partially because a founder of the Rebellion was a Jedi even though she kept herself in the shadows for the entirety of her involvement. Also atleast two other Jedi that we know of served in the rebellion. \n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is smaller numbers in a huge galaxy, plus disconnect from the general public, most of their number being wiped out 20 years prior to episode 4 with most of those remaining being picked off over the next few years, plus a huge taboo/ propaganda from the Empire. It really isn't that hard to see why they're generally considered myths outside those that knew them personally.",

I doubt there's any lore mystery around those details.",

Obi-Wan and Yoda obviously survive. Who else is around by ANH? Grogu? Would have been a Youngling and not really relevant to the Jedi. \n\nGungi is probably dead since he went off to Kashyyyk. \n\nSo at the time of A New Hope, it's pretty likely that Obi-Wan, Yoda and Ahsoka were the only Jedi that survived through to that point.

The problem for believing they could all have been killed is the wide variation between what the Jedi could do as seen in different mediums, and sometimes within the same shows. Jedi who could pick up cars with the force and throw them into groups of people, or blast people off roads or blow doors off hinges, not to mention the whole light sword thing where you know where the blaster bolts are going to come and simply redirect them back at whoever fired, well, it makes it pretty damned hard to kill a Jedi.  On the other hand, the ones in the flashbacks of the temple went down pretty quickly to a handful of clone troopers.",

Palpatine set up an emergency beacon using Jedi encryption telling them to return to the temple on Coruscant (that's why Obi-Wan and Yoda went to the temple after Order 66). Any Jedi who fell for it would be dead. And any Jedi who survived Order 66 and didn't go to the temple would be hunted by Vader, the Inquisitors, and the Empire. And hiding from a galaxy-spanning dictatorship is not easy. They have spies everywhere, regular people will turn you in to avoid the Empire's wrath, and Vader and the Inquisitors can literally sense your presence. Plus, Palpatine knew where nearly every Jedi was when he activated Order 66. Add to that the fact that most Jedi would try fighting rather than hiding, which would let the Empire know where they were, and it's pretty unlikely that a significant number of Jedi would survive the two decades before A New Hope. \n\nAlso, keep in mind, Jedi like Obi-Wan, Anakin, Ashoka, etc. are major outliers. The vast majority of Jedi would be taken down pretty quickly by the clones. See how effectively they took down Pong Krell, for example.",

To me it reads the unfortunate side effect of:\n\n reviving/\"surviving\" an existing character is \"safe\" in that it avoids the hazard of \"the entire entrenched community hates your new character because it inevitably falls short of their vision of the exact scope of the star wars universe they developed in their formative years\" or what I like to call \"Asoka syndrome\". \n\nTo be fair, some totally new characters survive and thrive, but it is definitely a gamble, and gambling with cash cows isn't something Disney likes much. \n\nIf you want to take it even further, introducing new varieties of force users, new/different social or philosophical approaches to the universe, etc then you play the same game but with even higher stakes. \n\nIronically, it is the very fandom itself whose ideological inertial is keeping the cannon in the very cameo/rehash of plot and players that they claim to detest. Because truely new is held to such a oppressive scrutiny.\n\nInterestingly:  Filoni started out bucking this trend, hell he even designed Asoka on purpose to play the Asoka Syndrome against itself. But as his works transitioned from \"filler kid cartoons shows\" running on back burners to him falling under the full and direct Eye of Disney's gaze, you can see the dulling and middling and rounding off happen in real time.",

To them, anything to the contrary becomes a retcon, because Tarkin and Yoda being unreliable narrators is not considered. \n\nThis is a funny thing in the Star Wars fandom that you can see extend elsewhere too. When Prime Minister Almec said Jango Fett wasn\u2019t a Mandalorian, he said this as a secret member of Death Watch, within the pacifistic Mandalorian government, publicly distancing himself from association with a violent, rogue Mandalorian. That didn\u2019t matter, though. A character said Jango Fett isn\u2019t a Mandalorian, so to the fans, he suddenly wasn\u2019t a Mandalorian, and this has led to years of arguments and video essays about how he his or isn\u2019t a Mandalorian and how this was it wasn\u2019t retconned. Almec being the most untrustworthy source of this information possible didn\u2019t matter; he is a Star Wars character, and he said something.\n\nAnother funny one is one book back in the Legends EU where Han lamented that Leia was too busy helping out the Whoevers on Planet Whatsit. (I\u2019m remembering those names wrong.) Wookieepedia users have been fighting ever since on whether the page for that planet should exist or not, because while it was clearly Han being sarcastic and flippant, many fans take this to mean he was legitimately talking about a planet and a species with those names. A Star Wars character said something, therefore\u2014according to many fans\u2014it must be 100% true and anything to the contrary is a retcon.\n\nI could keep listing more examples of fans taking in-universe words of characters too literally all day. In this case, the fact that some people have said in-universe that the Jedi are all gone makes some fans really confused to learn they\u2019re not all gone. It makes them feel like something is wrong. What it really is, is some people survived the Purge, and some characters may believe they are all dead. Others may technically consider those survivors to be former Jedi, but Jedi no longer, what with the fall of their order and their choices to remain hidden rather than live their lives as Jedi. I personally feel like this is Yoda\u2019s take. Even if there are other survivors out there, the nature of the galaxy means they cannot function as Jedi anymore, and therefore there are no more Jedi. Luke was training to be an active Jedi, making him ostensibly the only one in the galaxy.",

For those who've never heard them, these radio plays adapted the original trilogy and expanded on their story significantly at points.  They're also the only non-movie Star Wars media that Lucas explicitly declared to be 100% canon (I realize that doesn't mean anything now in the Disney age, but it does demonstrate how closely connected it was to the original material).  Worth tracking down and listening to them if you can find them.\n\nBack then, at least, it seems the status quo was that there were at least a handful Jedi survivors out there on the run, they were just doing their thing covertly and secretively, living in shadows and staying on the move.  They weren't *organized* any more, is the point; they weren't an *order.*  They were just hermits and wanderers like Ben.  Which fits really well with the idea that Jedi are thought of as relics by Imperial society.  Honestly I like this take a lot because it basically puts the Jedi in the same position the Sith had been in pre-Clone Wars.\n\n(Incidentally there are other fun little nuggets sprinkled through these radio plays.  Luke's quick training sessions with Ben aboard the Falcon while they're in transit to Alderaan, for example, have some neat extra dialogue where Luke describes the sensation of swinging a lightsaber; apparently they feel \"alive\" and almost have a mind of their own, it's difficult to get one swinging in the direction you want until you learn to work with it instead of fight it.)",

At the time those characters made those statements, Order 66 wasn't a thing. I don't know if Lucas himself had ever elaborated on how the Jedi were wiped out before the Prequel Trilogy showed Order 66. These statements can easily be interpreted multiple ways and supported by the statements and actions of the characters\n\nHowever, it doesn't bother me that a few more Jedi have survived because there's myriad reasons those characters statements can be incorrect. \n\nTarkin, for all his knowledge, didn't even believe Obi Wan was alive to begin with. If Obi Wan was alive, that opens the door for more Jedi to be alive. Tarkin was, by that point, essentially running the Empire and answered only to the Emperor himself. There's no reason to think Tarkin would've been informed of every possible Jedi survivor when....\n\nVader himself was tasked with hunting down the Jedi with the Inquisitorius. Any Jedi capable of evading Vader, the ISB, the Inquisitorius would've been hunkered down deep. Vader himself tells the Moffs \"the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force\". Obi Wan tells Luke \"The Force is what gives a Jedi his power\". If the Force is that strong, then it follows those who wield it would be considerably strong as well and capable of eluding the Empire. \n\nObi Wan telling Luke that Vader and the Empire destroyed the Jedi Knights doesn't eliminate the possibility of survivors just because his statement doesn't have to be literal. It was taken that way for decades after the original movie released but there's nothing stopping it  from just meaning the organization of Jedi Knights, not inherently every single Jedi\n\nYoda telling Luke that Luke was the last Jedi could've easily been a bit of motivational fibbing to push Luke to confront Vader. Just seconds later, Obi Wan gives Luke the little \"certain point of view\" spiel. It's entirely possible that Yoda, on his deathbed, is giving Luke a little push by making Luke think everything rides on Luke....which it largely does as Luke really was the only one who could've beaten Vader. Even Leia wasn't a great choice because she didn't have the training or insight Luke did",

Sure, they might have stayed hidden during the Empire, but how come they didn't reach out to Luke when he started rebuilding the Order?

I'm sure some weren't where they were supposed to be and hadn't reported their whereabouts, but that wouldn't be very many. He also set up an emergency beacon telling any surviving Jedi to return to the temple on Coruscant, where they'd be trapped and killed. And he had the Empire searching for any survivors. And he had Vader and the Inquisitors hunting them as well. And he and Vader and the Inquisitors can literally sense where they are. Plus, A New Hope is almost 20 years after Order 66. That's a lot of time for Palpatine to track down any survivors.",

            "comment": "I think it's a combination of factors. \n\nFirst, there's the OT that really makes it seem like the Jedi we see are essentially the only ones left.\n\nThen there's the prequel trilogy, that never does a great job showing the scope of the Jedi Order. The Jedi Temple is big, but it tends to not seem bustling or crowded. The stories we've seen don't show many Jedi who are just out there in the galaxy. The war appeared to take most of their manpower, so within  RotS, it feels like the vast majority of the jedi were either at the temple or stationed with clone troopers who turned on them.\n\nPersonally, I can reconcile all that and I don't hate that there are survivors. My issue is in how they're used. Too many seem to play similar roles. The broad strokes of Cal Kestis's backstory and role fighting the Empire are pretty similar to Kanan. Ezra Bridger as an apprentice learning the ways of the force while fighting the Empire is pretty Luke-like. Yet with all of these heroes, while they're treated as the central, special heroes of their respective stories, there's a ceiling for the amount of impact they have. Not only are they not incorporated into the story of the OT, they're not even mentioned. \n\nIt creates this dissonance where they're sort of retroactively meant to all be big deal characters, but they can't be *too* big a deal. Then they have to either be killed off before ANH or have a somewhat contrived reason as to why there were not more involved during the OT conflict. Ezra was carried off by magic hyperspace whales. Ahsoka was in the World Between World or who-knows-where. And I love Ahsoka, but it's a bit contrived.\n\nI'd like to see more variety in the paths for the surviving jedi. Not all of them have great destinies. Let's see a jedi who reconnects with a family member they haven't seen since infancy and has to come to terms with the relationship that never develops. Let's see a jedi who falls in love with someone and struggles with hiding their past and forming a kind of bond they never learned to within the order. Let's see a disillusioned jedi that becomes a bounty hunter or a professional podracer. Just give me some complex, varied people who don't end up fighting the good fight",

The constant reliance on using the post Order 66 to ROTJ era and mainly focusing on different Jedi really makes it feel like way too many have survived and in turn makes the universe feel smaller than it should. \n\nIt also doesn't help that we haven't really seen many Jedi who just fully quit being a Jedi post Order 66 they always either partially do and rejoin the fight eventually or never left the fight making a lot of post Order 66 Jedi stories feeling a bit too similar to one another.",

Whereas you'd expect the ones who continue to survive to be the ones who, like Yoda and Obi Wan (well, before the Kenobi show), keep an exceedingly low profile. The reason someone like Tarkin can say the Jedi are extinct doesn't have to be because the Jedi are actually extinct but because the only Jedi around might as well not exist, because they have to keep their head down to not get noticed.",

The force is the most iconic part of the entire franchise and it would be unrealistic to at least not mention it once in a show.",

You could argue that being able to sense a anakin\u2019s grief comes as much through their power in the force as much as it does their relationship with him. It\u2019s entirely possible that as far as yoda and kenobi know, they are the last Jedi, either jedi in the literal sense of the word, or for as far as they know they are the only survivors.\n\nAlso a number of stories, if not all, of surviving jedi have come from the time between episode 3 and 4, it is also entirely possible, and we see it in a number of games, that it takes longer than the immediate instigation of order 66 for the Jedi to be killed. All through a number of series and content we see the empire hunting down jedi and killing them or converting them. It is also possible that by the OT, the majority of those that survived the initial massacre have been hunted down and killed or converted.\n\nFor example, in the Jedi games, we meet, I think 7 jedi who have survived, two were converted to inquisitors, one hid on dathomir, one is the main character, one is a rebel, one is in a convent, and one hid from the empire before being captured and joining the empire to save himself. At the end of the second game, Cal, the main character is the only one alive.",

There will always be small pockets that escape- the ones who went underground early or already were when the killing started, the ones who slipped through the cracks, the ones who collaborated and then dipped, etc. I was reading a book on the subject for undergrad and cannot for the life of me find the reference now, but I believe the figure for survival is right around 2%. I can totally believe that with 200 Jedi running around the galaxy, we\u2019d encounter a couple dozen fighting the Empire.",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s definitely possible there are more Jedi who have become farmers hiding in outer rim as well as the few warrior/mercenary types bouncing around concealing their powers when around people. I\u2019m such there were plenty of Jedi taking the Jedi sabbatical (I forget what that\u2019s called) or off researching stuff on their own.   The thing to remember though is that pretty much from day 1 of order 66 until we see him in A New Hope, Vader is just flying around the galaxy hunting Jedi. So say your example of 100 Jedi were actually still around. Of those that have not completely shut themselves off from the force and become farmers or whatever, you have Vader plus all his inquisitors roaming around killing them or converting them. That\u2019s a pretty long time for a super powerful killer with unlimited resources to be on the hunt. Comics show Vader encountering a number of them 1 of which basically wrecks Vader too! I imagine there\u2019s a lot of encounters like in the start of Kenobi where the inquisitor outs the not so strong Jedi at the cafe. You also have to imagine Jedi like that don\u2019t have much of a back story so you\u2019d need to build that for anyone you\u2019d actually care about since everyone we know from the movies are gone. \n\nI\u2019m all for finding more survivors and creating stories about them. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m enjoying the high republic books. New Jedi stories about some pretty interesting/powerful Jedi experiencing all kinds of stuff both force and non force based back when there were so many Jedi they just sent them out in packs and had their own fleet of ships!",

            "comment": "so my guess that its, at least to me, a perceptional and productional issue. the estimate of 10,000 is sort of an abstraction, in my opinion, in that we dont have a name and face for like 1% of them which would be like a hundred known jedis. the number they could've used for the total amount of jedis also could've been anything like 100,000 or 1,000,000. the fact is that its kinda arbitrary, at least as far as i can tell. all we have is the actual known jedi we get on screen. so when they give us something like order 66 and emphasize its effectiveness in such a way as to make it seem like no other jedis or former jedis are left alive except for yoda, obi-wan, and darth vader, we end up believing them. \n\nthats when it becomes a productional issue because later on you get ideas like kanan jarrus and former younglings like reva and grogu. you realize that you obviously couldnt have take all these future innovations into consideration so now all thats left is to just introduce them anyways as along as the ratio of jedis survivors to jedis terminated is still like &lt;1% i.e. less then hundred which still an effective extermination. but ultimately because that figure of 10,000 is just out-of-touch figure, any time you introduce yet another jedi who survived order 66 it will seem odd that luke only really ran into obi-wan and yoda in the ot, which ofc at that time survivors like kanan didnt yet exist.",

It\u2019s expressly stated in The Clone Wars that the numbers of the Jedi are dwindling as the Clone Wars drag on. \n\nSo, maybe 10,000 at the start of the Clone Wars. The First Battle of Geonosis saw many Jedi at the knight rank die. In the clone wars, we see Grievous kill a padawan, we see Tup\u2019s chip go bad and he kills one of the twins, we see Trandoshans kill a youngling, and are told more died before. We see multiple jedi of different ranks fall to the dark side. Hell, we see Savage gore a Jedi to death. We also see Ahsoka leave the order. \n\nBut also, Kenobi, Yoda, Jarrius, and Grogu survived the purge, as well as the Skywalker-Amadala twins. \n\nThere was not a genocide, at the 10k level. There was a war that caused their numbers to atrophy, and kept them from developing their ranks at the same rate. Then there was a targeted pogrom at Order 66. Then any Jedi who survived 66 laid low or was hunted down by the Inquisitors or Vader himself. \n\nThat said, we know of four active Jedi and three force sensitive humans who survived Order 66. There may be others who did what Luke did between the failure of his school and episode 8. There are almost certainly other force sensitive people who were missed, but give Palpatine his due. \n\nPS- if you think of Order 66 as a pogrom, you could compare it to the Clifford\u2019s Tower massacre, where everyone did die.",

Vader using movie (3\u00b3) feats, but maybe not Anakin. 5/10 Ren, not Rey though because she has goddess powers. \n\nThose are all duelers, though. The Emperor, I think bluffs spidey into trusting him once he bypasses his spidey senses. Probably have him turned to the darth side for a while until something cool happened, like Venom tearing Peter free of Palpatine's foul cognitive manipulations.",

His suit in insulated for electro, so force lightning shouldn\u2019t fry him bad, his senses give him a chance of no being swatted. Ultimately anyone writing the story would turn this into a classic spidey team up and have a Jedi swoop in and fill in the gaps of his shortcomings. Jedi teaches balance etc and spidey teaches quips. Story ends , spidey meditates, Jedi gets gets reprimanded by a uptight master for being hilarious",

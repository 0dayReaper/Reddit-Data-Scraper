My wife will FINALLY be watching all of the Star Wars movies with me before going to Galaxy\u2019s edge in 2 weeks. What order? She has trouble staying engaged. I\u2019m torn between 1-9 or rogue one first and then letting her decide if she wants to see what happened before or after?\n\nThoughts? TIA!",

So if getting her up to speed is your primary goal, you gotta check out at least TFA.\n\nI know this is controversial around here, but I think TFA is actually a pretty good starting point for new fans in general.  \n\nI have several family members who didn't give a shit about Star Wars until TFA came out.  \n\nFemale protagonist + modern sensibility did a lot of work toward getting my sister engaged.  Now she's almost as nerdy as I am.",

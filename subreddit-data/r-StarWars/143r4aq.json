Thanks to that legend it was a weapon that gave right to rule all the clans to its wielder but just the same the clans would only listen to the one who wields it. The weapon itself had no inherent power beyond that of any other lightsaber but Mandalorians believed the legend which gave it power.\n\nPersonally I think it's fine to leave it broken as a relic of a bygone era.",

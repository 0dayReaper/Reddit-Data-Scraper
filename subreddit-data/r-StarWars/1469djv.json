His character is just a cardboard cutout who looks exactly like every other video game protagonist from the late 2000\u2019s, and the story of how the Rebel Alliance was formed in canon is told much better by the likes of *Rebels* and *Andor*.",

They were very much of the time and as much as they walked so Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor could run, they're just OTT power fantasy and personally I would never want them to bring them to the small or big screen. \n\nI say we celebrate them for what they were, enjoy them with the forgiving rose tinted glasses of retrospect and leave them be.",

It\u2019s pointless bringing him back. Also, being realistic, Disney would have no interest in doing something like this. They\u2019re moving away from this era with the shows and the potential future films.",

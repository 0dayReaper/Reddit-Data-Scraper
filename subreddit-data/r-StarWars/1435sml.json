But what about yellow, orange, indigo, etc. Since these colors are canon, and we know the crystal picks the Jedi, tell us what each means. What does an orange lightsaber mean of the person it chose? I think it would be cool to see them do something like Harry Potter did as well with their wizarding world wand test. Let us see what color we would get.",

The only lightsaber colors we know the meaning of are red and white.\n\n&gt;\tSince these colors are canon, and we know the crystal picks the Jedi, tell us what each means. What does an orange lightsaber mean of the person it chose? \n\nYou're assuming that the crystals have any color tendency, but we don't have enough evidence to conclude this. Just look at Ahsoka's lightsabers. Before, they were green and suddenly they are blue in the finale.\n\n[This is Filoni\u2019s head-canon explanation](https://youtu.be/d_NmvaJyzj0) for the change: \n\n&gt;\t\"Anakin knows enough about lightsabers to be able to alter the angle or frequency of the saber blade or crystal to make it more like his own. As far as the story goes, I wanted to show a clear connection between the master and apprentice relationship of Anakin and Ahsoka, so I decided to shift her lightsabers to blue, like Anakin's.\n\n&gt;\tHim tinkering with her lightsabers while she is gone shows that he was always thinking of her, and the lightsabers are then a representation of her in the story and his thoughtfulness regarding her. His changing the color can also be seen as him exerting control or being too protective, which is very Anakin. He means well, but often takes things too far when trying to express how he feels.\n\n&gt;\tChanging the sabers, modifying them, improving them shows his care but also his ego, something that Ahsoka's familiar with. So the simple adjustment of the lightsaber color serves as many aspects of the relationship between the two characters.\"",

In the lore of Star Wars, it simply does not mesh with the ideology of the Jedi that they would pigeonhole its members into specific classes or encourage them to pursue different tracks. Even though every Jedi is a unique individual, all Jedi would be encouraged to strive towards the ideals of a guardian, a consular, a sentinel, etc. These concepts merely serve to limit characters\u2019 to certain archetypes based on the color of their saber rather than it simply being an aesthetic choice for the writers. \n\nTo your last point, it may not be canon but it\u2019s loosely based on info from the original films, not the other way around. Even before KOTOR was ever written there were very vague references to things such as the Mandalorian Wars (for example the original novelization of ESB referenced that Boba Fett war the armor of a people who warred with Jedi in years past). KOTOR merely expanded on these implications and developed them into actual stories and characters.",

The color would more or less be a representation of your inate preferences - Blue = Protection and Combat skill, Yellow = Technicality skilled and versitile, Green = Connection to the living force, Purple = Affinity for the dark used for the light.. but there could certainly be other descriptors as well. Its similar to your hogwarts house not effecting which courses you take or perfectly describing your personality. \n\nI didnt know about those eariler mentions to the mandalorian wars, im glad kotor went into depth with it as its definitely an interesting time period. To me its just sits oddly to have an MMO which I assume disney makes decent profits off of (being that 1 lightsaber skin can be $20) and is still having story added to yet is regarded as completely irrelevant to canon. So fans of that universe have to constantly be greeted with \"Well thats not canon\" from the real fans",

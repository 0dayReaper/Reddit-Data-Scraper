Making General Hux into a sneering, mustache twirling, Disney villain was so cringe it makes me turn it off. What they did to Rey and Finn's character arc was so uninspiring and a direct affront to Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth. Space horses on Star Destroyers? Snoke? .....You know what? I'm just going to stop right here because everyone knows, and has heard, the complaints thousands of times. \n\nI love that other people liked them though. At least some people got some enjoyment out of them. Star Wars is for everyone.",

No Luke had to be properly explained and so Rian did it in a way that made story sense. The problem is they cut his arc short and essentially made him a tragic hero. Rey was crazy powerful and that had to be explained. The world building? 7 really failed to establish anything that had happened post return of the Jedi. Even with the New Republic being essentially destroyed during the movie it was hard to even know what we were seeing and the implications of it",

Like I love star wars and have done since I was 5 but I have, I have owned the toys, games, t-shirts, posters, dvds, blu rays. But there are some things star wars I didn't like and that's OK. I can't stand the \"fans\" who tried to derail things because they didn't like one part of the whole thing. And still to this day say things like \"it doesn't exist\" etc.",

I think episode VIII is actually the best out of the 3. I think the way Luke is still a little weird but I dont completely hate it anymore also it has one of my favorite scenes with Luke and Yoda. The Holdo maneuver really doesn't bother me and it still looks really cool. The only part I still dont like is the Fin/Rose romance and side plot. Episode IX is probably the worst but I still think its enjoyable. First of it gave us Babu Frik. But other than that I really dont mind that palpatine returned, I just wish they actually built up to it. I also like the idea of Leia and Luke being the parents that Rey never really had and her adopting the name. My friend says it defeats the point of the message being that you your familly doesn't define what you are but I dont think that is the message. I think the message is more of that you can find your true family.",

Were people expecting Luke to exile himself and for him to be excited to join the resistance? I understand that this isn't the path that people wanted for Luke to go on after the ROTJ, but it makes sense to me. I love episode 7, but it really did not do well to set up episode 8.

TFA is a lot of fun and felt like the OT so it was a lot of fun, TLJ is a bit more experimental and emotional and is easily my favourite of the sequels and actually my 6th favourite SW movie. I love what they did with Luke, Kylo and Rey and the world-building with Canto-bight was cool (the sub-plot not so much). And then TROS was fun and the dyad stuff was really cool, Palpatine was great (though I didn't like that he returned I still found Ian Mcdermid's performance really chilling) and Luke coming back to talk to Rey and finish his arc full circle was great. I really like these films and despite the flaws they have (and the fact TROS is complete garbage) I still really enjoy them, they had a lot of potential that was used in certain places and not in others, could they have been better? Of course they could've their are so many things that could've been done better, so many things I would've done differently if I made them (not saying that I could do any better, all I am is a fan with a bunch of ideas but I'm nowhere near as good as any of the people working on films) but am I happy with what we got? Yes, yes I am, in fact I still come back and rewatch TFA and TLJ a lot.",

Last Jedi in particular is an amazing film\u2014up there with the originals.\n\nMy main issue is that the sequels kind of just broadly copy the OT's storyline. I think they are at their best when they do their own thing; the Force Dyad story is so cool, and luckily it's the heart of the trilogy.",

He was such a hopeful and inspiring person, and they changed him into someone who literally was going to murder his nephew in his sleep. That\u2019s crazy. The fact that that got signed off on and made its way into the movies is infuriating to me. Other than that yes they\u2019re entertaining, but they butchered what is arguably the main character of the entire franchise",

    "postText": "Is it just me or would it be amazing to finally see a wookie jedi in live action! Possibly Gungi since he somewhat established and would be a good age for this time period. Would even be a cool dynamic to see an old man Chewy as some kind of mentor to a young wookie. It could be a major or minor plot point with the last of the OT characters passing the torch to a new one.",

            "comment": "That's probably an unpopular opinion, but I really wouldn't want to see Wookies with too much screen time - after seeing a Wookie family growling at each other for half an hour in the Christmas Special (without subtitles!) I'm somewhat scarred by this experience. The issue here is that you can't incorporate them as regular characters without either having another character who constantly translates what they say, react to it in a way that explains what's going on or just put subtitles into the movie. Otherwise, this incomprehensible growling becomes annoying rather fast when they overuse it.\n\nI also have trouble imagining a Jedi - a diplomat, peace keeper and negotiator - who can't speak galactic basic to be able to take on most missions Jedi would be tasked with. I know there are Wookie Jedi in Canon and Legends but for me, this doesn't quite add up. Pretty much everyone who interacts with a Wookie  would be forced to learn Shyriiwook (Wookie language) - unless they come up with a Wookie who can speak basic, which probably is even more frightening...",

Some users had multiple crystals to change to a dual saber stance, while others used multiple crystals for different blade length options with just the staff configuration.",

On multiple occasions when the hilt was damaged one blade remained functional, then we have Ahsoka claim the crystals from an inquisitor blade to make her two sabers, then we have Cal Kestis... Basically yeah, usually it takes two. \n\nIn old canon it seems similar - Maul was described creating a batch of four synthetic crystals for his weapon, two for each blade. However at the same time diagrams of Exar Kun's lightsaber portray it having a single crystal chamber. So apparently exceptions do exist.",

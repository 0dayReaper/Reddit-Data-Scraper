We both struggled with depression and imposter syndrome, so Best's story was one we were personally invested in and we had no idea he'd be in the Mandalorian in a role with such potential and character. It was like a parasocial dream come true. Even my dad also felt similarly.\n\nYeah, a *lot* of fans were cheering.\n\nI think you",

I was so thrilled to see him in Mando.\n\nA lot of the SW fandom needs to touch grass.\n\nAlso: Jake Lloyd.  I thought he was a fine young Ani, I just thought (and still kinda do) that they should not have made the story about a 9 year old kid.  Anyway, I was at Philly Fan Expo this past weekend &amp; at Hayden Christensen\u2019s panel, he had the entire audience cheering for Jake in absentia.  Hayden seems like a pretty earnest, humble dude &amp; love that he\u2019s using his own fan redemption to lift up other cast members.  It was actually really touching.",

He knocked him to the ground with a surprise shot to the head, but Vader had Boba on the ground more than once without many people claiming Vader conclusively won. It would be a stretch to even say Boba held his own against Vader here.\"\n\nbut boba spared his life instead of killing vader.\n\na surprise shot doesn't matter because in many adaptations of this fight, he held his own against vader, even when boba was wielding a lightsaber, he has all the tools necessary to combat vader, so I can see why.",

Finally won and then during the following cut scene my game crashed and I had to do it all over again. Took me only a couple more attempts to beat him again but it sure was annoying. I am playing on a Xbox Series S. Aside from the occasional crash the game works fine for me.",

I don\u2019t rly like games were your story is already decided and when the game forces you to follow one path I like feeling like I\u2019m really alive in the world and I didn\u2019t get that feeling from this game",

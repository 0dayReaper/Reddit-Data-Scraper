    "postText": "I've always just written off anything star wars movies and shows without ever giving it a try. Well I'm now 30 and I've been thinking that maybe its time to jump in. I know the basic lore of it but i just feel now that i cant go my entire life without giving it a chance\ud83d\ude05. Where should I start?\n\n\nEdit: So it seems like the general consensus is that the films be watched in release order, but it also seems like some of you say that it makes more sense starting the prequels 1st. I think I'll go with release order and sprinkle in the animations and shows later on. Looks like this while take a while. I'll get back with y'all lol",

It\u2019s okay to not like something but it\u2019s totally not cool to make others feel like they shouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy it, which apparently some people in the fandom don\u2019t understand. Take your time and have fun with it!",

Maybe that's just my opinion because my first star wars movie was Revenge of the Sith when I was 8 and I was a little confused how it went from THAT to puppets but I was little. I think the most optimal way to watch it would be 1,2,3, Rogue One, 4,5,6, Solo (you can really throw this in anywhere after 123) then 7,8,9",

I'd watch them last if at all. \n\nI'd recommend the Original Trilogy (4,5,6), then the Prequels (1,2,3), then Clone Wars, Rebels, Bad Batch (or Bad Batch then Rebels, depending on how you feel about minor spoilers), after that Rogue One, followed by Solo, then the Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett (in release order, cause BoBF has some Mandalorian stuff in it.) After all that, if you really wanted to, maybe watch the Sequels and Resistance, but I'd recommend against it based on the quality compared to everything else.\n\nAnother great option is to watch everything in the chronological order recommended on Disney+, but same warning about the Sequels.",

You say you already know the  basic lore, but just to be on the safe side I\u2019ll say that there is an important piece of information revealed at the end of 5 that watching 1-2-3 would then give you context for before it gets tied in a bow in 6. It might be an interesting way to go.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve watch the main six, feel free to watch whatever else tickles your fancy. If you\u2019re curious about what happened during the Clone Wars, then there\u2019s an animated movie and seven seasons of an animated show about it. If you want a more adult, prestige drama then check out Andor. The sequel trilogy is worth watching if only to have an opinion about it.",

But also, between the two of them, you get to experience everything the Star Wars franchise has to offer. If you get done with those two movies, and just aren't feeling it, then you can safely assume Star Wars isn't for you, and move on with your life. But, if you finish those two movies and absolutely love it, then feel free to dive right into whatever else sounds interesting to you. With Rogue One and A New Hope, you'll have a very solid foundation of lore to build off, and everything else won't be too hard to figure out.",

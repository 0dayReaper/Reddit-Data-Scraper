Which is ridiculous- Han is a rogue. He's the reluctantly good character; jaded by experience. This shift to adding Greedo shooting first, then Han second changed how the viewer sees the character early on in the story. Growing up, I loved how this showed how Han doesn't take shit from anyone, and is used to a life of danger and survival. Kind of sad that Lucas, then Disney later (Mclunkey? WTF) kept messing with a perfectly good scene. \n\nI personally can't watch the special editions: too much added and changed. Since we can't pick and choose the special edition or original version footage scene by scene to make our own personal cuts (one can dream...), I'll take the original theatrical releases any day- which is what the laserdisc version is, afaik.",

They're a incredibly high quality re-de-master where basically someone took the original VHS, Laserdisc, and even film where available, and they restored the original theatrical release but upscaled to HD (maybe even 4k). For me it's the definitive way to experience the OT at least until there's some sort of official re-release of the theatrical release (which I highly doubt at this point). It's not available on YouTube or streaming unfortunately-you kind of have to dig around to find ways to either stream or download/torrent it but it's out there if you're willing to look a bit and it's awesome.  \n\nEdit: there are even newer better-er things than what I have promised and other people can tell you about them",

He's not a murderer though, so you can see the regret on his face when he leaves the bar. That's character building. He's painted as a \"bad guy\" with a good heart. Lucas was an idiot to change that.\n\nMy absolute fave Han Solo moment is when they see Vader in Bespin. They enter the room, Han sees Vader (the most fearsome person in the galaxy), Han literally quick draws and opens fire. Han doesn't look at Lando (for the betrayal), he doesn't panic, he doesn't duck or run. He just fucking goes straight after the most powerful sentient being he's ever heard of.\n\nOT Han Solo is ballin!",

They filmed it with the 'original' Jabba who was a human.  The alien Jabba is way better, but this scene...is just awful in context.\n\nJabba one of the biggest baddest crime lords around, lets a smuggler who owes him money step on him with zero consequences...riiiiight.  You're right Jabba would never have tolerated that.",

He is a smuggler and a criminal. It's clear he isn't a good guy. His story in episodes IV and V are him transforming from a criminal looking out for himself to a hero of the rebellion. I really don't know why Lucas felt like Han shooting first made him look like a bad guy when the context of most of the film already makes him out to be no hero to anyone but himself.",

Laserdisc looks okay on modern displays; but they were never designed to be used on anything larger than a 32\" 4:3 tv. If your blowing that image up larger than 100\" on a digital display it won't look great. Essentially, Laserdisc is just a large DVD with a softer image quality. If you really want the premium analog experience you will need an analog display, otherwise it's not really worth it to view a Laserdisc.\n\nThere are some guides online that go into some detail about using Laserdisc in the modern age, but fundamentally the image will always look about the same as a DVD.",

Can't beat built in bathroom breaks! \n\nSide note: he also has the star trek movies on laserdisc as well as Phil Collins Live in Berlin. Could be some others but those are what I remember.

Some very dedicated fans tracked down the best possible 35mm sources they could find, scanned them in 4K, and digitally restored the whole movie frame by frame. The opening crawl for ANH doesn't even say \"Episode IV\", that's how old and pure the sources are. It's honestly one of my favorite things in the world as a huge film nerd and SW fanatic.\n\nIt's absolutely stunning, like something the Criterion Collection might release. They have a version that's a straight restoration with the full glorious 70s film grain and one with Dynamic Noise Reduction\u2014their \"special edition\", if you will.\n\nThey also did 4K80 and 4K83 restorations. I won't link it because of the highly dubious legality of the whole thing, but searching for 4K77 oughta do the trick.",

But it's not like they threw away the old pieces they removed. They're just sitting in a different canister somewhere.

All the pieces to it still exist, you just have to put it back together. \n\nNot that LucasFilm even needs the *original* original negative reel.

I can't remember how it ended but it was funny",

Defenders of the change, or at least defenders of Lucas' mindset, always cite the idea that Han is shady, but not \"evil\", and that having him shoot Greedo without being shot at is too far in the unsavory character direction.\n\nBut Greedo has a gun pointed right at his head the whole time. In most situations I think the majority of people would agree with, or at least be understanding of shooting someone who is pointing a gun at you and threatening you. This is absolutely self defense.",

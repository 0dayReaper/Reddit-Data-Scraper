You should buy it with caution as it is quite a hassle to build and it's not as easy as building a normal lego set.",

I put them together and left them on a shelf to collect dust, when I moved I took them all apart and cleaned each piece with a soft toothbrush. Still have them bagged up to this day, no lost pieces!  Back then spending 40 dollars on a set was expensive. Now it seems you can\u2019t get anything worthwhile under $100.  I have the ultimate collectors edition millennium falcon and would love to have the star destroyer. Not sure about shelling out another $700 though.  Great collection!",

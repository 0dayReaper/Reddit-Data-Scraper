The villager says \"Oh man...now I have to go back to the village and get two more cows\"...\n\nAs the person finished this story another poster replied \"You should have just killed him and saved him the trip.\", followed by a third poster replying \"You sir are a true Dark Brotherhood acolyte.\"",

Cal is 23 at the start of Jedi Survivor, which means he was 18 during Jedi Fallen Order, 13 during Order 66, and *10* during the Battle of Geonosis, the Separatist Crisis, and the start of the Clone Wars, and he was born around the events of the Trade Crisis and the Battle of Naboo. The age that Jedi Initiates, that is, younglings, become Padawans is not entirely clear, but Initiate clans go to the age of 8, and in the Old Republic an initiate must become a Padawan by the age of 13. It\u2019s likely that Cal deployed in the earliest days of the Clone Wars, at 10 years old. Probably he didn\u2019t see much combat, but we know he saw some, at least, and that was likely true of many, many Padawans. Ahsoka isn\u2019t much older, she was 14 at the start of the Clone Wars. Horrifying.",

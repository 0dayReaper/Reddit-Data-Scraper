Seeing it on the internet is cool but for some reason as soon as I saw it I pictures these posters in the Star Wars museum thing at Epcot center which is already amazing but your artwork belongs there. It helped me see these posters as a way I hope they get used. \n\nCongrats! Keep doing art, I hope you get more things officially licensed by awesome companies.",

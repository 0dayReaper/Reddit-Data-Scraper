I personally wasn't very happy with where they went on that particular faction. Just felt wasted, like a lot of other sequel stuff",

I know and have read the kylo ren comic but I feel could do a good tv adaptation of his childhood being part of Lukes order and the gradual turn from Snoke. From there of course giving the knights of Ren the ability to be flushed out as characters so that welll. IDK how you fix their lack of anything in the movies but at least its better than nothing .",

I know we have the kind of cliffhanger in Solo, and we don't really know what went down for him between that point and his appearance in Rebels set a few years later, but it's not really worth investigating. It's not going to add a significant element to his character that we haven't seen already, and there's nothing wrong with a little bit of mystery being left to some characters.\n\nI'm not really interested in the Knights of Ren, although I do think they're definitely a missed opportunity. I would see more value in investigating their story further (even if it was a retcon from the story given in the Star Wars comics). But I can't see anything about them really undoing how criminally underused they were in the main films.",

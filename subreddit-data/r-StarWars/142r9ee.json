As the list grows longer, it lessens Vader's proficiency as the Sith Lord who \"helped the empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.\" Plus, it weakens Luke's heralding the return of the Jedi when 500 of them come out of the woods congratulating him.\n\nMy 2 cents",

So if it was actually more along the lines of 95% effective..... room for 500 Jedi. Scattered across the galaxy.\n\nAnd BECAUSE Order 66 didn't entirely wipe them out, they formed the Inquisitors to hunt down the survivors.\n\nAND there were force sensitive children still being born and trained after the fact like Ezra.\n\nKeep in mind George Lucas himself went out of the way to have Obi-Wan talk about altering the signal from the Jedi Temple warning survivors to stay away. He always left the door open for Order 66 survivors.",

They have the cool powers, and the cool laser swords, and they find their way into most major conflicts across the setting. You certainly can make stories in the setting that lack force users of any kind, but because the force is such a big part of what makes Star Wars a little different from other science fantasy stories, writers feel compelled to include them. Erasing the Jedi from the bulk of the setting feels kinda bad if you're looking to make something in the setting that doesn't rely on previously established characters. Sure, it can feel a little off to discover yet another Jedi who escaped the purge, but at the same time, ya kinda need it if you want to have your cool lighsaber duel featuring original characters and eat it too.",

Even with hyperspace travel, that\u2019s not a very big window to comb an entire galaxy for the maybe hundred Jedi who *could* have survived, hence needing the Inquisitors. \n\nObi-Wan was able to hide for 9 or 10 years before an Inquisitor appeared and they weren\u2019t even really looking for him, but another Jedi that happened to be in the same place. Yoda was never located by the Empire, as far as I know, so it\u2019s entirely plausible that there\u2019s plenty of Knights/Padawans out in the remaining hidden.",

He still spent a lot of time doing literally just that. And it's still Vader's turn that even allowed the Emperor, and by extension, the Empire to execute Order 66 and destroy the Jedi Order. \n\nAnd, as others have already said, it's still something like barely 1% of the Jedi that survived. Where this some other eradication we were looking at and it was \"only\" 99% effective, I doubt there'd be these criticisms. \n\nPlus, Lucas has said multiple times he would have had EVEN MORE Jedi around that survived Order 66 lmao",

For much the same reason that we don't read books about the many Hobbits who stayed home and led quiet lives, we read about the handful of ones who went off to have adventures involving dragons and magic rings.\n\nAnd even for the growing number of Jedi we learn about who made it through the purge, it had a *staggering* effect on their lives.  Cal, Kanan, and Obi-wan all faced massive struggles in just surviving in a galaxy that's now actively hostile to them.  Ahsoka (self-proclaimed not-a-Jedi, but its not like the Empire cares) had a somewhat easier time because Vader had very good reason to believe she was dead and so no one was looking for her, but she still had to be careful to fly under the radar (until she didn't and got nearly killed in a duel with Vader).  Yoda just hid and stopped interacting with anything resembling civilization.\n\nOf course some Jedi survived, and of course we tell stories about them.  More will come, I'm sure.  But the pervading themes of fear and loss that all of the surviving Jedi stories share mean that the purge was far from meaningless.",

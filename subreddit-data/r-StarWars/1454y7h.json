He was originally going to be a Zabrak, but writers made him human because they were worried he wouldn't be relatable. Even though Zabraks are basically human with some horns and face tattoos.\n\nMeanwhile non humans that don't even talk like R2 and Chewie are so beloved that when Leia didn't hug Chewie it was a minor scandal in the fandom. Authors need to be more willing to take a chance on non human characters. Hell one of most recent summer blockbusters had people in theaters crying over a cyborg racoon.",

The *Force Collector* novel had a half human half Mirialan character (also implied that the human protagonist had a crush on her). Kaz had a crush on another Mirialan character in *The Resistance*. The *Join the Resistance* books had a budding romance between a human and a Zeltron. One of Doctor Aphra's exes seen in her solo series is non-human.",

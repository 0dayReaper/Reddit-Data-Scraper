    "postText": "\tFirst of, the positive is the setting because at least for me i don't know much about the era between episode 5(ESB) and 6(ROTJ), also i like the addition of different activities and battles like vehicle combat. BUT, Come on ubi with those characters. why does it have to be like a kids movie with a little woman that's like rey (in character) and a little pet following you around?! They could have gone with so many cooler ideas like being a bounty hunter like the most loved game that never got released the star wars 1313 which was truly awesome being a bounty hunter and especially a mandalorian in corucant and all the big cities in the republic and prequels era. They could have gone with a powerful jedi for an outlaw or a badass gunslinger but they chose that Disney kid bullcrap. Additionally wtf is this ship she's piloting it looks like a box which shoots green piss out the front. Summering, it seems like I'm ranting and it might be but it really has a good idea and setting but they could have gone for better characters as well as theme. i just expected a lot more with such a treasure of an ip from ubisoft, I'm tired of it and thought to share it to see what other people think about the whole thing, so what did you expect or are you disappointed / excited about something in this?",

I like the stories, the voice acting is decent, with some really good names in there, but the travel is just. So. Slow! I think they should have had a single player \"setting\" that would be your own instance, and only spawn enemies for actual objectives, rather than the mobs scattered across the map.",

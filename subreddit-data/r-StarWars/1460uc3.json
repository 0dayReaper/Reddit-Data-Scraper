Technically pure release order puts R1 after 7 and Solo after 8 but that just feels odd to stop a trilogy twice to watch an unrelated story. \n\nOr in timeline order 1-9, with either Solo and Rogue One between 3 and 4 or after 9.\n\n\n&gt; for rewatches\n\nwhatever order you want.",

Form your own opinions. Have fun and let us know what you think!",

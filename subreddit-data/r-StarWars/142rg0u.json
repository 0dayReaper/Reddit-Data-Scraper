Is it more interesting letting it think it will escape, only to recapture it?\n\nPlot Armour aside, and ignoring Maul during TPM and Sidious during RotS, I've always felt that there was a huge element of \"cat\" in the Sith mindset.\n\nI think the biggest examples I can think of, off the top of my head are Dooku and the arena scene during AotC and Sidious during RotJ/RotS, where he loved using the lighting.",

    "postText": "I've been rewatching the Clone Wars for Ahsoka's series. I noticed, during the season 2 Mandalorian episodes, the ones with Satine and Obi-wan, Kalevala is mentioned multiple times.\n\nI honestly thought Kalevala was introduced in the Mandalorian season 3. It's cool to see aspects of the lore introduced in the cartoons, however subtle, be brought into live action like this.\n\nJust a cool little easter egg I found.",

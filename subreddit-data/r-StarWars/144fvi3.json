You can start almost anywhere. \n\nOne of the best parts about Star Wars is nearly every story has parts that invite you to experience more of it. Rarely is anything so self-contained that you wouldn\u2019t have any idea of where to go next.",

Not only on what order to dive in, but also what is worthy to watch or read.\n\nSo here\u2019s mine.\n\nWatch the original 6 films in release order. This is the Lucas Era and above all other things, it\u2019s what \u201cmatters.\u201d\n\n*Andor* and *Rogue One* slot in between Episodes 3 and 4 but I don\u2019t recommend watching them until you\u2019ve seen the movies.\n\nAfter that, start reading some books! *Heir to the Empire* has been the classic launch point into the Expanded Universe for decades, and for good reason. This book was widely hailed as Episode VII before Disney put out their own version.\n\nEdit: just saw a comment you made elsewhere. If reading isn\u2019t your thing, audiobooks exist for almost all of the books.",

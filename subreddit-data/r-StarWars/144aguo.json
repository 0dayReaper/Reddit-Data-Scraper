I figured if Vader trained them too much, they'd count as full blown apprentices as opposed to what they are now. My logic was they willing trained them to be at the lowwer level they are in order to test the Jedi's strenght. If they were weak, the iquisitors would ruin them, but if the Jedi was strong, then the iquisitor would be killed, but it would flush the jedi's location out.",

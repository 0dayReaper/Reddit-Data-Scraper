She works in one of the most storied houses of learning in the known universe.\n\nAnd yet somehow she's still got the most provincial way of thinking I've ever seen. She's like every old woman in every movie in the 1930s and 40s who lived in the wild west era and still dresses like she's riding a covered wagon to a homestead.\n\nAbsolutely can't let that go. I bet she has a toy made after her, too. I bet that woman has a WHOLE backstory some industrious person had to write out.",

When Order 66 went down the librarian, Jocasta Nu, detonated an explosive in the vault to ensure the weapons were destroyed and couldn\u2019t be used, but she held on to one.\n\nIt\u2019s a blaster that uses the lightsaber as a power device. Instead of standard plasma gas bolts this gun flings my kyber bolts.  It\u2019s incredibly impractical because the crystals energy is spent in just a few shots, reducing it to shattered pieces, but if you only need a few shots?\n\nShe tries to take down Vader with it. Puts up a pretty awesome fight actually.",

They became so arrogant in their ways, that they knew everything and nothing was beyond their sight that they let the galaxy burn under them, leading to the clone wars, the galactic empire then later the first order. He saw the jedi fail again and again and this librarian's attitude sums up the entire jedi ethos perfectly. I think this is also why episode 8 ends with the boy grabbing the broom with the force to underline that \"the jedi are dead...long live force users all over the galaxy!\"",

I clearly remember her saying \"democracy\" in the theater each time, and being surprised months later when I got it on home video and it had been changed. \n\nThey also changed the scene where she falls out of the transport in AOTC. In the theater you could see it was her stunt double pretty clearly. By the time it was on home video the scene was blocked entirely differently and the double wasn't noticeable. \n\nThen of course, all the scenes of Yoda puppet were changed in later versions on home video into a CGI character to match the other two movies (a very good change). \n\nIt **was** democracy. I quoted it on the original Jedi Council Forums a few times before the home video release, back when they were a thing. I also recall discussing it on AICN at the time.",

The names of the Nemoidians and Kaminoans are enough to show that. Nute Gunray = Newt Gingrich, for example. Also, the quote used in the post was directly referencing Lucas's thoughts on Bush's handling of the wars in the middle east. At least as far as I can remember, I'm willing to be wrong on that. So yes, it does work nicely as a lens to look at all times and all societies, you're totally right. And we should use it that way. But it's also important to understand the original intent and context of these critiques, which is the events in American politics that happened in the early 2000s. We can both be right, and I think we are!",

Both the Republicans and the Democrats pushed for the war, while US media (both left and right leaning) acted like pure propaganda channels with no shred of journalistic integrity, and leading up to the start of the invasion the US public had been stoked into a raving mob that were basically frothing at their mouths demanding blood. \n\nThis despite the rest of the world telling the US no and trying to explain that Iraq had jack shit with to do with 9/11 and that the evidence they had produced for WMDs so far was pretty pathetic...",

The Clone Wars has a lot of similar dialogue and I think it's clear that a lot of fans prefer their Star Wars a bit more blunt. I think that's totally cool, too. It's not my style but it doesn't have to be. \n\nFor me though, this line just isn't very clever. There's a room full of people applauding and Padme just reiterates that. The line isn't telling us anything other than exactly what we're seeing on screen, which doesn't need any explanation. It's like 90% of Ric Olie's dialogue in TPM. We see a shot of the ship approaching Tatooine and the next shot is Ric saying \"were approaching Tatooine\". We get a shot of the shields coming online and the next is Ric there to say \"the shields are back online!\".",

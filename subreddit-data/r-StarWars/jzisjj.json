They changed up the order and thus destroyed the motive. \n\nThe show had Jon get murdered solely because hE LeT WiLdLiNgS thRu dA WaLl\n\nIn the books, this was controversial but mostly all of the nights Watch understood the necessity of it.  They weren\u2019t stupid.  They know the dead come back to fight as zombies.  Jon lets the wildlings pass the gate with little resistance from his peers. \n\nNo, in the books, the reason for the mutiny is that Jon gets a letter from Ramsay Bolton that he had taken Winterfell, beaten Stannis, and has Arya hostage.  This pisses Jon off.  Jon begins forming plans for the Nights Watch to go south and fight to reclaim winterfell.  This is a direct breaking of his oath to take no part of the politics of the 7 kingdoms.  It is breaking rank with millennia of tradition.  \n\nHis brothers have to stab him to uphold their oaths and they do it with *tears in their eyes.*. That part stuck with me when reading it.  It\u2019s some of his closest friends who are destroyed internally over what they must do.  They are crying as they have no choice but to kill Jon just like Julius Caesar.  \n\nBut no, fuck all that. The show decided that\u2019s too complex and too nuanced.  Too sensible.  Let\u2019s just make it so that everybody is a simpleton who can\u2019t comprehend why Jon let the wildlings through the wall (DESPITE HAVING SEEN THE ARMY OF THE DEAD FIRSTHAND) and they kill him for this one dimensional reason.  Then Jon comes back and hangs them and is now clear to lead a nights Watch army south.  Yeah that\u2019s fucking cool.  Real great.  Goddamn now I\u2019m pissed again.",

But it does show a glaringly obvious disenchantment with the show on the backend, where simple, amateur mistakes are allowed to happen on a series with effectively whatever budget they wanted.\n\nAnd it wasn't just one cup. There were way too many gaffs like that making it to the *final version,* I cannot stress this enough. They had people pouring over those episodes before they were released and no one noticed. (or they had very little oversight at the end, which would prove that they were being negligent and didn't care)",

When the planet was threatened by the war-like Dire Wraiths\u2014another technologically advanced race capable of Skrull-like shapeshifting\u2014Galador's ruler, the Prime Director, called for volunteers to be transformed into cyborg warriors called \"Spaceknights.\" Volunteers were promised that their \"humanity\" (the body parts removed to accommodate the armor) would be preserved and restored to them after the danger was over. \nRom was the first to volunteer, and was transformed into a large, silver humanoid that at first glance appeared to be totally robotic. Rom was given Galador's greatest weapon, the Neutralizer, which on one setting could banish the Wraiths into the Limbo dimension forever. Inspired by his example, other Galadorians volunteered and eventually one thousand were transformed into Spaceknights - each with his or her own unique armor, powers and code names. The Spaceknights succeeded in stopping the Dire Wraith invasion, although Rom decided to follow the remnants of the fleet back to their home planet, Wraithworld (which orbited a black sun). The Dire Wraiths panicked, and after a futile counter-attack abandoned the planet and scattered throughout space. Unable to stop Rom, the Dire Wraiths successfully used their sorcery to trick him into allowing their escape. Rom now felt responsible for spreading the Dire Wraiths' evil across the universe, and swore he would not reclaim his humanity until all Dire Wraiths had been vanquished. Fellow Spaceknights, including comrades Starshine and Terminator, adopted the same oath and left Galador.\nAfter 200 years in space, Rom arrived on Earth, landing near the fictional town of Clairton, in West Virginia, United States. Rom befriended a local woman named Brandy Clark, who after witnessing Rom deal with the Dire Wraiths began to assist him in his mission. Those witnessing Rom's neutralizer could not see the Wraiths being banished to Limbo, leading Rom to be hunted for killing innocents. \nDuring his time on Earth, Rom fought and banished thousands of Dire Wraiths. The increasingly desperate Dire Wraiths created new foes for Rom, including Firefall, a fusion of human and Spaceknight; the sorcerous Hellhounds; and robotic Watchwraiths. Two of Rom's greatest foes were Hybrid (the result of a union between Wraith and human), and Mentus (a suit of Spaceknight armor occupied by the dark side of the Prime Director's psyche). Other opponents were more traditional and hailed from the Marvel Universe proper, such as the Mad Thinker, the Space Phantom, and Galactus and his then-herald Terrax. He encountered such heroes as the X-Men, Power Man and Iron Fist, the Fantastic Four, Nova, the Thing, and the Hulk. Rom was one of the many heroes transported into an arena in space for the Contest of Champions, though he was not chosen to participate.\nAt one stage a new breed of Dire Wraith arrived on Earth, and appeared to be far deadlier than the first variety. It was later revealed that these were females who relied on sorcery, as opposed to the weaker males who placed their faith in science. Unlike the males, the female Dire Wraiths chose not to act in secrecy and openly attacked Clairton while Rom was away, killing everyone (including Steve and superhero ally the Torpedo) with the exception of Brandy. Furthermore, they attacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mobile headquarters which gave Earth authorities clear evidence of the Dire Wraiths' existence and threat. So informed, the combined nations of the world pooled their resources to counter the threat, with Rom as their resident expert and leader of field operations. The Dire Wraiths came into conflict with the Avengers and the X-Men as well. Rom managed to banish all Dire Wraiths on Earth to Limbo with the aid of his super-powered allies and members of the U.S. military.\nRom left Earth soon after the battle and returned to Galador. Unknown to Rom, Brandy had accidentally met the entity called the Beyonder, and Brandy asked to be transported to Galador. The Beyonder complied and Brandy found herself on Galador, now a war-torn world occupied by a new generation of Spaceknights. Created to defend Galador in the absence of the first Spaceknights, this next generation of cyborgs became corrupted by their power, massacred the Galadorians in a show of superiority. In an act of spite, the new Spaceknights destroyed the frozen remains of the originals. Rom arrived too late and could only save Brandy. Enraged, Rom summoned the original Spaceknights and together they destroyed the traitors. Rom then made a surprising discovery - his original humanity persisted within the entombed body of Terminator. Reclaiming it, Rom became human again and finally admitted his love for Brandy. The two chose to remain on Galador, with the intent of repopulating the planet. The remaining Spaceknights, their humanity now lost, set out to explore the universe, except for a few others that remained on Galador to protect Rom and Brandy.\nDuring Rick Jones's wedding to Marlo Chandler, the human Rom returned to Earth, together with Brandy, as guests at the ceremony, and Rom greeted the Hulk with a friendly handshake.\nIn the Spaceknights miniseries (Oct. 2000 \u2013 Feb. 2001), written by Jim Starlin, it is revealed that Rom took the name Artour (a reference to Brandy's love of Arthurian legends, and perhaps in memory of his own encounter with King Arthur's ghost) and that he and Brandy had two sons. Rom himself is not actually seen in the series, nor is he mentioned by that name or shown in his spaceknight form (possibly to skirt the fact that Marvel no longer held the license from Parker Brothers, which had retained the copyrights on Rom's name and armored likeness); his ship is attacked off-panel just prior to the start of the story, with Rom himself missing and presumed dead.",

                    "comment": "I transcribed the scene here from a Youtube clip, since not everyone has seen this masterpiece of a movie:\n\n\n---\n\nDante: \"Empire\" had the better ending! I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen, gets taken away by Boba Fett, it ends on such a *down* note. I mean, that's what life is, a series of down endings. All \"Jedi\" had was a bunch of Muppets.\n\nRandal: There was something else going on in \"Jedi,\" I never noticed it til today. They build another Death Star, right?\n\nD: Yeah.\n\nR: The first one was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.\n\nD: Luke blew it up, give credit where credit's due.\n\nR: The second one was still being built when they blew it up.\n\nD: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.\n\nR: Something just never sat right with me that second time around. I could never put my finger on it, but something just *wasn't* right.\n\nD: And you figured it out.\n\nR: The first Death Star was manned by the Imperial Army. The only people on board were Stormtroopers, dignitaries; Imperials.\n\nD: Basically.\n\nR: So when they blew it up? No problem, evil's punished.\n\nD: And the second time around?\n\nR: The *second* time around, it wasn't even done being built yet! It was still under construction.\n\nD: So?\n\nR: So a construction job of that magnitude would require a hell of a lot more manpower than the Imperial Army had to offer. I'll bet they brought independent contractors in on that thing. Plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers-\n\nD: Not just Imperials, is that what you're getting at?\n\nR: *Exactly.* In order to get it built quickly and quietly, they'd hire anybody that can do the job. You think the average Stormtrooper knows how to install a toilet main? Alls they know is killing and white uniforms.\n\nD: Alright, so they bring in independent contractors. Why are you so upset about its destruction?\n\nR: All those innocent contractors brought in to do the job were killed! Casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. Alright look, you're a roofer. Some juicy government contract comes your way. You got a wife and kids, a two-story in suburbia. This is a *government* contract, which means all sorts of benefits. Along come these left-wing militants who blast everything within a three-mile radius with their lasers. You didn't ask for that! You have no personal politics, you're just trying to scrape out a living.\n\nCustomer: Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but uh, what are you talking about?\n\nR: The ending of \"Return of the Jedi.\"\n\nD: My friend here's trying to convince me that any independent contractors who were working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the Rebels.\n\nC: Well I'm a contractor myself, I'm a roofer. Done-And-Ready Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can tell you that your roofer's personal politics come into play heavily when choosing jobs.\n\nR: Like when?\n\nC: Three weeks ago, I was offered a job up in the Hills, beautiful house, *tons* of property, a simple re-shingling job! He told me if I can finish it in one day, he'd *double* my price. Then I realized whose house it was.\n\nD: Whose house was it?\n\nC: Dominic Bambino's.\n\nR: Baby-Face Bambino's? The gangster?\n\nC: The same! The money was right, but the risk was too high. I knew who he was, and based on that, I turned the job over to a friend of mine.\n\nD: Based on personal politics.\n\nC: Right! And the next week, the Foressi family put a hit on Baby-Face's house! My friend was shot and killed, and didn't even finish re-shingling!\n\nR: No way.\n\nC: I'm alive because I knew the risk involved in that particular client...my friend wasn't so lucky. Any contractors working on that Death Star knew the risk involved. If they got killed, it's their own fault! A roofer listens to this [points at his chest], not his wallet.",

It's worth noting though the prequels and such made it pretty apparent that *a lot* of the galaxy had an idea, even if a vague one, of the politics and wars going on by the time the events of *Jedi* took place. People might not have known exactly that the Empire was evil, but a lot of planets had bad interactions with them by that point. Plus, I can't imagine if you're working on Death Star 2 you miss the news that someone blew up Death Star 1.\n\nI think these concepts just further cement that any contractors working on the second Death Star knew the risks and potential damage. Heck, they also likely knew, thanks to the destruction of Alderan, exactly what they were building. Unless they were forced slave labor (which is very possible), I don't have much sympathy for anyone working on the second Death Star.",

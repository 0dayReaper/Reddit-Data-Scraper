The comic I believe is called Star Wars tales and is a compilation of different star wars comics ranging from funny cartoon to serious.  The plot for that specific comic was who was going to take Palpatines side, Vader or Maul.  After Vader kills Maul, Palpatine comes out and kills the priests that raised Maul from the dead.  Vader asks Palpatine if he knew about this to which Palpatine replies \"of course not...hehehe.\"  \n\nOne of my other favorite short stories is a comic of an older ex storm trooper talking about the glory days of the empire and someone calling him out by asking how can imperial storm troopers get beaten by a bunch of ewoks.  The ex storm trooper then explains how diabolical and fucking evil the ewoks were and how they were hunted down by them during the Battle of Endor.  Great stuff.",

The og actors kinda felt like drawn out cameos (little insensitive I know). Ford was ok. Maybe it was just too much. So much plot, trying to make new chars, old chars, paying homage to the original but trying to be its own thing? Not enough time to attach. Dialog maybe didn't help? Felt a little too predictable. Also, there was a slight problem of the ratio of epic optics over epic substance. Or maybe so much epic optics it normalized it.\n\nProbably just an old fuck though.",

But hey, someone else did it! I didn't see that coming!\n\nTo be fair, I actually really liked that scene. Kylo Ren is probably the best character overall from the new trilogy and that was a beautiful moment showing his continued inner struggle, plus a hint that he's still not as far gone to the dark side as he might like to believe. But then someone else still fires at the cockpit, rendering his own mercy meaningless in practice but not in spirit, and it could've been an interesting moment to build upon further with his character.\n\n&gt; Oh, Leia got sucked into the void of space? Bazinga! She force floats herself back into the ship!\n\nThis, on the other hand, I wasn't too fond of. Not only does it kinda screw over the previous scene, but it also looked way too goofy to have the kind of emotional impact that was intended. I get they wanted a dramatic moment to reveal Leia's force powers, but this wasn't it imo.",

And they just threw him away. They threw it all away. If it had just been a cohesive story that was well written (which yeah I guess isn\u2019t easy, but they theoretically should have had the greatest minds on this project)... it would be so much easier to forgive anything else that wasn\u2019t quite up to par. Not that JJ looked like he was creating an amazing trilogy, but whoever decided to let Rian take film 2 *and* let him do whatever the fuck he wanted is the real back breaker here. It was honestly the most disrespectful thing I\u2019ve ever seen done in the film world. He took JJs story and characters and gave him a fucking massive middle finger THROUGH the medium of a Star Wars movie. Fuck that noise. Watching that third movie it felt kinda good watching JJ throwing some of it back in Rian\u2019s face (like writing off Finn\u2019s \u201clove interest\u201d) - but that\u2019s the moment I realized that the trilogy was hot garbage. Star Wars should not be about getting on watching a pissing match between two directors disrespecting each other\u2019s work.",

You're right that it wasn't the greater good, but it was still a good intention to try to keep Padme and his unborn child from dying.\n\nIt's just that the way he went about it was completely fucked up. Sidious convinced him that in order to become strong enough in the dark side to save people from death, he would have to kill a bunch of Jedi, including all the younglings of the temple.\n\nAnd as for Anakin choking Padme, he was heavily immered in the dark side at that point.

Lucifer being the devil is the part that's more far-fetched, as in it's not literally in the Bible, as far as I'm aware, it's just that both are described as being cast down to earth.\n\nThe more recent popularizations, including the show Lucifer and Lucifer in Supernatural, are reasonably accurate in their background for the characters.",

He's even lost his own body, having become more machine than man, literally a husk of his former self.\n\nAll he has left is Palpatine, and the Empire that **has** brought peace to the galaxy.  So he continues down the dark path.  He encounters Ahsoka and Obi-wan, his two closest friends, and they both (understandably) denounce him as a monster out of hand.\n\nAnd so when his son, not even having known him in his better days, believes that he can be redeemed, it gives him the push he needs to believe in **himself** again.  He lets go of his hatred for himself in his final moments, and all it took was one person's belief in his redemption.",

                    "comment": "&gt;This is Anakin Skywalker:\n&gt;\n&gt; The most powerful Jedi of his generation. Perhaps of any generation. The fastest. The strongest. An unbeatable pilot. An unstoppable warrior. On the ground, in the air or sea or space, there is no one even close. He has not just power, not just skill, but dash: that rare, invaluable combination of boldness and grace.\n&gt; \n&gt; He is the best there is at what he does. The best there has ever been. And he knows it.\n&gt; \n&gt; HoloNet features call him the Hero With No Fear. And why not? What should he be afraid of?\n&gt; \n&gt; Except\u2014\n&gt; \n&gt; Fear lives inside him anyway, chewing away the firewalls around his heart.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anakin sometimes thinks of the dread that eats at his heart as a dragon. Children on Tatooine tell each other of the dragons that live inside the suns; smaller cousins of the sun-dragons are supposed to live inside the fusion furnaces that power everything from starships to Podracers.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Anakin\u2019s fear is another kind of dragon. A cold kind. A dead kind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not nearly dead enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not long after he became Obi-Wan\u2019s Padawan, all those years ago, a minor mission had brought them to a dead system: one so immeasurably old that its star had long ago turned to a frigid dwarf of hypercompacted trace metals, hovering a quantum fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Anakin couldn\u2019t even remember what the mission might have been, but he\u2019d never forgotten that dead star.\n&gt; \n&gt; It had scared him.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201c*Stars* can *die*\u2014?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt is the way of the universe, which is another manner of saying that it is the will of the Force,\u201d Obi-Wan had told him. \u201cEverything dies. In time, even stars burn out. This is why Jedi form no attachments: all things pass. To hold on to something\u2014or someone\u2014beyond its time is to set your selfish desires against the Force. That is a path of misery, Anakin; the Jedi do not walk it.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the kind of fear that lives inside Anakin Skywalker: the dragon of that dead star. It is an ancient, cold dead voice within his heart that whispers *all things die\u00a0\u2026*\n&gt; \n&gt; In bright day he can\u2019t hear it; battle, a mission, even a report before the Jedi Council, can make him forget it\u2019s even there. But at night\u2014\n&gt; \n&gt; At night, the walls he has built sometimes start to frost over. Sometimes they start to crack.\n&gt; \n&gt; At night, the dead-star dragon sometimes sneaks through the cracks and crawls up into his brain and chews at the inside of his skull. The dragon whispers of what Anakin has lost. And what he will lose.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dragon reminds him, every night, of how he held his dying mother in his arms, of how she had spent her last strength to say *I knew you would come for me, Anakin\u00a0\u2026*\n&gt; \n&gt; The dragon reminds him, every night, that someday he will lose Obi-Wan. He will lose Padm\u00e9. Or they will lose him.\n&gt;\n&gt;*All things die, Anakin Skywalker. Even stars burn out\u00a0\u2026*",

                    "comment": "I think that as the film goes on you see Anakin become more erratic and irrational. He\u2019s not getting any sleep because of his dreams, he\u2019s grieving the death of his mother, his wife\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s an intergalactic war going on and political disarray. Palpatine plays on this and feeds Anakin with propaganda, lies and misinformation in a way that Anakin believes palpatine is educating him about the truth and hypocrisy of the Jedi Order ( The scene where Palpatine tells him about how the force can be used to bring the dead back to life or communicate with the dead ) which Anakin had no knowledge of and felt the Jedi were hiding information from him. Plus Windu and Yoda do indeed refuse to let him on the council despite acknowledging his skill as a Jedi because they were afraid of the prophecy. I think all this pushed Anakin into a state of increasing neurosis and paranoia. \nYou see this in effect numerous times in the film. First his paranoia comes into effect when he explains he thinks Obi Wan and the Jedi Council secretly are against him to Padme, over and over again and wines and bitches to Obi wan like a petulant child. \nWhen he stops Mace from killing Palpatine, he breaks down and says \u201cwhat have I done\u201d. He is confused as hell and lost. At this point Palpatine has fully managed to manipulate Anakin to his will. \nLater when he sees Padme and Obi-wan stepping off the ship he thinks Obi-wan\u2019s stolen his girl because he\u2019s paranoid and neurotic and starts choking her even when she\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s not true. \nAnd then at the end he breaks down completely screaming, \u201cI hate you\u201d to Obi-wan. At this point he\u2019s totally messed up and basically mentally ill.\n\nEdit: Also going back to the point regarding the Jedi withholding information from Anakin and refusing to let him join the council, this is something Yoda realises at the end of the film. That perhaps his actions to hide information from Anakin and be overly cautious with him pushed him further to the dark side. Remember when Anakin seeks the advice from Yoda and Yoda kind of isn't honest and is holding concerns about him in his mind. That kind of goes against his own principles and Yoda, I think, realises that. That's why at the end of the film, Yoda tells Obi Wan that he can learn to communicate with his dead master, Qui-Gon Jinn. So Yoda learns from his own mistakes.",

    "postText": "Why did palpatine need the guards ? The most powerful Sith Lord with vader by his side. A man that powerful doesn\u2019t need guards I never understood the reasoning. Against Jedi they probably barely stand a chance aswell. Now if thrawn was the emperor I\u2019d understand the need for guards",

He was just a man at the top of the political ladder. Why wouldn't such a person be given guards? \n\n\nThe Praetorian Guard are also supposed to be effectively as good as Jedi in combat and fiercely loyal, to the point of brainwash, to the Emperor.\n\n\nHe's also the top of the food chain. Why should he be bothered by minor issues when he can send subordinates? Vader is like sending a nuke anywhere; it'll take care of the problem but was that much of an iron fist deserved?",

DS2 has hangers, turbolazer banks and a bunch of other stuff in Battlefront 2 (2018). While I'm not sure if the maps/muiltiplayer battles are canon, it seems unreasonable to assume the entire battlestation was inhabitable. Wait come to think of it don't we see the inside of the ds2 with Luke and Vader. Parts definitely were combat capable.\n\n&gt; the commenter above you mentioned that one of the story modes in Battlefront 2 had you saving prisoners.\n\nAssuming you mean Battlefront 2 (2005) that story campaign had you killing and defeating a rebel/jedi escape/revolt on ds1 as a stormtrooper. This is before A New Hope and no rebels escape.",

Imagine Luke running down a hallway slashing stormtroopers before making a quip with Han as they make their escape and then the camera just pans back to a bunch of guys screaming their heads off over their missing limbs.\n\nLike if Anakin came in there with a blaster or just brought some clones, it'd be one thing, but he fucking *bisected* 5 year olds. Talkin bits of them scattered around the room with some poor 501st guy to clean them up.",

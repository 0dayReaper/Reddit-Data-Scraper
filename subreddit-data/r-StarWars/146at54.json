    "postText": "So during the scene on mustafar (spelling?) Ewan McGregor grabs his lightsaber and draws it over his head and it ignites once back to his side, later. \n\nHowever, when looking close it seems like McGregor kinda \"pulses\" his arm when it's over his head. To me it looks like McGregor thought the blade was going to ignite while it was overhead. There's like a 2 phase pulse to the draw. \n\nRequest: is anyone able to Photoshop or edit that scene to where the blade ignites halfway in his draw when the speed of his arm shifts?",

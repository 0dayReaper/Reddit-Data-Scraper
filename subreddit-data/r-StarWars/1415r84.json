The Duel as a whole is amazing but idk, the middle and end always felt kind of a little weak to me. That first sequence after \"You will try\" just goes hard.\n\nANH: Death Star sequence (always loved seeing Imperial Bases and whatnot), Luke and Han on Turrets taking on TIEs\n\nESB: Asteroid Chase, Luke v Vader\n\nRotJ: Battle of Endor, Luke v Vader II Electric Boogaloo\n\nTFA: TR8R\n\nTLJ: nothing jumping out at me\n\nRoS: Kylo on Mustafar was pretty cool, Rey v Kylo on the DSII, Everybody showing up during the space battle",

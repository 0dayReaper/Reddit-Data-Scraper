    "postText": "for example: the clone wars used to be an animated show to compliment the prequel trilogy and gave us some really amazing stories. but since it got canceled they had to continue the plot lines that were to be continued on rebels and that really messed up a lot in my opinion.\n\nyou have to sit through 4 seasons of a whole new cast of characters just to see where darth maul, ahsoka tano, captain rex, etc. left off. so the ghost crew are all shoved into very personal arcs with the clone wars characters like darth maul looking for ben kenobi.\n\nand then rebels ends setting up the ahsoka show. so now you have to watch that. but that\u2019s only after you watch all 3 seasons of the mandalorian to understand it. oh wait, throw in the book of boba fett right in between season 2 and 3 of the mandalorian because that\u2019s important too.\n\nand you have to deal with the switch between animation to live action as well. it\u2019s all so jarring, complicated and messy. i hate how such a good cartoon turned into \u201cthe filoni verse\u201d. which is a new retelling of heir to the empire but now features ahsoka and sabine!\n\nsolo exists and has a darth maul cameo where q\u2019ira goes\u2026 somewhere? that\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon. darth maul died a year before solo came out. what else is there to tell with him?\n\nit\u2019s a basic opinion but genuinely rogue one and andor are the only star wars we\u2019ve seen that\u2019s consistent and doesn\u2019t require a hundred shows that range vastly in quality to watch.",

Given what happened in the intervening time it's an evolution that makes a lot of sense, but you don't get a sense from Mando that is has happened at all. The show spends a lot of time with her but it tiptoes around her previous actions, like her warcrimes or being involved in the overthrow of her sister's reign etc.\n\nAll of this makes the character work fine for live-action-only viewers (I hadn't seen the character in anything else when I first watched Mando S2) but if you've seen the cartoons it's a more complicated issue that isn't really addressed.",

We pretty much know what was planned for the remainder of Clone Wars and lot of it either got released in other forms (Dark Disciple as a book, Son of Dathomir as a comic, Crystal Crisis as an animation) or reworked into Disney-era S7. The rest were a series of Clone Wars-era stories, not the things that happened in Rebels.",

Yeah that works. We need a new Sith Lord, so uh......Kylo Ren! Yeah cool. Also....Palpatine is just...back to life again!\n\nNow we just need to cram this entire sequel storyline into three episodes, and bring back actors who thought they were long done with Star Wars and had moved on.\"\n\nHarrison Ford did not want to be Solo again. He was tired of that role. Just like he's tired of Indiana Jones. Like c'mon people. Just let it die in peace and be the amazing thing it is.

Mando merchandise for example is everywhere all the time, not just \u201cseasonal\u201d, being put out to satisfy licensing contracts. That indicates that people like it and it is not artificially propped up to market the show. Lucasfilm can talk as much as they want about how much people like the ST characters. But money talks and BS walks and for all the fuss made about \u201cwhere\u2019s Rey\u201d when when TFA came out and there wasn\u2019t much Rey merch, I certainly saw it piling up on clearance when the subsequent movies came out, and hardly a single item has been released since. There have been no Rey action figures released since RoS. There have been no Finn action figures released since TLJ! He didn\u2019t even get much merch for his last film! For comparison they are still releasing Book of Boba Fett merchandise. If the characters were popular, and I\u2019m not just talking about popular with angry fanboys, you would be seeing them all over the place because the smart thing to do would be to keep them in the public consciousness to support future movies or shows. The fact we see the opposite of this means Lucasfilm is likely going to attempt a massive course correction if and when they do reappear. But right now Disney is acting like they are brand poison so the simplest explanation is that they are.",

I want to say the actor has distanced himself from StarWars ever since.\n\nWhile the trilogy made a fuckton of money, reviews got worse with each movie. Solo basically bombed (personally I liked it but it prob hurt TROS turnout besides TLJ)\n\ndoing the tv series have salvaged StarWars as a brand bc after TROS, nobody was clamoring for another trilogy (which was supposed to be in the works with Rion). which is why they put that series on hold and moved on from Rion.\n\nEven if some ppl didn't exactly like Boba Fett and Kenobi.",

Still need to add some water slides and some light panel lining. Overall really happy with it.  \nWanted to see what Aerial would look like in black and metallic silver/red colors and it didn't disappoint. Wish I was better at taking photos, looks so much better irl :(  \nColors - Gundam Metallic Red, Tamiya - Gunmetal, Tamiya - Gloss Black Tamiya - Flat Black  \nThrew a side by side comparison to a snap built one. Going to paint the other one Jedi colors :)",

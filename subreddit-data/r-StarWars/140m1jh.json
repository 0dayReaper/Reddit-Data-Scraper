    "postText": "Ok so it wasn't a shower thought I was watching Clone Wars and in it a Rodarian collapsed exhibiting the signs of a heart attack (he was poisoned) and Padme called out for \"help\".\n\nGot me thinking whoever is qualified to help would have to know Rodarian biology, right? Like what if Rodarians have two hearts? Or six hearts? Or no heart? Like do paramedics in Star Wars know every individual biology/anatomy? That's A LOT of information given the seemingly endless varieties of intelligent life. \n\nBacta can't just fix everything across the board can it?\n\nAnyone have any Canon information on this? Or best guesses?\n\nTldr: health care in Star Wars is an intimidating profession.\n\nEdit: forgot about medical droids. That's got to be an invaluable resource!",

You might have living, breathing specialists in certain fields (like Dr. Pershing for cloning), but wherever you have a mixed population (like Coruscant or a spaceport), you'd want to have medical droids available.",

Star Wars docs probably have a little pseudo-AI in their little tablet or something that provides supplementary information and recommendations. \n\nActually, this has been covered; the doc bot thing on the *Twilight* way back in the Clone Wars theatrical release is able to recommend medical treatment for a young Huttlet, not exactly the most common species out there, and dispense medicine and directions to Ahsoka. Considering it\u2019s a beat up spice smuggler\u2019s vessel on some Outer Rim world, the core worlds likely have even better medical assistant tech.",

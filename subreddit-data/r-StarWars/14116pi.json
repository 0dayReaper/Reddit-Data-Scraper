            "comment": "So, NJO is hard, because it was basically them taking the scattered plotlines from the Bantam era and going \"RIGHT, THESE ARE ALL NOW COMING TOGETHER TO THIS\". So there's an easy way to skip some stuff but then not fully get what theyre following up on in NJO. \n\nSo, i'll basically give my spiel about the Bantaam era, with some modifications. \n\n* You have Truce at Bakura and the X-wing novels, detailing the initial ROTJ-Thrawn galactic civil war as the empire fractures and recedes and the alliance grows. \n\n* You have the Thrawn trilogy, which started the modern star wars expanded universe after it went into dormancy shortly after ROTJ came out. \n\n* You have Star Wars: Dark Empire, detailing a revived Palpatines attempted retakeover of the galaxy in 10 ABY. (written overlapping with thrawn, Zahn IG didn't like it and also wasn't super aware of it)\n\n* In the aftermath of those you have Star Wars: Crimson Empire which details a former imperial guard trying to make himself Emperor and you have the The Jedi Academy Trilogy and I,Jedi, which partially replaces the JAT and inserts a later character into it's story, set around 11 ABY detailing lukes first jedi students,\n\n* Following from there you have stories set in the 10ss ABY that aren't critical but help expand the era, like the \"Calista trilogy\" (Children of the Jedi, Dark-saber and Planet of Twilight) from 12-13 ABY about some stuff involving a lover of lukes thats... not super great but does give us things like the formation of the unified imperial remnant, and the crystal star (14 ABY... widely considered one of the worst EU novels) and the The New Rebellion which is set in 17 ABY and just sorta, there? Not bad, but not standout. You also have the black feet crisis trilogy,(Before the Storm Shield of Lies Tyrant's Test) set 16-17 ABY and detailing a lot of war stuff, if you like hard descriptions of how star wars warfare works read these.\n\n* Then you round out the galactic civl war era with the The Corellian Trilogy (18 ABY) detailing some stuff at Corellia and involving the solo children as characters and ends with the The Hand of Thrawn duology that ends the galactic civil war.\n\n* Between there and NJO you have the YA and Junior Novel series Young and Junior Jedi Knights, which make the next generation of the solo children actual characters doing YA and Junior novel stuff in the downtime between galactic crisis.\n\nOf these, the most critical are Thrawn, JAT/I,Jedi, hand of thrawn, and atleast a summary of the YJK as it's what really sets the characters for the next generation people that come into their own in NJO",

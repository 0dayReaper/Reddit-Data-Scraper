As much as I loved season 1 it definitely stayed in Mando\u2019s comfort zone in terms of where we went in the galaxy, which of course was necessary to establish his unique \u201crealm\u201d, for lack of a better term. But I\u2019m excited in this second season to see him stepping into the bigger galaxy of Star Wars, and hopefully seeing more familiar planets. The X-Wings definitely got me excited.\n\nAlso how weird was it to see a normal looking naval ship in the Star Wars galaxy?",

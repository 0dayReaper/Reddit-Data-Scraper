    "postText": "Many people knock The Phantom Menace. And of course Red Letter Media has a hilarious review. But after rewatching Episode I, it holds up well and I genuinely enjoyed it. \n\nThe sheer creativity, world building, and technical advancements made for that film warrant respect. \n\nLiam Neeson delivers an excellent performance, as does Natalie Portman. Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor also deliver, despite having supporting roles. \n\nJarJar isn\u2019t annoying. I enjoyed the comic relief as a kid. Now, as an adult, I can confidently say the criticism is overblown. And little Anie? Sure he flubs some lines, but his performance was endearing and pretty decent for a little kid. The hate is unjustified.\n\nThe plot is somewhat confusing and unnecessarily complicated. Sure, there are some plot holes and some strange choices. But the action sequences and lore building more than compensate. Two standouts are the final duel and the pod racing. Still gripping to watch. \n\nLastly, the score is out of this world. Duel of the Fates just crushes it. \n\nEpisode I was the first Star Wars film I ever saw. It definitely sparked my fandom and I quickly came to love the original trilogy. Are there valid critiques? Sure. But I gotta say it\u2019s a fun watch and a pretty good Star Wars flick.",

I don't hold it against anyone for enjoying Eps I or II, so long as you're not then turning around an then being hyperbolic about how bad the ST is.

Plus, it doesn't mesh well with the impression Obi gave us in the OT, as he makes it seem as if Annie was at least in his twenties, with Obi in his early thirties (kinda like Luke and Han).  \n\nIn addition to Annie being too young, him being a super kid who wins a death race, then flys a starfighter into battle, knocking out the enemies control ship (when none of the experienced (adult) pilots could even touch it) and him being some kind of Space Jesus, just seems like Star Wars was turning into a Spy Kids movie.\n\nThe queen also being a kid didn't help either,...and of course Space Goofy just pushed the movie over the edge and down that rabbit hole of,... I'm just too old for this kiddie shit.\n\nThis is what we got after waiting sixteen years for the next movie.  After teddy bears defeated the Empire, I guess should have seen this coming, but I guess I'd just blocked that part out.  :(",

Similar to how the original Star Wars revolutionized special effects in cinema. \n\nI hear you on the space politics. I don\u2019t mind space politics, but it was explored in a somewhat confusing manner. I also hear you on some of the dialogue. Notwithstanding, I really dig this movie. Lots to love here, though I can appreciate it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea (particularly those who grew up on the OT and had different expectations).",

And no-one feels a need to talk about it because *they were actually good movies*.  Crazy, I know.  The CGI was used tastefully and effectively and has aged well.  I mean, Toy Story was an incredible wonder of technology, which Lucas also was an important part of the story of, but the tech story is a footnote because it's unnecessary to know it to enjoy the movie.\n\nIn the prequels (and special editions) CGI is barfed all over the screen in ways that I'm sure were incredibly difficult to do technically but do little to advance the story.  The podrace sequence is stunning, but it's marred by bizarre choices like the idiotic two-headed announcer.  Jar Jar is a walking and talking monument to Lucas's lack of judgment and taste, however impressive it is fully in CGI.\n\nRegarding the politics, the prequels added nothing but noise.  It was pretty obvious from the first SW movie that the Empire were Space Nazis who had risen from the fall of the Space Weimar Republic.  The Rebel Alliance were a sort of Space Kreisau Circle coupled with various other partisan groups.  And there were Space Wizards with laser swords who were good and evil as appropriate to their political valence.  The prequels showed us a lot but it was all heavily implied in the original movies.  \"This is how democracy ends, with thunderous applause.\"  Yeah, no kidding.  This stuff might have been revolutionary if you're a kid, but if you saw the original films first and were old enough to have some knowledge of history, it was surplusage.\n\nIn the end the movie has more in common with Spy Kids than The Empire Strikes Back.",

Replace \"the republic\" with &lt;country x&gt;, \"the Jedi\" with &lt;national institutions&gt;, \"headless chickens\" with &lt;damn near every country body politic&gt; and \"the Emperor\" with &lt;charismatic right wing leader&gt; and it may well be about any contemporary country.\n\nWhich is not surprising.

Like you said Jar Jar wasn\u2019t annoying for me neither, he wasn\u2019t a good character but he didn\u2019t stink up the movie and make it worse. The worst part of the movie for me was the 20-30 minutes of politics which was probably the most boring part of the film. The child actor who played anakin was as good a child actor as I\u2019ve seen. The biggest flaw in this movie is not having enough Darth Maul. It\u2019s a 7/10 for me, just a solid movie that you can watch once in a while.",

Plus the tie fighter escaspe, and watching Rey live out my childhood dreams when she stole the Falcon and went on that chase, were awesome!\n\nI loved the creative use of the hyperdrive in all three movies, and Snoke's death was awesome!\n\nI also liked DJ's perspective on the whole thing.  His \"live free, don't join\" philosophy because its all just an endless exercise in futility, \"they blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow\".\n\nThe force skyping between Kylo and Rey was a cool addition to what the force can do.\n\nI loved the new hero being nobody for a change.  Really wish they had stuck to that.\n\nTROS was an entertaining escape from reality, but as a sequel to TLJ it sucked (because it undid all the things I liked about that movie) and as a saga ending I found it rather lazy.  Then again, all three trilogy endings were disappointing, so,...?\n\nAnyway, a lot of Star Wars was not made by George and even more of his ideas were just copied from other sources, so I don't have that requirement for Star Wars to be \"real\" Star Wars.",

TIE escape was funny, I even laughed out loud in cinema =) Rey was intriguing, Kylo was too. But overall I expected more and waited that 8th will expand and explain the new lore a bit more.  \n\n\nTLJ - at that time I just told myself that Disney is gonna make monies through fanservice, so didn't expect much. And everyone said that the movie was awful and stupid, so I was really interested in seeing it. \"Yo mama\" joke made me think SW is now marvel with it's humor, but it was fresh. Kylo\\\\Snoke relationship was very good, I could feel the hate and manipulation. Casino planet was a nice diversion that added depth to the universe and showed that there aren't just Empire and Rebels 2.0 out there. DJ was cool, I agree. Hyperram scene was AMAZING! Beautiful and surprising. Also Leia using the Force at the moment of shock was insanely cool, and I find it surprising people didn't get that scene. Finn\\\\Rose scene was pure \"prequel dialogue\" and Lucas'y and basically made me nostalgic =) And I really loved how Kylo has denounced both jedi and sith after all the manipulation and abuse and wanted to find a new way for himself. I really wanted to see how he and Hux gonna rule in 9th, a hysterical duo x) Only thing I didn't like was how Holdo decided to withhold the info about her plan, I thought it was pretty strange.  \n\n\nTRoS - it was just painful to watch. Sidious being \"somehow alive\" which I found bad in Legends was now in canon too. Kylo being basically his slave ruined his growth in 8th. Lack of logic (ships don't know how to fly without a single antenna, an ancient dagger looking exactly like recent death star wreckage, horses in space) completely ruined my suspension of disbelief and I find the movie just a stupid slideshow without any depth or sense.   \nAnd then Trevorrow script was leaked and I was amazed how Disney decided to not use it - it was a million times better than the 9th we got!  \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for the civil discussion between fans, I'm really tired of haters :)",

            "comment": "It absolutely doesn\u2019t hold up, at least to the original trilogy. It\u2019s not bad as a new sci fi action movie heavily reliant on CGI. Jar Jar is beyond annoying. He\u2019s the worst character in the Star Wars canon. Jake Lloyd, bless his heart, was a really bad child actor and is painful to watch in every scene he\u2019s in. The entire shiny FX aesthetic is a 180 from the rough \u201cdirty space future\u201d vibe that was one of the hallmarks and best aspects of the originals. The whole introduction of midichlorians was weird and totally unnecessary.\n\nIt has its moments. Darth Maul is awesome and one of the best SW villains (although, for the life of me, I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t incorporate him more). Ewan MacGregor does a fantastic job emulating Sir Alec Guinness. The pod race was a great action sequence. The Duel of the Fates fight was fantastic.\n\nBut, all in all\u2026 I think it\u2019s the worst of the 9 main SW films. It certainly was the most underwhelming when it came out. There is a reason EVERYONE that had grown up on the originals panned it when it came out.",

It's *awful* that the Galactic Republic didn't do more to stamp out slavery (hmmm, maybe he should have talked to a certain Chancellor \"friend\" about that when he got older). \n\nAnd I have to give a shout out to *TCW* for fleshing out Anakin's character enough that I actually like him up to *RotS.*\n\nBut Anakin's downfall is his own doing. \n\nDon't like that being in the Jedi Order means you have to keep your marriage secret? Not getting the emotional support you need to move on from your mother's tragic death? Leave the Order. The Jedi won't harm you. They can't take the Force from you. You already have a very well-to-do wife so it's not like you'll be cut off with no resources or support. And there's no indication your Jedi friends will stop talking to you unless you don't want to talk to them.  \n\nThere's absolutely *no justifiable reason* for you to join the Sith Lord that has been plotting against the Republic (Anakin might not have known the full extent of Palpatine's manipulations at that point but the fact that Palpatine was obviously grasping for power should have been enough of a red flag), attack your wife, go on a killing spree, and commit countless atrocities over the next 2 decades.",

Yes Palpatine manipulates him, yes the Jedi let him down, but it's his own insecurities and arrogance that make him vulnerable. We're supposed to sympathise with his fears but not his way of trying to overcome them because that's what makes him a tragic figure. His own choices turn him into Darth Vader.\n\nLuke redeems him through his unwavering faith - it's Luke who we should sympathise with",

He had nothing except his mother and he only had her for as long as Watto kept them together. \n\nWhen he left his mother, his rock in a sea of uncertainty, he latched on to Padme. She became this idealized woman in his mind and he kept holding on to her even through the life of a Jedi. He kept his image of her alive in his head and clung to it. \n\nHonestly, the Jedi were negligent in not getting Anakin some serious mental health intervention when he came on board. Putting that aside, when he became an adult, he failed to get the therapy he needed and instead continued to cling to Padme. \n\nAnd then Sheev started to prey on his fears of loss and losing the only thing that gave him security and peace and the rest of the story goes onward. \n\nBut it all falls back to him trying to find something solid to hold on to when he had nothing permanent to call his own. He was always a slave. To Watto, then to the Jedi, then to Palpatine. \n\nIt was only at the very end of his life that he stopped being one.",

He went off the deep end in his 20s when he had the necessary cognitive function and life experience to make other decisions. \n\n&gt;Do you honestly think that someone who went through literal indoctrination would be able to see within themselves that they need help beyond what is made available to them from their perceived saviors? \n\nThe key to avoiding indoctrination and instead make your own choices as to what you believe and what your lifestyle choices will be is exposure to other points of view, which Anakin does have. To blame \"Jedi indoctrination\" on Anakin's downfall when Anakin is perfectly capable of making his own decisions regarding what he believes is, in my opinion, wrong.

For example, he can't just \"leave the order\" all his friends and the man he literally said was like a father to him was in the order he'd be lost without it. And can you really blame him for falling in love when they stick him on a protection mission of natilie portman. \n\nJoining the sith lord was because sidious was lying to him that he could save padme and anakin's visions (which up to that point were all correct) said padme would die and the jedi kept ignoring him on his mother dying vision. Sidious promised him a way to protect the only person he truly cared about so ofc he'd wanna see that through. After padme dies he has no arms no friends and no bitches so he takes his anger out on the galaxy as unfair as that may be.",

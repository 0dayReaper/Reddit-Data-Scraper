    "postText": "Okay but Vader literally turned of the lights his chest to make an impression on the Rebels. That whole emerging from the darkness by the light of his saber thing? That was an intentional dramatic effect. What a drama king.\n\nLeia got away because he wasted 30 seconds scaring the crap outta those poor rebel mooks.\n\nPlus since they're Indicators, he would have had to turn his life support off. So he nearly died for drama.\n\nThe man flew into an underground temple standing on top of a tiefighter he was flying with the Force while he also made his cape billow dramatically in the nonexistent wind, He lives on Mustafar, the planet he lost 3/4 of his limbs. there is nothing Vader will not do for drama.\n\nI have decided Darth Vader doesn't actually rescue his son because he experiences a sudden powerful call to the Light, rather, overthrowing all his old allegiances at the absolute last minute and sacrificing his life for his son by destroying his shrieking wizard master in a storm of lightning and blue frame is the most dramatic thing he could do in that situation. \n\nAnd if there's one thing truly left of Anakin Skywalker. It's his instinctual drive to do the most dramatic thing at all times.",

I was just so absorbed with the gritty war aspect of it (guns, vehicles, fist-fighting) and so even when Vader started breathing, I just thought he was gonna force choke or slam them all.\n\nThen that saber ignited and I fucking lost it.

I don\u2019t get why all these Starkiller fans are desperate to have the character brought into canon when he will be changed to such an extent that he is basically a different character. In legends he\u2019s Vader\u2019s apprentice who sacrifices himself to help start the rebellion (as we know). That\u2019s not going to happen in canon. In canon, the most he will be would be an inquisitor that looks like Sam Witwer and the character would probably be killed off without doing anything of note. What\u2019s the point, lol.",

                    "comment": "Even though I like Starkiller, when I hear this I just think one thing: what\u2019s the point? There were two main things that defined the character: 1. HIS POWER LEVEL. I know he isn\u2019t as powerful in the novelisations, but he was still strong enough to take on Jedi masters and defeat Vader. So, far beyond any inquisitor. His power level is probably the main thing people associate with him. There isn\u2019t really scope in current canon to properly explore that. Disney/LFL aren\u2019t going to dedicate a series to him hunting down Jedi. If he were used in Ahsoka, it would more than likely be as an inquisitor who is very much nerfed from what he was in legends. So, essentially an unrecognisable character with the same name. Why not just create a new character in that case?                          2. HE IS KEY IN FORMING THE REBELLION. That\u2019s not going to happen in canon. So, the two main things that defined the character are gone, which makes the idea of using the character strange. By changing the character to fit him into canon, you change him to such an extent that it is basically an unrecognisable character with the same name. Why not just create a new character and leave Starkiller be.",

The big point of his story is that he defies Vader and the Emperor to help form the rebellion. By taking that away, he\u2019s no longer Starkiller. It\u2019s essentially a different character who has been given Starkiller\u2019s name and appearance. I like your idea of an inquisitor being involved in helping start the first order, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s Starkiller who should be shoehorned into the role. What you\u2019ve laid out is an interesting idea for a new character. I just don\u2019t understand bringing Starkiller back in such a way that he is basically a different character.",

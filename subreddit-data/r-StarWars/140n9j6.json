Sure, he killed the emperor and brought down the empire but he was also responsible for a lot that can't be forgiven. Especially when the representative of the Rebellion he'd first encounter would be Leia and he tortured her and blew up her home planet. She's not going to care that he's her biological family.\n\nReally all Luke could have done would be keep him hidden and then take him off to some other planet where he could live out the rest of his life in hiding. BUT, how do you hide the fact that you're Darth Vader when you look like that?",

Force Unleashed, Fallen Order and even the cancelled Floor 1313 were all humans. Unless I'm missing something I don't think there are any that has a diverse lead. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the look of Outlaws. Fallen Order I'd great and so is FU but at this point I'll take a gangster sim as a hutta.",

Maybe Outlaws has different main characters, I guess we don't know enough yet.",

In an RPG, having the different species having different base stats and a few special abilities would make sense as this can influence a character build and thus increase the replayability of the game by doing a different build run. \n\nIn generic action games, it really doesn't matter much. It is just easier to use a human as less work is required to model them through all the actions the player character could make than any of the near human species. The only exception would be a Chiss, but that is just a blue skinned human.",

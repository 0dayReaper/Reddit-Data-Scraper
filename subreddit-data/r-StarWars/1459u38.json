    "postText": "Making Rey a long lost Palpatine for me made no sense especially making her the daughter of Palpatine's son, like again where does the logic come in? But rather than making her Palpatine's granddaughter, I would have fixed her parentage in one of these following ways\n\n\n- 1- Making Rey a long lost daughter of Luke which to me would have made sense especially since she was the one to find Luke in the first place and had no lightsaber training and was able to master the Force in relatively short time. Luke training his own daughter again would have made sense making her the granddaughter of Anakin which in turn would have made her Han &amp; Leia's niece. At least that would have been more believable.\n\n- 2- Making Rey a long lost Kenobi would have also made sense especially if they made her either a daughter or granddaughter of Obi Wan\n\n- 3- Making Rey a long lost Jinn would have also made sense too \n\n- 4- Making her a daughter of Ezra Bridger too would have also have worked too",

He's a *strandcast*. A chimera of DNA from many sources. His main template was Palpatine's but his DNA came from many sources.  Think of all the Jedi that were killed and collected during Order 66. Not to mention Anakin Skywalker was brought into medical facilities by Palpatine. Grogu had been captured for a time.  Luminara Unduli  was alive and captured after Order 66 and all the Inquisitors and the force sensitive babies that were retrieved from across the galaxy in Project Harvester. \n\nRey could have  DNA from all kinds of force users through her strandcast father. Her father wasn't force sensitive so Palpatine rejected him but something switched on with Rey. That's why he wanted to find her. Imagine the potential of her children.",

The inherent power of being Palpatine with all the force potential of the Chosen One/his son/bloodline\u201d.\n\nCome on, you know he definitely tried that at least once.\n\nIf they revealed that that was the DNA combo for Dathan that would be pretty cool, and make Rey an actual Skywalker/Luke\u2019s granddaughter or niece.",

The flashback establishes that she was definitely old enough to know who they were and to remember.\n\nIt was the audience that latched on to Rey's parents as some kind of mystery to be explained.

Because that plot line is now a waste of time.\n\nRey's parentage is not a plot line in TFA. It's barely even a question raised by TFA. There's no time spent searching for answers to it.

Not out of love, or anything like that, but purely as a political move. Trying to sell himself as a family man, type of politician. \n\nBut, this is Palpatine we're talking about. He has no need for a family or attachments. So, he orchestrates the death of his wife and child. Maybe, trying to pin it on some political opponent.\n\nUnfortunately for Palpatine, his wife wasn't as dim as he'd hoped. And before he gets her and their child killed,she fakes their deaths. Palpatine still got his sympathy votes, so he never cared much for the truth behind their \"deaths\".\n\nPalpatine's child would eventually have a child of their own, and that child would eventually have Rey.\n\nOnce Rey's parents discovered that she was force sensitive, they would then leave her with Luke for training. Believing that he would have the ability to prevent Rey from falling to the darkside, like he once brought back Vader. \n\nOr something like that :S",

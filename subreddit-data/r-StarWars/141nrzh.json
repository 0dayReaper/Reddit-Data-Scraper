            "comment": "I mean, it's a little more obvious in hindsight. But keep in mind that we don't have any hint that it'd be Ahsoka, the voice is distorted and lowered, the first Season didn't really have any other Clone Wars connections, the Clone Wars was done at the time (S7 was not announced), and Ahsoka was nowhere near as important as she is these days. Prior to Rebels, Ahsoka was *only* in TCW. Now, she's in TCW, Rebels, Tales of the Jedi, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, etc.\n\nIt seems obvious in hindsight because, for one, you know that it's her, but also because she is increasingly more important as time goes by so she would be an obvious choice. Back then, not so much.\n\nIm sure people speculated, but it's not like it was a given that everyone knew. It was certainly a surprise to most.",

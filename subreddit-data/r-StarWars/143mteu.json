    "postText": "I have an extensive collection of original Kenner Star Wars toys.  None of them are in original packaging, I played with all of them but they are in good condition.  I\u2019m ready to part with them.  What\u2019s the best way?  Sell them individually on EBay?  Sell the lot to a toy shop?  I\u2019d like to maximize my profit but don\u2019t want to spend all my time executing this.",

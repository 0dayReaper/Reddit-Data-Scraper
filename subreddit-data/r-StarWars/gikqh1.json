The star wars legends series is the original (pre disney) canon. \n\n\"After a promise made to a dying\u00a0Fenn Shysa, Fett became\u00a0Mandalore\u00a0and eventually led the Mandalorians through the\u00a0Yuuzhan Vong War. Originally working as a\u00a0mercenary\u00a0for the extra-galactic invaders, Fett later aided the\u00a0New Republic\u00a0in their battle against the aliens. When the\u00a0Yuuzhan Vong\u00a0assaulted\u00a0Mandalore\u00a0and bombarded the planet's surface, a large deposit of\u00a0Mandalorian iron\u00a0was unearthed, ironically helping to strengthen the Mandalorians.\nLater, during the\u00a0Second Galactic Civil War, Boba, who was still leading the Mandalorians, was plagued by ailing health. He found his granddaughter,\u00a0Mirta Gev, and the two went on many missions together, even alongside Han Solo. Fett also trained Solo's daughter\u00a0Jaina\u00a0to kill her twin brother,\u00a0Darth Caedus, and assisted the\u00a0Jedi Coalition\u00a0in\u00a0several\u00a0battles. Ultimately, Fett's training helped Jaina bring down Caedus, though an\u00a0Imperial\u00a0nanovirus\u00a0attack\u00a0prevented Fett from ever returning to Mandalore.\"\n\nThe part where he works with Han Solo and his daughter Jaina was pretty exciting stuff. Boba fett is one of the most badass characters in the entire Star Wars universe.",

Disney has owned star wars since 2012-2013 so well say 8 years. The star wars universe is a bit older than 8 years, starting in 1977. There are hundreds of comics, hundreds of books, and several films that span that time. All of which were made before disney took over. This was all the medium for an intricately woven and cohesive universe that spanned thousands of years and countless characters. I was merely spreading some insight to other people. It's always fun to know more about some of the cooler characters.",

The artist took the liberty of saying that Boba took contracts on Luke and/or Ben Kenobi and won, and took their sabers as trophies.\n\nThe reason he knew they were those two is because the emitter designs are the same as Luke ans Bens.  Every Jedi and Sith builds their own emitter, so each one is like a fingerprint of that Jedi or Sith.",

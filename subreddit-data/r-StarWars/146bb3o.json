Fuck yeah, it's an awesome game, much like Witcher 1 it hasn't aged well in terms of gameplay but the stories and characters are just so good",

The action takes place in real time, although combat is divided into \u201crounds\u201d during which each participant takes one action (or more with certain buffs). It\u2019s based on *Dungeons and Dragons*, if you\u2019re at all familiar with that.\n\nThe graphics are not especially good even by the standards of the time. It could easily pass for a late 90\u2019s PC game despite being released in 2003. \n\nThe story, characters, and role-playing are what make the game so memorable for many players. If fast-paced action or high-fidelity graphics are what you\u2019re most interested in, I\u2019d look elsewhere.",

The combat is real time but turn based, so you can pause, give orders to allies, and then resume, Clunky but you get used to it. \n\nGraphics? It's a 2003 game, so it's not stunning by today's standards. There are mods that do make it a little less blocky, though. \n\nAs far as the story? Triple distilled, quarter cask \"all the shit that makes Star Wars fun.\" Again, written by the guys who did Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and the head writer whipped up the Bane Trilogy. So, it's top shelf stuff if you can stomach the clunky gameplay.",

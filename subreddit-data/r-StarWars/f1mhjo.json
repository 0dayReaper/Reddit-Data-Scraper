Lucas didn't give a fuck about it, if he wanted to make a movie that contradicted a book, not only did he not give a shit but he never read the book in the first place.  The \"timeline\" for the EU was tenuous at best.  \n\nDo you know how many people in the EU touched the death star plans?  Too many to count.  Which one of the billion stories do you even stick into your \"timeline\"?  \n\nI don't know, I'm not a big of fan of this revisionist history, where we suddenly pretend like the EU was this coherent well-thought out document that Lucas or any producers ever gave two shits about.  If Lucas made VII, VIII, and IX do you *really* think he wouldn't have over-written the EU in a heart-beat?  At least now, there's people that consider the lore told in all of the various media and while not perfect, it's at least able to be followed now.",

We know you were a stormtrooper who killed your commanding officer!\u201d\n\n...what?\n\nEven if that\u2019s the way you want to go, it was so narratively jarring. It had nothing to do with the story or scene at hand. And this stuff happened in the old EU all. The.

In this picture, the speeder is supported by an arm connected to the metal frame you can see behind it. This is what they are using when the speeder is parked. There will often be a convenient object of some kind in the foreground that happens to hide the support structure.\n\nThey had the same speeder attached in the end of a much longer arm with a counterweight on the other end. This one could float and appear to move as the whole assembly rotated around the frame supporting it in the middle of the arm.",

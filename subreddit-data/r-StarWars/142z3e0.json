Then there was the Padawan Naq Med, who left just prior to the Clone Wars and would fend off the Grand Inquisitor years later during the reign of the Empire.",

            "comment": "The lightsaber belongs to the one who builds it, not the order itself. A large percentage of lightsabers were  likely built with personalized, customized materials and tech, which would specifically benefit the builder. Some designs (like GrandMaster Yoda\u2019s) were specifically sized to his smaller hands, or Dooku\u2019s Curved hilt that helped with his dueling / fencing style, even Mauls double bladed saber was specific to him. (However if a Jedi were to fall during battle, the order would collect the Kyber Crystal from the fallen, and return it to the temple, to preserve its force energy\u2026)",

            "comment": "It seems to be a personal choice for the one leaving. I can think of multiple Jedi who left (in canon) and kept theirs. In fact the only one I know of who did not was Ahsoka, and I suspect that was probably because they were confiscated due to her being charged with a crime and put on trial, and afterwards she just walked away, probably not wanting to endure the indignity of asking for them back after the whole ordeal.",

            "comment": "I'll just transfer my answer from a yesterday unrelated thread: \n\nIt's not strictly enforced, but you are *expected* to surrender your lightsaber upon leaving. After all, the lightsaber is a weapon of a Jedi Knight, and if you no longer a Jedi Knight, it stands to reason to leave the badge of office behind. It's a sign of commitment to your decision. \n\nBut nobody would hunt you down to claim you blade if you don't.",

The second line is an old school New Orleans tradition, it can follow any event from a wedding or parade down to a funeral. We started out with a brass band playing some slow, sombre music, all the people walking behind just crying our eyes out. But as we matched on, the bad picked up the tempo and pace, making things feel more upbeat and happy. It was wild how it really helped all of us process the grief. Something like this is in the same vein, and I hope it helped them deal with the grief the same way it helped us.",

Right before college I was so extremely close to being a full member with my metal armor that I made myself by scavenging computer casings and car hoods. Only had to paint the helmet I bought but then college started and I lost the space and time. This was eight years ago at this point but even then the community online was so welcoming and tight-knit. The camaraderie was second to none and everyone was extremely helpful and encouraging. Events like this were also common, whether for things like weddings or the unfortunate passing of a member. Truly a wonderful community full of great people. Vode An!",

They use to do like monthly podcasts, had a magazine they\u2019d release with a cool Mando fan-fic story, and the forums were pretty lively. Met a lot of the members, including some of the governing ones at Celebration 2015. It was an awesome time, I definitely gotta get back into it.",

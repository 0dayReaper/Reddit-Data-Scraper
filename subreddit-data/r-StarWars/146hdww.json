The lightsaber is really cool but I would never spend that much on it in a vacuum. \n\nHowever, it was one of the single coolest experiences of my entire life. The toy itself may not be worth the price, but the overall experience absolutely is. Every single employee commits 100% and makes it feel special. There were kids, seniors and every age in between, and none of us feel silly at all. \n\nI\u2019d reccomend it to anyone, just don\u2019t expect the  super duper high quality lightsaber replica you could get from a custom builder for the same price. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend picking up a holocron and few other kyber crystals as well.",

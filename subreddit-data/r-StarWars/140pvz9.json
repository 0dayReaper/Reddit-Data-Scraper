He also doesn't end up suffering from stock character syndrome like the other clones do. \n\n2). The Bad Batch\n\nI lump them together as they have that stock crew of characters that show up in action movies. It's a good concept, and I will say Star Wars did it well with them. \n\n3). Rex\n\nHe gets a lot of screen time but still comes off as a generic stock character. There is almost always an experienced older officer in a lot of military fiction. Rex just happens to get a lot of screen time, thanks to being with Anakin and Ahsoka. \n\n4). All the rest\n\nThey are all generic stock characters in military fiction. They follow one of several different archetypes.",

I'm a sucker for the \"tough guy on the outside, softie with a heart of gold on the inside\" trope and his relationship with Omega is super wholesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor regs, I'll sing with the choir here. Captain Rex is by far the best fleshed out clone, and just an overall well written character. Cool as hell and I love seeing his own growth from the start of The Clone Wars to the end of Rebels, and I'm excited to see him show up in Ahsoka!",

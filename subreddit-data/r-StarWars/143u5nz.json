To a certain extent, the Jedi *must* capitulate to politics, since \u201cplaying ball\u201d is the best method for enabling them to actually fulfill their mandate.\n\nThe EU books cover this fairly well as we see Luke Skywalker navigate the New Republic bureaucracy as he rebuilds the Order. Luke has to ask himself all these questions and often finds himself on the wrong end of the political stick.\n\nWhat Luke went through post-RotJ can be viewed as a microcosm of the organic journey the Order took as it developed during the Old Republic.",

So no it wouldn\u2019t destroy their principle.\n\n\u201cThe Order tends to be what it needs to be for any particular time. Sometimes, we're warriors, fighting the forces of evil. Sometimes, we are teachers, bringing the light of knowledge to the galaxy. Sometimes, we govern. Sometimes, we do the opposite -- drawing inward, studying the Force and its mysteries. Sometimes, we explore. Sometimes, we do all of those things. And sometimes... we are carved down to almost nothing. Those who are left must bear the responsibility of being one last bit of light in a galaxy filled with endless dark.\"",

The Mandalorian wars were a really big thing in their history, for example. \n\nWhen a faction threatens the republic they threaten the lives of countless people the Jedi devote themselves to protecting. It doesn\u2019t mean that joining the republic was the 100% correct choice, but it also isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve chosen to directly involve themselves in something that doesn\u2019t just involve the sith or other force groups. Plus, they had reason to suspect the sith were involved.",

            "comment": "&gt;Before the jedi were an independent warrior group that was not part of any war unless it was about the force\n\nThis is a myth by the way. At least as far as old canon is concerned. The only time when the Jedi were not part of the Republic was in Dawn of the Jedi era when there was no Republic to speak of, and even then Jedi on occasion would participate in the local war in the Typhon system. \n\nAnd In the new canon timeline as far as we're aware the jedi always been with the Republic - since the timeline for now ends in the High Republic times, and the Jedi are with the Republic as usual. \n\nIn general however, the Jedi can't do what they do and remain independent from the government. They only can function as peacekeeper force when they are granted legal powers of law enforcement and support from the rulers - and by proxy from the rulers, by citizens of the Republic. Without that, the jedi would be seen as meddlers with magical powers who are unaccountable to anyone but themselves, and whose claims at neutrality can't be verified. Nothing destroys trust as fast as being unaccountable superhuman running around and poking his nose in everyones' business. \n\nOnly by tying themselves to the Republic the Jedi can gain enough trust to operate freely, and throgh cooperation with other government institutes the Jedi can optimize their work by resolving the biggest conflicts with their VERY LIMITED manpower.",

So they became dependent on one another to kill Sith.\n\nAnd when the Sith lay low, the Jedi were still in the position of needing to prop up the Republic because they were still dependent on Republic resources, whether they admitted it or not.",

            "comment": "The Jedi joined the Republic as a show of good faith to the population.  That they were willing to submit to the same laws as them and were not above them.  This was just after another war with the Sith that ended in their supposed destruction.\n\nAlso being part of the government gives them authority to actually do things such as negotiate or enforce laws.  Otherwise they have no more authority then your neighbor down the street.  We see them use this authority and being part of a bigger system to help people on planets like Pijal and Carnelion IV.  It also allows them resources to better reach people throughout the galaxy on things like relief missions or working with the Judicials when going to Naboo in TPM.\n\nThem joining the Clone Wars was  a better option than sitting out because people were going to see it as them abandoning the galaxy in it's greatest time of need.  Remember it's the Senate and the Chancellor who voted to create the GAR and go to war.  If the Jedi, who are seen as their protectors and these problem solvers just decide to do nothing, you better believe Palps is going to use that resentment as fuel for an Order 66.  Also, them joining the war did help people on planets like Ryloth or Mon Cala.  It also helped the Clones in giving them commanders who saw them as individuals and cared about them unlike people such as Tarkin.\n\nLegends also provides a unique contrast in that during the Old Republic era the Jedi did decide not to be part of a war and that decision is often criticized by the fandom because it was devastating.  Yet now when war threatens again, the criticism is flipped.  Even though both wars have a lot of citizens in the crossfire.\n\nAs a final note, I always find this topic interesting with the fandom as a whole.  Because there are those who share your opinion saying the Jedi were too political just by virtue of being with the Republic and choosing to be drafted as generals.  Yet I've seen others point out their avoidance of politics by not having a say in the democratic process was a flaw too.  For me I don't think they were really that deep into politics in Canon.  But the fandoms waring opinions to me shows that this isn't such a cut and dry topic of one way being better than the other.",

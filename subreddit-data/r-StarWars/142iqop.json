Moff Calixte became one of my favorite characters of the saga. \n\nTo be fair, it has a *lot* of that late-90s / early-00s 'edginess' that was in style at the time -- \"our Skywalker hero is a drug addict\"; \"the Empire are (kind of) an anti-hero faction now\"; etc. Didn't bother me enough to be a deal-breaker, but probably is the weakest element of the series.",

            "comment": "A lot of it is Star Wars through the lens of a Linkin Park song, ridiculously over the top in its attempts to be edgy and grim. Cade Skywalker is just Luke/Anakin Skywalker after being dragged backwards through Hot Topic. \n\nThe fact that not only are the Sith inexplicably back in the future, but now there are more of them than ever is something which fans of the comics seems bizarrely unbothered by considering \u201cdiminishing Anakin\u2019s sacrifice\u201d is something the sequels got hauled over the coals for just for bringing back Darth Sidious, and yet this story does something a thousand times more egregious and gets a pass. Darth Krayt is at first an interesting antagonist, but arguably never gets more interesting than &gt;!prior to his \u201cdeath\u201d, and his return without the cool design of his Vonduun crab armour does little to improve him.!&lt;\n\nAll in all I\u2019d say the series is a mixed bag. There\u2019s some good elements I\u2019d still like to see reincorporated, but all in all I\u2019m very happy this isn\u2019t the ultimate future of Star Wars.",

Looking now it hasn\u2019t aged as well but still has some cool moments and characters. The concept of imperial knights and their silver lightsabers while wearing royal guard armor was something my 17 year old self literally creamed over. \n\nAt the risk of sounding a bit too negative. I blame this story as one of the factors that made a part of the fandom craze over the concept of grey Jedi that so many people roll their eyes back on from the cringe. That being the concept of a Jedi renegade able to use both the light side and the dark side with little to no consequences. (I was one of those that fell for it. Precisely because of Cade Skywalker)",

Nothings been learned there. The emperor? Sure he currently serves the light but our only guard on that is that his bodyguards will murder him if he stops doing so, hardly a recipe for success. And even then the sith are like \"hey we can help :)\" and the empire is just \"hell yeah!\" and are i guess pikachu faced when the sith then take them over and also genocide the jedi.\n\nI think the one sith are neat as an evolution of the idea of the sith, i think seeing OT stuff but actually futurized is neat, but when one of the core factions is telling me \"we're better\" and it isn't but i'[m still supposed to think it is   it just sort of spoils the whole experience.",

It should've been common knowledge that people saw Clones March into the Jedi temple Building and then after that, the Jedi were no more.\nDid the people know the clones Were the ones to extinguish the Jedi?",

Now I\u2019m going on a limb with this, feel free to call me out but I feel like this came from rebels or something similar, but people were told as well that they were actually evil.",

They are focused only on serving their \u201cmission\u201d and don\u2019t care about the people they are supposed to be protecting.  Most people living in the galaxy would never have a reason to come into contact with Jedi unless they were in trouble/wanted, a parent of a force sensitive, a soldier in the war, or they were a government official.  It was easy for the seeds of the empire to plant negative propaganda about the Jedi since every where they went, war and destruction followed!  Since nobody outside of their order knew what their agenda was, it was easy for their rivals to create that narrative for them.  The Jedi didn\u2019t have a PR team to combat this propaganda.  \n\nAccording to the government, the Jedi tried to take power through violence but the brave clones were able to fight them back and save our brave senators from certain doom.  It\u2019s amazing the parallels that can be drawn into the real world.",

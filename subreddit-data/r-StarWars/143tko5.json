    "postText": "Before I'm crucified I do like her character. I just feel like a lot of the fandom are obsessed with her, to the point she's even some people's favorite Jedi.\n\nTo me I feel like she started somewhat as a plot device. A young strong character in the Clone Wars show for young viewers to identify with. Now they cma imagine and daydream they're in her shoes being Anakin's Padawan. \n\nI think she grew into more as the show went on for sure, and she had great character development. And I'm excited for the show. I just feel like now Dave Filoni is pushing all his own creations into the new live action shows.\n\nDon't get me wrong, they're great. I just want new stuff rather than more Ahsoka. Now I'm just rambling and don't know where I'm going with it. \n\nBottom line, I think she's a cool character but I don't get why people love her to the level they do.",

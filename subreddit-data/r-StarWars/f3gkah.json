Being overprotective of those who he thinks of as the little guy.\n\nHis mom- gets tortured and he goes crazy in retribution.\n\nTons of examples of him going off the walls in clone wars.\n\nThen there\u2019s these two scenes. Palpatine got him to fall by playing on this virtue, and look got him back by playing on it again.\n\nWhile Anakin did change a lot as a character that has stayed fundamentally the same.",

His fears, that's why the Jedi keep harping on about fear, hate and suffering.\n\nAnakin's life before the Jedi was incredibly unstable and uncertain. They were slaves, they couldn't control any aspect of their lives.\n\nThat makes Anakin very afraid to lose anything he cares for. And fear is a loss of control, it's an emotion that is easily manipulated. Those who are afraid to lose will move to mitigate their loss rather than accept a loss for a bigger gain.\n\nAnakin's fear of loss made him quick to anger, quick to act irrationally and aggressively. Quick to attack perceived threats rather than move to understand them. Quick to turn to hate. The kind of hate that would move him to exterminate a whole tribe including the innocents when faced with loss.\n\nWhen Anakin finally fell to the dark side by defending Palpatine, he was motivated by his fear of losing access to the secret that would provide him with control over losing people from his life. That's not a virtue, that is some intense dark side stuff. An inability to deal with the fear that is so strong he wanted to be able to demand control over who lives and dies.\n\nAnd just like his fear often turned to hate. His hate ultimately leads to his suffering. Vader wasn't a mindless thrall, he was so filled with self-loathing that he no longer believed he could turn from his path. He'd rather lose himself in the anger and the hatred than face his own acts as a first step towards redemption.",

The scenes using miniature sets also have *much* better compositing so they don't look so much like CGI.\n\nYou can see a similar thing with the theatrical cuts of the original trilogy. There are scenes in the older versions of ANH where ships have a very noticeable border around them and/or don't shift with perspective as they move across the field of view, giving away that they're basically just a cutout. ESB and ROTJ have far fewer instances of those issues, and even when they're present they're far less noticeable. Later versions of ANH generally clean up the compositing to be comparable to ESB's quality.",

Attack of the Clones, and to an even greater extent Revenge of the Sith, feel like shorthand summaries of a much greater story that just couldn't be told within the confines of a trilogy. It's a good story, a really interesting and poetic story, it just falls on its face because it's being told within two movies where it should have been a 5 or 6 season modern tv series.",

It was his insistence that Palpatine was \"too dangerous to be left alive\" that changed Anakin's mind.\n\nNotice that there are two times in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin is especially troubled. The moments before he stops Mace from killing Palpatine is one of them. The other is when he has Dooku helpless in front of him, and executes him because, according to Palpatine, he's \"too dangerous to be left alive\". \n\nThe decision to execute the defeated Dooku very obviously didn't sit well with Anakin. When he discovered Palpatine was the Sith Lord they were searching for, it surely made so much more sense. Jedi were better than that. He'd been tricked by the Sith Lord. And yet, the moment Mace had that Sith Lord defeated in front of him, just as Anakin did, he said the same thing. It turned out that the Jedi are no different from the Sith. They're perfectly willing to kill helpless foes.\n\nAnakin being there or not might not have mattered, if Mace had still been there. If it had been Yoda, or even if it had been Anakin and a group of other Jedi, things might have turned out differently. But Mace Windu, specifically, was the wrong person at the wrong time, and sent an already-struggling Anakin spiraling into darkness.",

JJ and Rian's visions were both completely valid continuations of the story that completely clash with each other, and the movies are so thematically inconsistent because of it. Rian tells us Rey's identity doesn't matter, which on its own is actually a great decision with thematic relevance, but given that JJ's movie clearly tells us that Rey's identity does matter it feels like complete bullshit.\n\n\nSadly it just feels like both directors being fans of Star Wars had thought about what they would want out of a new Star Wars trilogy and since they'd been thinking about it so long just ignored what had already been established by the other.\n\n\nWhenever the next trilogy comes I hope they just stick to one person or one group of people to write the story for all three, or at least lay out all of the key points before hand and stick to those unless the story naturally flows in another direction because of actor chemistry or whatever, and have directors who share that vision so they aren't creatively restrained.",

On the one hand, reducing Luke and Kylo backstory explanations to short flashbacks was probably to fit into how constrained TFA's circumstances for Luke were. On the other hand spending a bunch of time on Canto Bight and a contrived conflict between Poe and Holdo (by which I mean the character doesn't seem to have a throughline to her actions, well planned or unintelligent, that makes them consistent with each other) was something RJ elected to spend the film's time on instead of trying to flesh out the most controversial aspect of his story. \n\nDecisions like the Hyperspace ram have major effects on the universe no matter how much you try to allude to them in your own narrative, and \"The First Order Reigns\" is not a line that plays into the story that unfolds specifically within this movie, so it's bizarre for what it suggests about the worldbuilding if you trust the director at his word about the story he's trying to tell.",

I want you to join me. *We can rule together and bring a new order to the Galaxy.*\" I was so into it until that last sentence hits. \n\nWe had a peek into the idea subverting the typical Star Wars theme. It would have even paired really well with *The Force Awakens*. We all know it was basically a redo of *A New Hope*, but it could have been used as like a sort of demonstration that the Galaxy is just constantly suffering from both the Jedi and Sith and their feuds for power. It's the same story every time and they even made a point in *Rise of Skywalker* to show us that it's always been the same two families. Up until Kylo delivers that specific line, I was still pumped for Disney's Star Wars.",

He had no family, he had to hide his wife (or to be more precise his relationship to his wife), his mentor was too harsh with him in the beginning and too friendly in the end. So what does that leave him? Tha Jedi Code. And the moment he realizes that not even one of the most powerful and most acknowlegded Jedi acts after that code, he is completely lost.\n\nAnd to be real: if anyone of us had to decide between two sides we would see as equally corrupted by power and equally arrogant, who wouldn't decide to side with the one that promises to save our loved ones?\n\nWell yeah and Yoda's \"Dying is someone you love?

Anakin didn't decide to try to kill Obi-Wan because he'd killed the younglings, but because he'd decided the Jedi had betrayed him. I think you could adjust this. Maybe Anakin feels the Jedi have lost their way, and they're trying to kill him and Palpatine, but he doesn't feel betrayed yet. Rather, maybe he confronts Obi-Wan because Obi-Wan comes to him over the crimes. You get the same \"From my point of view, the Jedi are evil\" thing, they argue and fight. At this point, Anakin feels wronged and that he needs to defeat the Jedi, but doesn't necessarily hate them.\n\nObi-wan didn't necessarily want to kill Anakin at all, but was left with no choice. He was there to stop him, because he'd killed the younglings. If Anakin had already killed other Jedi and Obi-Wan knew, he might confront Anakin over that instead.\n\nCombined with the Jedi idea that the Sith are irredeemably evil already, and you have an easy way into the same battle. When the battle ends with Obi-Wan dismembering Anakin and leaving him by the lava, you have a really good reason for Anakin to go from a fallen Jedi to a hateful Sith. Maybe combine that instead of \"You killed Padme in your anger\", that the Jedi killed her, or Obi-Wan killed her. It doesn't have to be convincing to the viewer, but an angry, maimed, and betrayed Anakin takes little convincing. This cements his hatred.\n\nHe doesn't assault the Temple, then, because he fell after killing Windu, but because the failings of the Jedi Order, the loss of Padme and his children (ostensibly because of the Jedi), the betrayal of both the Jedi altogether and Obi-Wan specifically, and his final submission to Sidious and donning of his armor all combined to replace every single thing that was once Anakin Skywalker with Darth Vader, a killing machine driven by hatred and the Dark Side.\n\nBonus, it could also showcase how powerful the Dark Side is. Where Anakin Skywalker was a skilled, agile fighter who ultimately lost a lightsaber duel, Darth Vader is an unstoppable juggernaut who hardly struggles against many other trained Jedi Knights.",

Anakin got to the point he was through well-meaning negligence.  Yoda did not want to be responsible for what Anakin might become if the Jedi trained him and he fell to the dark side because of his age upon entry.  He gave into his compassion for Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and permitted it, but refused to probe into what troubles Anakin, despite being acutely aware that he was capable of murder and was hiding someone he felt attachment to.  These were ignored warning signs, because Yoda did not want to be involved with Anakin because everything he believed about being a Jedi and what they should be said not to.  But he was wrong.\n\nHe reflected on this in his years alone on Dagobah, realizing how wrong he\u2019d been, and stopped Luke from following the same mistakes he\u2019d made by holding onto the scriptures he\u2019d do dearly held to.  I didn\u2019t like the Last Jedi, but it got one scene perfectly.  Yoda and the Jedi\u2019s issues were not in concept, it was execution.  By being too rigid and closed-minded, problems insidiously festered that the Sith could exploit.  When he saw Luke could not let go of the scriptures, and of such a rigid concept of what a \u201cJedi is\u201d he got involved, intervened, and told him to go and be a Jedi his way.  Be \u201cA New Hope\u201d like you were before when you wouldn\u2019t listen to me.  My approval isn\u2019t the Jedi way.\n\nThis is the Yoda as we think of him, wise immortal sage, but even in Return of the Jedi, he was still having a hard time seeing that the pitfalls to be aware of were not things that should hold a Jedi back from acting on compassion.  They\u2019re at their worst, mistakes to learn from and grow from when you\u2019ve made them.  Anakin was accidentally taught that he should be ashamed of feeling so intensely and be shunned for his love for Padme, rather than that he should be aware that she could be used to manipulate him and he would make mistakes in trying to protect their best interests over others\u2019, etc.  That\u2019s because that\u2019s what the Grandmaster of the order had been teaching; love, attachment, is forbidden.",

When he discovered Palpatine was the Sith Lord they were searching for, it surely made so much more sense. Jedi were better than that. He'd been tricked by the Sith Lord. And yet, the moment Mace had that Sith Lord defeated in front of him, just as Anakin did, he said the same thing. It turned out that the Jedi are no different from the Sith. They're perfectly willing to kill helpless foes.\n\nThis is fantastic. I never really connected the two comments together before.",

Palpatine knew Yoda would be the one to go, and that removes a major obstacle. He also suggested Anakin go to take down Grievous knowing the Council would probably send Obi-Wan instead, eliminating another good influence.\n\nHe told Anakin he was a Sith Lord, probably not immediately expecting him to join him, but because he knew Anakin would go and report this to the Council. And who is the Council almost certainly going to send? Probably the guy who already dislikes Anakin and is the very embodiment of everything Anakin is frustrated with.",

The Council then intentionally *didn't* send Anakin.  They should have sent Mace, but Obi-Wan was also obviously a good choice given his success.  Whether they sent Obi-Wan or Made, success for Palpatine either way, because Palpatine almost certainly could have beaten Obi-Wan.\n\nIF Anakin AND Obi-Wan both went, they *possibly* may have beaten Palpatine, but given how their two-on-one with Dooku went, I find that unlikely.",

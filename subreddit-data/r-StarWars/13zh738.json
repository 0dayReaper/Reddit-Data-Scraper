Weird to love this scene I know but the combination of complete psychopath in Gorst totally enjoying the moment is so well done. This scene and his acting doesnt get enough credit\n\n\\- The scene between Saw and Luthen when Saw goes on and on about the different factions in the galaxy. \"*Kreegyr's a separatist. Maya Pei's a neo-Republican. The Ghorman front. The Partisan alliance. Sectorists. Human cultists. Galaxy partitionists\"*  I love that the galaxy is such a big place with so many factions and complexity, much like real life. Very far away from \"good vs evil\" of the original Star Wars.\n\n\\- The whole Mon Mothma - Davo Sculdum exchange. That scene is just perfection, from the Art Deco decor to the dialog, when is being said and not said , its just perfection\n\nAbsolutely love it, looking fw to Season 2",

That said, it's a symphony of social commentary playing off the interlink between cops / drug dealers / schools / politicians / the media and how they all feed each others' conflicts.  Similar to Andor, it takes a few episodes to build up to full speed so give it 5-6 episodes before you really decide whether you like it.  Season 1 is mostly cops vs drug dealers.  The symphony really gets going Seasons 3+",

I truly think at least one episode could\u2019ve been cut from this arc, without sacrificing anything the story. \n\nThat said, The Eye is the most beautiful of the Andor episodes.

Everyone\u2019s taste is just different too.  Shows like BCS  and many others are so much more well paced to me than Andor, and strike a better balance of slow pacing with big payoffs\n\nAll subjective though",

It feels far more grown up in its approach, a mature star wars akin to its parent Rogue One.  I have the Mandolorian for all my'Pew, pew' needs and Andor for the politics and the grim behind the scenes empire and the growing rebellion it truly is a refreshing change to what has been done with the Star Wars in the past. \n\n The politics at play in this show surpasses what we had for the Phantom Menance and it may well be down to the ability to allow room to flesh it all out instead of throwing it all at us in the first 10 minutes followed by scenes of people in a big hall shouting at one another.",

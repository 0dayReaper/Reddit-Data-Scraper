    "postText": "Sabine with a green saber in the Ahsoka trailer, presumably Ezras which chopper gave her at the end of s4, and we see her have on her belt in the empire magazine release, however it appears in the 10 or so years since the S4 Epilogue with short hair and saber on her belt, she's grown her hair out and added a new guard to the saber? Looks like Cal kestis style guard? Anyone else notice this?",

I\u2019m admittedly behind a bit on the material, but what source states that Cal\u2019s saber is definitively blue?

Since the sequel overrides the first game's customization to ensure you're using jaro's saber by default again, it's probably safe to say that's Cal's canonical saber of choice.\n\nThough he also still probably has quite the collection of crystals and parts.",

It wouldnt be possible to save transfer your custom blade because many of the old parts arent avaliable anymore.",

    "postText": "I'm writing my own story surrounding an already established character once thought to be dead around the time of ROTS. I've written a way for them to come back but I need to know a few things: did the Republic Medical Facility have a room dedicated to cryo-stasis? Also I remember hearing that one of two stations during the clone wars held these cryo tanks. I believe it was either the Ord Cestus Medical Station or the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center. Which station had cryo tanks and which station would house wounded jedi?",

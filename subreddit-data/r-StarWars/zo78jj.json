A shoto lightsaber is just a short lightsaber, usually for dual wielding. It would be carried in the off-hand and would be used to block incoming strikes like a fencing dagger. The small size meant it was easier to use and carry in the off-hand.\n\nLumiya's whip could wrap around a blocking saber, trapping it. Luke started using the shoto so that he could occupy the whip and still have a second saber free to strike back. So instead of trapping both her and Luke's weapon, Lumiya was just trapping her own.",

Not everyone followed the path of Caste Shai at all in the grand scheme of their conquest. But Ganner's last stand at the old Senate building that had turned into the cradle of the world brain creature was epic, and was such a strong and amazing transformation for that man and his character. I named a lot of my old online game alias after him, as there was no one who had gone through such an intense transformation with all the trauma of the war in such a short span and became one of the greatest Jedi in the NJO as a result. He became, truly, one with the Force.",

If you're a Jedi and you have already chosen to duel with a lightsaber against another force user with a lightsaber, you know the outcome is death for one of you more than likely. \n\nI mean hell, Windu was probably one of the best duelist in the universe, he was tapping into the dark-side for his form. If a Jedi decides to tap into the dark-side to win the fight, I doubt they would be against this kind of tactic if it helps them win, live, save other lives, etc. \n\nAnd yeah, if this worked, the Sith would for SURE use it all the time, their ultimate goal is to win and gain more power at all costs. I'm sure they don't like being seen as weak but they sure as hell like living and winning duels lol",

Lightsaber fights seem to be based on anticipation of where your opponent is going to strike and putting your blade in the way before their blade strikes you. It takes lots of focus to be in the moment and anticipate the next strike. Pulling a \u201cfast one\u201d by extinguishing your blade at the point of contact doesn\u2019t seem like a viable tactic against a focused Jedi/Sith. Plus it seems like it would be a waste of time in the heat of a duel. Extinguishing and reigniting your lightsaber feels time consuming in a fight and tactically, a terrible idea especially if their opponent successfully anticipates this.\n\nWhile I get the gist of the argument/humor in the video, the creators aren\u2019t doing an adequate job representing the flow of combat. The taller guy just stands there dumbfounded when the blades don\u2019t make contact and hold the blade in place long enough for the other guy to reignite his blade.",

            "comment": "* Energized plasma is relatively weightless, therefore the total apparent weight of a light saber is represented in the mass of the hilt.\n* Swinging a saber would not require swinging from the shoulder or require large power moves.\n* Most saber strikes would originate from movement of the wrist, using a sort of flicking motion.\n* The saber is the only thing between the duelist and their opponent, and would always be kept oriented forward at all times, toward the opponent, not their weapon.\n* Saber duels in media, including the video presented here, always depict saber wielders striking for each other's weapon. In reality, nobody swings at another fighter's weapon (or shield.) All strikes are aimed at the body, head or limbs of the opponent.\n* Due to the preceding point, defensive moves are not actually aimed at the opposing weapon, but placed in defense of exposed target areas while remaining oriented toward the enemy swordsman.\n* If the saber blade had mass (it doesn't, unless it's got some kind of magical Dark Saber properties,) then a parrying move would confer momentum to the wielder.\n* Light sabers should bounce off each other (or simply slide apart,) and not be capable of allowing duelists to become clinched in a bind (unless *Star Wars* has some kind of undisclosed static friction effect at work, which is possible.)\n\nWhat this means is that if you try this turning your blade off bullshit, then one of three situations occur:\n\n1. (without mass) You turn off your blade like a smart guy, and your opponent effortlessly flicks their weapon into your face, turning a parrying move into a devastating back strike before you can re-ignite your own weapon. Result? You're dead or seriously injured and probably incapable of continuing the fight.\n2. (with mass) You turn off your blade and the momentum of the opposing saber carries it into your exposed body. Result? You're either dead or seriously injured and probably incapable of continuing the fight.\n3. (in the bind) As noted before, this shouldn't possible but we will assume that the, \"rule of cool,\" allows it somehow. You come into a close-order bind with your enemy, standing nearly toe-to-toe. You turn off your blade in an attempt to bypass the bind and complete your strike. The opposing blade (without mass) is now instantly flicked into your face, or (with mass) carried forward into your face by the now released energy imparted to it by your opponent as they pushed toward you in the bind. Result? You're either dead or seriously injured and probably incapable of continuing the fight.\n\nNobody in their right mind would ever turn off their blade during a fight unless there was enough space between opponents that it could be safely re-ignited in time to meet a sudden enemy attempt to close the distance. There is no requirement for this move to be forbidden or frowned upon by tradition. Common sense and self-preservation would prevent saber wielders from doing anything as stupid as this bullshit.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

            "comment": "No, this wouldnt work, outside of a few niche moments where it got someone an advantage once a century. \n\n1) People DONT aim at each others blades when fighting. Ideally (and jedi are the best blademasters in the galaxy), each of your moves - be that an attack or parry, is also threatening your opponent. Meaning that the parry you see on the video would most likely be aimed at the attacker as well as deflecting the blade, giving the guy defending an easy win. This is even confirmed by ep1 choreography instructors, who tried to make it seem like every move was also a check mate. \n\n\n2) Double-kills / Kill-suicides. By using the move on the video, you are letting the opponents blade uncontested for a chance to strike. Not only can the opponent get you BEFORE you even land said strike (stabs are insanely quick), but they can also get you DURING your strike and even AFTER. And while your blade is down, his is already in position for a strike from a parry position you baited him in. This means that even if you execute this move in the best possible situation, you are still dead, and lost. (And if you survive and win, you could have probably used a million other techniques instead, so it wasnt really thanks to this)\n\n\n3) Tempo. If you are making a move, the opponent is also making one. They are not there to react so you can do fancy stuff, they are there to fight. He will be putting pressure on you, forcing you to react as much as you are forcing him. Add the fact that jedi can team up with the force, to basically see the moves before they even happen. This all means that there will be little chances to even use this in a real fight, let alone at the perfect time and correctly, without commiting suicide. \n\n\n4) Distance and time. So lets say you are not fighting yet and the enemy gives you the first strike. Since most lightsabers are the same, your striking ranges will be the same as his, forcing you to enter his range so you can do anything. After you get in range, you decide to sabotage your strike via turning your saber off, which \"retracts\" it. The closer to your hands the enemy decides to parry, the more time you will have to wait WHILE OPEN to do your thing. After your saber is past the opponents blade, then you can turn it on again... And this is where is really sucks. Either you are near the limit of each others range, meaning you will have to wait and pray to the force that you land and kill before he does anything, OR you moved closer, where HIS SABER might already be since the parry, prepared for you to impale yourself if you come closer... or you are somehow lucky enough to get past, only to enter the grappling range. If you still didnt change your mind at this point and are not moving to get yourself into a better position, the opponent is already reacting and you better hope he wont start grappling when you overextended yourself so much. Now you might say \"but my saber is longer than his!\" Well, when you can threaten someone in a range where he cant threaten you, why ever would you go for a risky, slow manuever? \n\n\n5) Predictability and counters. While most jedi/sith/people with lightsabers probably thought of doing this before (meaning its known), the technique was hardly ever used even inside canon. Really, if it was so powerful, wouldnt everyone who could use it? If everyone used it, it would quickly result in mass double-kill suicides, forcing everyone to create counters. As we dont see this technique pretty much ever, we can assume that even in cannon, its either useless, or has been eclipsed by an easy counter. Thats because... people dont want to die and WILL use the best tools and techniques they can to protect themselves. \n\n\nI really see this technique as just a meme. Its weak, slow and sabotages your defences. Pretty much the pinnacle of \"I want to end this guy SOOO rightly I will defeat him with something he would be ashamed of\" kinda deal.",

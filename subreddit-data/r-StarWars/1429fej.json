I'm fine until that specific scene, but as soon as I see that tear rolling down his face, I'm a sobbing mess.  \n\nThe worst part is, now I've watched it too many times and wallowed in the sadness for too long, I've come to realise that... she killed them through her choices, just as surely as if she'd cut them down personally. Not deliberately, of course, but in the end it worked out the same. \n\nMy logic is this: We've seen what Ahsoka can do when she's in danger. She's a powerhouse. She could have gotten off that ship easily... if she'd left Rex behind. Having him with her forced her to slow down and expose herself. I mean, I get it, I love Rex and I'm not sure I could have left him behind either, but the ship only crashed because she set Maul free to create a distraction, which she only really needed because she wanted time to remove Rex's chip. If she'd left him and focused on escaping, the ship would have been fine, everyone would have lived - except Maul - and she could have come back to save Rex later on. That entire ship full of people died because she refused to leave without her friend. \n\nThat's the tough part for me. She couldn't know that he'd be fine if she left without him, and she cared about him enough that she felt like she couldn't just leave him behind, but in doing so she set in motion actions that resulted in the deaths of everyone. Poor Ahsoka. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. Those episodes are beautiful and awful and really a work of art. Holy moly, the FEELS!  So intense! Also, the cinematography of Season 7 in general was just such a step up from the first six seasons. Like, that scene right at the end where the ship is starting to break up in the atmosphere, and Rex has managed to find that little ship, while Ahsoka's trying to leap through the falling rubble to reach it?  Beautiful.  Just beautiful.  Her fight with Maul was gorgeous, too.  Just goes to show the difference that ten years of technology (and presumably experience) make to a show.",

From a utilitarian perspective (the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few) you're right, but Star Wars has already budged hard against utilitarian (by showing that sending a few troopers into certain death to save a whole is *bad*). \n\nAdmittedly Ahsoka letting Maul go free when she values life (and knows Maul **will** leave behind a trail of bodies) is a bit of a *because plot* reasoning.\n\nAhsoka was adhering to her morality, which is a morality of agency. A morality that says that violating someone's choice/agency is morally wrong. Rex *chose* to stay with Ahsoka. Ahsoka *chose* not to kill the clones. The clones aren't *choosing* to kill Ahsoka, they're being forced to, so ending them for that would be *wrong*. Additionally, If Ahsoka left Rex or didn't respect Rex's choice to accompany her, she'd feel that was a morally wrong choice, because she'd be violating his agency.",

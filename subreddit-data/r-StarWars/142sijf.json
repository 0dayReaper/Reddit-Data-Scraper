It barrels along at such a pace - particularly the first 40 minutes are a total joy.\n\nWhilst I loved Andor, and enjoyed the bits of Mandalorian, I really miss this joyous, wonder-filled sort of Star Wars. Not lengthy, bogged down, serious or pondorous like Andor or Mando, but full of light-footed adventure, wide-eyed dreamers, over-the-top villains and loveable rogues.\n\nI hope future movies can capture this unique tone again - I think it's my favourite thing about Star Wars, and why I never liked the Prequels all that much.\n\nAnyone with me?",

We\u2019re the ones that are trying to grasp to these childhood feelings of magic and fun. We\u2019re the ones who have taken this thing to an extreme. Star Wars, by and large, is doing what it\u2019s always done - telling stories for the newest generations. \n\nI\u2019m not saying fandom is bad. I\u2019m a fan. I\u2019ve been a fan for 25 years now. But I think as I get further into my fandom that I try to keep things in perspective. I get the urge to jump to certain conclusions when there\u2019s something I dislike, it happens to me all the time. But I always try to remind myself that Star Wars isn\u2019t for me, I\u2019m not the target audience anymore. And that\u2019s depressing in a certain way, but it\u2019s the way its supposed to be.",

They might be travelling to different planets, but for most of the movie they look...bored by it all.\n\nPlus there's Jar Jar stinking everything out.\n\nIt might have been inventive, bold creatively, dedicated to its lore,\n\nbut seriously, a romp it ain't. It doesnt even have a lead character!",

Star Wars used to have a subtle and natural humor where laughs came with the situation: see most C3PO scenes. I didn't like them making Finn a character that was just weird: see his scene with Han in Starkiller base where he points out Rey and he does that goofy head nodding thing, or when he tries to convince Rey he's in the resistance, or his \"I'm in charge now\" scene. They just didn't feel like they fit in Star Wars. Maybe a Marvel movie, but not Star Wars. It just felt like they were trying too hard to get a laugh.",

I love his constant befuddlement - he spends the whole movie learning how to be anything other than a storm-trooper: he's like a teenager suddenly set free. When he and Po meet on the Star Destroyer and Poe says \"we're going this\", Boyega's expression is pure movie-star.\n\nFor me, the comedy lands - in large part thanks to Boyega's performance. But I can see where you're coming from.\n\nSpeaking of C3P0, him interrupting Leia and Han's reunion in TFA is brilliant",

A big part of the problem with the sequels is they're trying to be everything. They want to be fun light hearted romps, dark serious explorations of the characters and their dark sides, silly comedies, gritty depictions of war, and so much more. It's just too fucking much. TFA is the least egregious in this regard, as it's more focused on capturing a tone that's more in line with episode 4 and 6, but as it goes on it just keeps throwing in more until you get to episode 9 and you genuinely can't tell if it was intended to be one movie because it's so overstuffed that you could swear it was like 4 hours long.",

Thankfully, I can say I'm not with the crowd that was mostly just pissed there were women in the movie, but that's beside the point. If the trilogy was going to have any hope of sticking the landing, it had to take what TLJ didn't throw out and build from it. Instead, they shook the franchise like an etch-a-sketch and hoped they could somehow establish 3 movies worth of plot and character development during the runtime of the last movie in that trilogy. A basic story outline would've made this trilogy at least coherent, but as it stands, it's all over the damn place. 7 is basically jumping up and down saying, 'The old movies were great, weren't they?' Then 8 comes along and goes 'but maybe we should do *something* new?' Then there's 9 that loudly proclaims, 'shut up 8 you don't know dick, anyway here's Palpatine back from playing some fortnight where he's been the entire time lol.' Disney paid 4 billion dollars just to have the opportunity to make this? Who the fuck was running this shit, Goofy?",

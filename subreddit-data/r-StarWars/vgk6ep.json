When I saw those helmets on the sticks I knew exactly what the fuck was going on, and it brought back memories of my dad's generation talking about Vietnam. The end of S7 is, without exception, the absolute best there is, in the entire SW canon. Everything builds to this moment. It is told in almost total silence, at least only sounds and no speech. There's nothing the characters could say that would not cheapen the scene, and rob it of its impact.\n\nHe refuses to rewatch the end of S5 unless he steels himself for it.",

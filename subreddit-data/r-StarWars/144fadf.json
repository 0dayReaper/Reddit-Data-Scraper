We'll be getting Mando S4, Bad Bad Season 3, The Acoylte, Skeleton Crew for TV sometime in the future. Ahsoka premieres in August. They just announced the premiere date yesterday. \n\nThey also announced 3 films in April - a film about Rey's New Jedi Order, James Mangold making a film about the first Jedi, and Filoni's New Republic-Imperial Remnant conflict film.",

Untitled Movie set long before the PT directed by James Mangold\n5.  Untitled Rey Jedi Order movie directed by Obaid Shaneen Chinoy\n6.  Untitled Rian Johnson movie/trilogy\n\nIt's worth noting that the Rogue Squadron and the Rian Johnson projects are, as likely as not, just not happening.  So even though they were announced and never officially cancelled.  A lot of fans treat them like they were cancelled.\n\nAnd given that track record, I wouldn't be surprised if some of these other projects end up with the same fate.\n\nBasically, you should take Lucasfilm movie announcements with a grain of salt.",

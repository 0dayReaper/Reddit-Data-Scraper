    "postText": "They are sitting on literal mountains of material, great storylines, and epic jedi-sith wars. The intrigue and infighting of the Sith alone would be a really enjoyable storyline, not even mentoining characters like Revan, Malak, Vitiate, etc. Or Bane for example.\n\nThey have so much lore that they already could have built a start for an MCU like movie universe in that timeline. Not that I would like that way of execution for SW, but they have so much content and potential that with a little bit of planning we already should be in the end of a thoretical first phase. Or better, at the middle of a brand new trilogy.\n\nIf done well, we could get a new and fresh live-action era that could be the future of Star Wars. Instead of that, they are developing projects like a Rey film\u2026 The only 2 thing that keeps me excited are The Acolyte and the story about the first jedi, and even for those we had to wait 10 years. In the next 5 years, I\u2019m almost sure we won\u2019t see anything related to Revan or other iconic characters.\n\nLive-action Old Republic content should have already been in the theaters, or at least on Disney+. In terms of missed opportunity, the fact that Old Republic content still hasn\u2019t arrived is absolutely on par with the mishandled sequel trilogy.",

That could be a very promising \u201cjumping off point\u201d for old republic stuff that is set a bit later but still way before the current stuff. This new film could give us a taste of what the ancient galaxy was like and give future creatives some more perspective on where to go with the Old Republic setting.",

IMO the correct way would be to intruduce a new era to milk that one with actual quality products, and I just don\u2019t understand why won\u2019t they do Old Republic when it has infinite potential.",

Retrospectively, they rarely inspired from the EU, and when they do, it\u2019s a toss up if they chose from the right content (Thrawn) or from the wrong (Palpatine clone lmao)\n\nOn the quality part tho, I completely agree with you at the end of the day. With the way they are handling things, they could even butcher the Old Republic stories.. It\u2019s just sad, we could get so many wonderful content.",

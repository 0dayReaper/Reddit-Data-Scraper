            "comment": "Star Wars has been political since 1977. The second thing we learn (after that the story takes place \u201ca long time ago\u201d and \u201cfar, far away\u201d) is that \u201cIt is a period of Civil War.\u201d\n\nPolitics is and always has been part of the story. It\u2019s only recently that agitators arguing in bad faith say shit like \u201cKeep politics out of my entertainment!\u201d",

The ST writers were not. The only real political theme the ST ran with was one scene about arms dealers playing both sides.\n\nAnd let's not forget Star Trek only recently \"going political\" when there was literally a DS9 episode where O'Brien handed Rom the writings of Karl Marx. So if anything, it's been shifted too far to the right from when it was openly criticizing capitalism on prime time TV.",

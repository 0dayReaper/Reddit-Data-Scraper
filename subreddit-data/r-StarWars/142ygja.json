    "postText": "After all the hype about Andor I figured I'd watch it and was very excited. However after the whole season I find myself wondering what all the hype was about. I never cared about the lady with money problems, I honestly never cared about Andor. He's unlikable and unimportant. Axis was very well acted and the show should have been about him. \n\nStar wars shows don't have to be campy and funny to be star wars but this was just uninteresting. \n\nIt was no where near Mando of any season. Idk was just underwhelmed waited for something to happen that never did.",

She's the leader of the Rebel Alliance first seen in Return of The Jedi. The actress who plays her now was first featured in deleted scenes from Revenge of The Sith,  and later (looking more like her ROTJ days) in Rogue One.\n\nAnyway, I found her story extremely interesting.",

Not just little things here and there that go unnoticed, but to \u201cfight these bastards for real.\u201d\n\n\u2014To Mon Mothma, Luthen explained that he is trying to do enough harm to the Empire that they crack down in force, causing regular citizens to suffer. It is only in that suffering that regular people will rise up against The Empire and fight back. \n\n\u2014To Saw, Luthen explained that he\u2019s trying to bring the various independent cells of rebel activity together to fight as a unified organization. He\u2019s concerned that if they wait too much longer it will be too late. \n\n\u2014To Lonni, Luthen explained that he has come to the realization that he must use the tactics of his enemy\u2014The Empire\u2014against them, and in doing so becomes just as bad as they are; that he is \u201cdamned\u201d for what he does, and that he\u2019ll likely never see the fruits of his sacrifice. \n\nLuthen is a classic \u201caccelerationist\u201d\u2014one who amplifies pressure and tension and overt subversive behavior to rapidly bring about desired change. \n\nTry putting your phone down as you watch\u2026 it does wonders for comprehending what\u2019s going on in a show.",

The reason his arrest is for an unrelated crime is because a major theme of the show (and of Star Wars in general) is that the Empire is arrogant and complacent and that causes its undoing. It demonstrated to Cass that the Empire will crush him even if he tries to run, which is what ends up radicalising him in prison. The robbery also stirs up tension on Ferrix (leading to to Maarva staying rather than leaving with Cassian, causing her to die and him to not see her again), emboldens Mon Mothma to start being more active, and gives Meera the resources and access she needs to follow her leads.\n\nNothing meaningful.",

That hook comes in the third episode when things start to kick off and we get a sense of where the story is going, so I'd say if you get to the end of episode 3 and you're still not feeling it, then this show probably isn't going to be your thing.",

Even the action was atrociously boring and impractical. \n\nWe didn't need to see mon mothma and her rich white people rebellion \"perhaps my politics are extreme\" as she spends 10 episodes just tossing money at problems like a real world liberal with no actual conviction. \n\nWe didn't need to see an anti tractor beam weapon that's so advanced nobody had it, even though it's really just opening the spare parts compartment. \n\nWe didn't need ten minutes Luthan getting into the character of a gay art dealer. \n\nWe didn't need \"once the bells stop... You're in trouble\" and then nothing happens. \n\nThey took the least interesting character from rogue one and gave it a show full of pastiches.",

The story is just too slow and Andor barely do anything just starring in the distance. I don't understand the hype either while there's other interesting series. Even Boba Fett was better, Andor and Boba Fett have the same story length but Andor got around 5 hours more. The fact that Andor will get another 12 parts while other important characters got nothing is a bit unfair imo.",

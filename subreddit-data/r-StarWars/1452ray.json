Outside of that, there is no practical or symbolic difference between a yellow, green, blue, or purple lightsaber. Hell, *Luke* had a yellow saber for a [while](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker's_yellow_lightsaber) in canon.\n\nIt is true that yellow was most commonly used by the Jedi temple guards in *The Clone Wars*, but it was by no means exclusive to them.\n\nAnd no, grey Jedi are not a thing.",

Qui gon for example would not call himself such, as he is merely a member of the Jedi order. \n\nTL;DR it\u2019s a term some writers tried to make work a few years back but the Powers That Be have said \u201cno that\u2019s poppycock\u201d.",

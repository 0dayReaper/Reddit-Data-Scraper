It then looks like he's with the Tuskens for like a couple of weeks, but that doesn't make sense because he leaves them and walks directly into the timeline of *The Mandalorian* so he must have stayed with the Tuskens for like five years. Or he aimlessly wandered the Dune Sea for five years, but that would be impossible to survive and it's not like he wouldn't have found a city again fairly quickly.",

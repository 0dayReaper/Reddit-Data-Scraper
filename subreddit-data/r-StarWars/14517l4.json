Originally, the writers and staff planned to thank JPL for assisting in the graphics, but it was changed to the specific programmers' names after one of the programmers, Mike Plesset, pointed out that JPL didn't even know their computers had been used.\n\nhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Star_plans/Legends",

This is because in the early drafts for\u00a0A New Hope, the superlaser was intended to be situated on the center of the equatorial trench, but was then repositioned to the station's \"northern hemisphere.\" However, the film crew forgot to notify Cuba and Imhoff [the computer graphic artists] to make the same change to their own designs, thus creating an on-screen blooper.",

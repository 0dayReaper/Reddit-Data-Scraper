The YouTube version is low quality, but I just re-watched the scene on D+ and he's clearly a small child. Or he literally more than doubled in height in three years.\n\nAlso, even if he was a 16 year old dwarf who magically became normal height, how many 16 year olds come running when their aunt calls? At 16, I ran for gym class or to catch up with friends, anyone else was getting a slow walk at best. 12 and under though, they've got more energy than an exploding star. When aren't they running?\n\nIt's a lot more likely rebels made a minor continuity error here.",

Given how involved he is with Saw's Partisans, it would be hard to justify him not joining the Rebellion after Yavin, if he were alive. Question is how he dies or who kills him. I'm hoping the story goes full tragedy and he falls to the dark side.",

He's killed more sentients than any Jedi since probably the Old Republic wars with the Sith or Mandolorians (since the Clone Wars were mostly against droids), he's got a dark side girlfriend that is going to challenge the taboo, and he has so many people he wants to protect and an empire to fight. Just from a gameplay perspective, the dark side force powers would provide a bunch of new skills to learn. Exploring ruins is totally his jam so I could totally see him exploring Korriban and being taught by some Sith ghosts or another ancient Sith world. It would also mean one less Jedi who needs to be explained out of the original trilogy. There could be a post game bonus level with a time skip and you play as Ahsoka and have to fight a fallen Cal Kestis.",

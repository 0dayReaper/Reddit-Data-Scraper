    "postText": "So coming off ROTJ, The galaxy is in relative peace. The rebels took down the Empire, the 2nd death star, obliterated them. Vader's redeemed, the Emperor dead. Yes there are stragglers and remnants of the Empire, but they are hunted down and assumibly eliminated. And all our characters are resolved.\n\n\nI'm thinking like 30-40 years later, I feel like an eventual civil war in some capacity would make for a really interesting sequel trilogy that would then potentially make it easier for an 10,11,12 to flow into. Do the whole 'Luke makes a new Jedi order,.and Leia and Han have a baby. Etc.' But if we think about where the Galaxy is, really the only thing that could rock them reasonably would be from within.\n\n\nSo this could make for really cool ideas of divisiveness and crumbling and thus Luke and the new Jedi order would have to battle with their need for control to maintain order as this entire new Galactic system collapses from within, and how to learn to trust the Force during this process.\nIn this way, enemies wouldn't just pop out of the blue for the sake of having a bad guy, the \"bad guy\" could be familiar faces as sides are plotted against each other. Similar to the American Civil War how a nation of new birth and relative freedom and peace almost now crumbled from within.\n\n\nI'd love for people to expand on this if they're up for it or have other ideas on what could happen\n\n\nTL;DR : I basically think there could be really cool Sequels plot lines and stories to be told out of a Galactic Civil War.",

            "comment": "Tbh, I like this in general, but a galaxy where the government is constantly at war sounds a bit repetitive. Like theres not even any period of peace, this civil war throws them into a similar government-wide war again. The American Civil War was fought over slavery, correct? Oppression. The rebels just fought their war in ep 4-6 over the empire\u2019s oppression, i\u2019m assuming this civil war would also have to be fought over some sort of oppression? Can ep 7-9 be about something different?\n\nI think the civil war arc may work better in ep 10, 11, 12.",

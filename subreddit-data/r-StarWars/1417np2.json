Fuzzy brain from sorting lego all day. \n\nSpoilers for season 2 of Rebels &amp; the Kenobi series.\n\nNot sure if this has been pointed out before:\n\nAt the end S02E02 Vader is talking to the emperor and implies he has not located Obi-wan and that they presumes he might be dead. Rebels take place 10ish years after the Kenobi series, in which Vader and Obi-Wan meet again and clearly recognise each other.",

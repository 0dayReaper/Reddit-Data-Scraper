And if those hookers get pregnant, we come by with the recruiters to harvest the results. As long as you fuck and leave, having no contact with the hookers or the bastard offspring, it's a win for us.\n\nFemale/carrying Jedi? Oof. They won't mind the Zeltron rentboy as long as you don't catch feelings (remember to hit AND quit) and as long as you don't get pregnant.  Pregnancy will be handled as a shameful intersection at best.  You will be locked in a medcenter, give birth, then give the kid away (pretending it never existed) and never see them again like an old \"unwed mother's home.\" (Satele Shan) Or you will be exiled, and still forced to give up the kid and never see them again (Arren Kae)\n\nRemember kids - fuck and leave is good. Violence and killing for the State is good. But Attachment Bad!\n\n(Yeah, Lucas was not thinking this all the way through)",

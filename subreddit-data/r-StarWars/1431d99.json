For the most part there is no grand over arching plot that depends on seeing every episode. Yeah the characters develop and go through their arcs but you can skip a series of episodes if they aren't your liking. It's just a bunch of adventures. \n\nI'm sure if you Google it you can find someone's chart on reddit that says which episodes are must sees or which ones go with which character or just look at IMDb and watch the ones that are rated the highest. Don't feel like you can't enjoy it if you don't do the grind of watching every episode.",

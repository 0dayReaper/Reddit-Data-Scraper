    "postText": "Been having a debate on the colour of anakins robes from RotS with a mate and we can't decide what colour they are at all. We know he's got a nice black leather vest, the robes under that though we can't tell, we've watches the film a few times and look at loads of stills and it ranges from brown, dark brown, very dark brown and black.\n\nWhat colour are his robes?!",

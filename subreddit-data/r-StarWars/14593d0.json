            "comment": "Darth Bane didn't kill most the other Sith, Lord Kaan did - sort of. Bane tricked him into unleashing a Force ritual of the ancient Sith, called a \"mind bomb\" (yes, very creative), in which most of the remaining Dark Lords participated. (a few, like Kopecz, didn't want to participate but died in battle the same day) So yes, Darth Bane was the only (former) Dark Lord of the Sith of Kaans Brotherhood. There may have been some surviving force sensitive soldiers or Sith assassins but no other \"Dark Lords\".\n\nOnly a fraction of the Jedi was present on Ruusan, because, unlike in the Clone Wars, a large part of the Order didn't want to go down the military path, even though their enemies were Sith. 100 of the Jedi on Ruusan - mainly the \"Jedi Soldiers\" serving under General Hoth - died alongside the Sith by sacrificing themselves to Kaan and his mind bomb.",

            "comment": "TBH, the sword naming is more or less artificial tradition, usually the names of the swords have little connection to what they actually do. And when they do, it's usually turns out something mundane, like when you trace the Excalibur name back to whatver black magic spell it was called in Welsh, it ultimately boils down to \"great cutter\" or something to that effect. \n\nThis especially would be odd considering the process of creating a lightsaber, since you make one as an extension of yourself and completing it is a capstone on your skill, proof that you are a Jedi in many respects. Well, at least that what it used to be in ye'olde times, Prequel younglings just have all pieced handed to them, those whippersnappers. Getting everything easy. \n\nSo I don't think there's a large incentive to come up with some sort of special name for a lightsaber. That said, I can imagine a scene like:\n\n\"And as the first sun broke it's rays over the dunes, Luke ignited his weapon. As he stared in the emerald blade he steeled his resolve, and gave it a name Hruk'malad, The Emerald Dawn. In hutteese.\"\n\nYou have to name them in different language, or it wouldn't sound cool, and Luke is fluent in hutteese, being a Tattoine native of course.",

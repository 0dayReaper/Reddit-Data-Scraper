If Dooku has already turned but wasn\u2019t quite in Sidious\u2019s pocket at the time of the Clone Wars, and Qui-Gon survives to teach Anakin, he very well may have stayed good and he may have swayed Dooku back to the Light as well. Qui-Gon was always going against the Jedi Order because he knew this as Dooku did - he was just committed to the ideals that the Order stood for, not what they currently represented. Qui-Gon, despite being stubborn towards the Council, was beloved by everyone on it for his brutal honesty and effectiveness in his missions. Sidious no doubt saw this as a threat and sent Maul on a suicide mission to at the very least kill Qui-Gon, if not both Jedi present on Naboo.",

Maul 100% would have gotten rid of Obi-Wan had he not started \u201cplaying with his food\u201d and toying with Obi-Wan at the end. Had he chucked both sabers down the shaft, or Force Pushed Obi-Wan down after he kicked him, he would have won. His aggressive, and cocky nature (to me) was definitely his undoing and what separates him from what I see an actual Sith apprentice like Dooku.",

Like a guy who Force-lightnings the shit out of someone antagonizing some innocent people, or Force-chokes someone about to set off a bomb.\n\nWhat I would give for a show like the Mandalorian but with a morally ambiguous \"Jedi\".",

He had all the underpinnings to make a phenomenal and philosophically complex villain throughout the prequel trilogy, but he\u2019s introduced within the last like 30 minutes of his first movie and killed off in the first 20 minutes of the next one. So much lost potential.",

They can meet him in Coruscant but there's no need to reveal him as the Big Bad until Episode II.\n\nOf course, we could just drop Dooku entirely and get more mileage out of Maul for two/three movies.\n\nHonestly, there was so much great material in the prequels.  Too much.  There could have been an incredible trilogy there if it was tightened up with fewer characters and more of the characters we keep.",

Or rather, it was Yoda as he might have been, or could yet become: a Yoda gone rotten, a Yoda whose awesome powers had been utterly unleashed by his connection to the dark side. In a flash Dooku saw how foolish he had been, trying to urge the old Master to the dark side. If Yoda ever turned that way, Sidious himself would be annihilated. The universe had yet to comprehend the kind of evil that a Jedi Knight of nearly nine hundred years could wield.\"",

I was under the impression that the Clone Wars was the first galactic conflict in generations, which is why they don\u2019t have an army and seem utterly caught off guard by it (and why they\u2019re so complacent). \n\nAlso, Tatooine wasn\u2019t under Republic jurisdiction. I\u2019m not sure we can blame the Jedi for the existence of slavery on a planet they have nothing to do with. Was slavery even legal in Republic territory? Granted, the underworld of Coruscant seems sufficiently shitty that the Jedi can be criticised for letting that fester under their noses. \n\nFinally, and this is a bit of a separate question, it\u2019s never really been clear to me what the role of the Jedi actually is in the Republic. They don\u2019t seem to wield political power or make policy decisions, but they kind of run the military. They\u2019re often described as \u2018peacekeepers\u2019, so they\u2019re also cops/detectives in a sense. This novel almost frames Yoda as a figure of equivalent standing to the Chancellor, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really true.",

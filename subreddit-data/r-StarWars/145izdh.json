    "postText": "Which one comes first. I just finished Solo. I have watched everthing up to that point in timeline order. But don't know if I should watch a jedi survivor \"movie\" or watch obi-wan next. \n\nI'm also curious about Andor (I have not watched Andor so i'm looking forward to this) and Rebels as I know they take place about the same time. When should I watch both series? Any help would be appreciated. ",

In Andor, The episodes take place almost immediately after one another, while Rebels is more stretched out, Season 1 starts that same year. I don\u2019t know which comes first, but I\u2019d personally recommend you start with Andor, since it dabbles more in the \u201cuniting the Rebel cells\u201d theme that shows up much later in Rebels",

But nothing is stated to be fact. All we know is it takes place on the same year. So it\u2019s a 50/50 shot at it being before or after.",

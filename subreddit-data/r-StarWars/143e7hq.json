Don't understand the decision to more than double the size of all the heavy cruisers after smaller ships had proven so invaluable during the galactic rebellion.\n\n The Resurgent especially feels like a kid designing his superhero and being like I want superman (ISD2) but stronger in every conceivable way. \n\nThe designs themselves looked amazing, though. And as a home base for the entire faction, I can actually accept it in the case of the Supremacy.",

They should have used the Resurgent more in the role of a Mandator/ allegiance (big fleet killing Battlecruiser) and then had a couple more specialized ships. An upgraded Acclimator for landing troops and then a Victory/ Nebula class style light Destroyer to make up the bulk of the fleet/ your main force multiplier. \n\nIt would show the First Order learning from the empires mistakes/ overreliance on a single model. Using their ISD upgrade Resurgent as the capital ship/ fleet killing weapon it should be and then surrounding it with a versatile fleet of specialized ships.",

Like out of the 10,000 planets you couldnt find some more ships sympathetic to the cause to have in your fleet. Star Wars Directors dont understand the scale of Star Wars in it\u2019s entirety. Corelia itself had hundreds of Capital ships themselves just for 1 planet. Make it make sense",

And ground invasions would be so massive undertakings that they would be hard to even bring to the screen. Even with a easy 3% mustering rate a smaller core planet with 1 billion inhabitants would have 30 million soldiers. To conquer that you would probably need at least 3 times that many soldiers which means millions of transport ships.\n\nAnd planets would not only have one ion cannon, they would have several hundred.",

Unless the planet is dependent on imports which can be blocked of.\n\nOrbital bombardment in SW is mostly done by lasers but they work in two directions. When the turbolaser of a star destroyer or equivalent can shoot down onto the planet, the same type of turbolaser can shoot up and hit the star destroyer.  \nAnd a planet can have a lot of turbolaser batteries and heavier emplacements like the Hoth ion cannon spread around its surface. Being anywhere close to the planet where it would be able to support a ground invasion would be very dangerous for a starship.",

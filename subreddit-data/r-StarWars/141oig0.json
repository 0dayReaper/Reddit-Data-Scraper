    "postText": "I know there was a comic about this concept (I forgot the name)\n\nBut having a TV show following a genuinely weak Jedi, only able to like force pull an apple or see 0.2 seconds into the future (weak Jedi precognition) and seeing him/her leverage those minute abilities to out smart and out wit inquisitors who are far more powerful (both in dueling and force abilities) would be cool. \n\nCal from fallen order doesn't really count imo, dude's a prodigy. Maybe this weaker Jedi is forced to use blasters with the force. Maybe setting up traps that can be hidden easily and quickly set up because to activate it only requires a weak force pull. (no need for levers and triggers and ropes.)",

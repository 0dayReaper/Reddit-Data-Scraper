He is momentarily excited that he finally understood a reference.",

No way it was because of something that happened 40 years ago, especially when he was welcome for a time. I think it was just because all his panel and press anecdotes were just salty about not being used as the voice, or face, and that most of ROTJ performance went to the stunt man who played Vader for saber fights (which might have been because of his spoiling ESB prior). It seemed like he burnt the bridge himself a few times over.",

Basically, David Prowse had a bit of a problem with letting major plot points out to the press, either intentionally or accidentally, which lead to George Lucas cutting Prowse out of a lot of RotJ and casting Sebastian Shaw as Anakin. In 2010 he was banned from participating in any official Star Wars events because of his appearance in *The People vs George Lucas*.",

No one but James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, Irvin Kirshner and Lucas actually knew what James' line would be in the finish film until it hit theaters, and Mark wasn't told until minutes before filming the scene.\n\nWhat Prowse actually did leak, was not only had \"Star Wars 2\" started fliming in 1979, for release in 1980, but that \"Star Wars 3\" was also going to be a thing.\n\nBut yeah, the bad blood started when he was dubbed over in the original film without any knowledge of it until the film was in theaters. Then it was compounded with taking him out of the suit for the action sequences in Empire, and eternally cemented when they promised him royalties for Jedi, and then made sure the film never earned a profit.",

He was doing a signing at a local comic shop before Star Wars Weekends and I convinced my friend and his mom to take us. We get there and Mr Bulloch isn't at the table, so we walk around the shop some. I see a Boba Fett action figure I want, seeing as though I'm about to meet Boba Fett, and not having brought extra money, begin to beg my friend's mom to get it for me. From nowhere, we hear \"Don't give in. Don't give into the Dark Side!\" Mr. Bulloch was hiding in the other isle listening to our conversation. He comes around and talks to us and about how the action figure I was asking about is actually one of his favorites and wasn't in production anymore. We talked a bit, and even though it was past his signing time, he was gracious enough to still sign for me and my friend. I had done a custom piece of paper that featured a painting he had commissioned of Boba surfing on Carbonite, and Mr. Bulloch got so excited that someone had found a picture of his painting.  \n\n\nI ended up with a great memory and, of course, a Boba Fett action figure which to this day is one of the few collectable toys I refuse to take out of its package.  \n\n\nRIP Jeremy Bulloch.",

Mostly because I got worked up because his figure never appeared in the toy store and it was so cool, I just had to get it. I don't know why it was so rare (same for Snowtrooper, Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo) but one day, hooboi, we were in town and of course I wanted to have a look in the toy store.. and there he was. My parents knew my pain so I got it without further ado. I was so happy and giddy! \n\nLater he remained my favourite in the movies too because he was so cool-looking and I suppose his few scenes helped (despite wishing he was much more in them). \n\nBy the time AOTC was released I had become a grognard and didn't like at all that Lucas used him the way he did; wouldn't mind if Fett was in it as the character he was in the OT but making him this grumpy kid and brother to millions of troopers was something I couldn't get behind. Fortunately it didn't really mar my love for the \"original\" Fett; until the SE changed his voice which I really loved. \n\nI have spoken. Thank you Mr. Bulloch, Mr. Lucas, Mr Kershner and Mr. Wingreen. \n\nAlright, also thank you Mr. Morrison: you rock hard pretty hard in The Mandalorian :)",

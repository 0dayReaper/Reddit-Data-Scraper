    "postText": "\n\n\n\n\nim 27 years old and after avoiding it for so long, finallt watched the star wars saga inc all the movies and shows.\nthe prequels were average except for RotS which i thoroughly enjoyed and is my personal favourite. the OT werent bad by any means given that they are really old but they also werent as amazing as i thought theyd be. maybe because of jow much hype and love they get it felt underwhelming but still good. the sequels in my mind were never created and dont exist. my main question is about the prophecy and the chosen one. now while anakin is the chosen one and destined to destroy the sith... it is something he eventually does which was awesome  cant help but wonder tho if obi wan kenobi could have destroyed the sith long ago instead of it finally happening decades later. we all know anakin/darth vader has never been able to defeat obi wan kenobi. so if obi wan had just killed anakin properly in Rots or even after in their fight 10 years later, the sith would have been 50% decimated as palpatinewould have to look for a new apprentice which he wouldnt be able to find someone nearly half as talented as Anakin. after Anakins death by obi wan. surely Yoda and obi wana could have easily beat palpatine together. palpatine was strong af but could he really win a 2v1 agaisnt 2 jedi masters of their capabilities. or even better if they had help from a couple of the remaining jedi still alive after order 66. obi wan could of litterally been the chosen one to end the sith and bring balance wayy before anakin did decades later and alot of loved qould have been saved because of that had he just confirmed anakin was dead. im sire theres way bigger star wars heads out there that can tell me if this was even plausible and could of happen or im just reaching. would love to hear your thoughts with a nice and civilised conversation \ud83d\ude0a",

Honestly in my opinion devalues Vaders actions because now they are prophesied rather than just Vader wanting to save his son.",

            "comment": "I agree. Thats why the ending in Kenobi was badly written. The writer even said his original idea was to have vader win, because theres no way kenobi would leave vader alive if he won, knowing all the people he\u2019ll continue to kill. But there was meddling by other ppl who changed the ending. It\u2019s disney, so yeah.\n\nAlso agree about the order 66 survivor thing. They just been popping up way too often in the later shows. I think the original intention for luke\u2019s story was for him (and leia) to be that one final hope. Yoda even said luke would be the last jedi after yoda\u2019s passing.",

The prophecy was not fully realized until his death at Exogol.\n\nObi-Wan was not a part of the prophecy therefore nothing he did would have moved the goalposts closer. It's more likely his defeat of Anakin at Mustafar likely moved them farther back.\n\nEp 9 is the culmination of the Prophecy. They chose the wrong director to do Ep8 as that was the point where they should have fore shadowed this, instead of whatever that was he put out.\n\nPunctuation ftw. As short as that was, it was a tough read.",

Although it did weaken both.\n\nYes he was the chosen one, and he completed his task despite the multiple turns of events.\n\nRight, Sidious was the issue keeping the force out of balance. No one except his cult knew he was alive. JJ himself stated he was trying to make sense of what he was given to work with.\n\nGeorge Lucas likens balance as synonymous with the force being in the light. Before ep9 that was with Sidious and the FO. After ep9 it was with Rey, the Resistance and the Citizens Fleet.",

Even Sidious himself explicitly stated that he died in the encounter, and on waking up in his new body was a living corpse who knew only agony and pain. Which led to the creation of Rey as he sought to create a new body that could sustain him. We also know for a fact that the force was in balance directly following the events of ROTJ and only started to go out of balance when The influence of the dark side begin to take hold once again. Specifically when Ben Solo became Kylo Ren\n\nSidious would manipulate Ren and attempted to revive the Sith Order with himself as it\u2019s head but was stopped by Rey and Ben with the help of Anakin and the other Jedi.\n\nAnd all of that is besides the point. Your initial claim was that the events of TROS where the culmination of the prophecy, which we know to be false because Lucasfilm has explicitly stated in and out of universe that the prophecy was fulfilled by Anakin\u2019s actions in ROTJ. Which brought balance to the force and destroyed the sith as an institution with the deaths of the last two Sith Lords in the galaxy. Granted Palpatine\u2019s spirit would survive to find a clone body shortly after, but his condition was that of a broken and damaged spirit inhabiting a corpse that was only alive because of a machine keeping it from fully rotting away.",

Then there was Operation Cinder, more atrocities on a massive scale.\n\nSidious did die, his spirit did not. They may have thought his influence was gone, but it was not. Had Sidious spirit been destroyed, balance would have come sooner. But as that malignance had not been completely excised, it's influence would simply continue.\n\nYes, I believe I started my part in this thread by stating that Anakin did fulfill the prophecy by greatly weakening Sidious. My point is, it took a while to play out and culminated with his final \"death\" at Exogol.",

            "comment": "Bringing balance to the force ,to me, is to be interpreted as balancing light and dark. During the republic the light was too unbalanced -completely overshadowing the dark. \n\nControversial opinion but Anakin DID balance the force by allowing the world and himself to fall to the dark side- destroying the overwhelming light- and then killing the emperor- destroying the overwhelming darkness allowing Jedi and sith alike to hit a hard restart. Even if they\u2019re both basically reduced to nothing, nothing=nothing, math checks out perfectly balanced. \n\nThe dark side of the force isn\u2019t inherently bad and is needed, just as much as the light. Both light and dark are just like the force, it isn\u2019t bad, it isn\u2019t good, it just IS. \n\nObi wan couldn\u2019t of been the chosen one because he would\u2019ve simply reinstated the same exact corrupt and blind Jedi order that was in place at the time of the clone wars. \n\nAnakin is the chosen one, he is balance. He is light and dark, he is both Yin and Yang \u262f\ufe0f \n\nVery cool discussion though- excited to see if anyone agrees with my take on this bc I\u2019ve always saw it this way.",

The Force is life itself and when you try to bend it to your will through your own selfishness then it will strike back at you. Basically think of it like Sith creating cancer cells into the Force and themselves when they tap into it through the Dark Side. Dark Side is imbalance that needs to be corrected. Light Side is the natural way to tap into the Force as you allow the Force guide you rather than force it to your will,\n\nAfter all as Yoda [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEuA5Y_Cc88): \n\n&gt;*For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.*",

In Clone Wars, Anakin is again reaffirmed to be the chosen one by The Father, The Daughter, and The Son, who  personified  the Force, the Light Side and the Dark Side respectively. The Father wanted Anakin to take his place to keep his children \u201cin balance.\u201d After the death of The Son and Daughter, with his dying breath the Father declares Anakin\u2019s Destiny. \n\n\u201cYou are the chosen one. You have brought balance to this world. Stay on this path and you will do it again for the galaxy. But beware your heart.\u201d\n\nWhy was his world in balance? Was it because Anakin killed the son, the dark side of the force? Or was it because the Son and Daughter \u2014 the Dark and Light \u2014 were on equal footing, in this case dead. The second reasoning would be at odds with the Jedi\u2019s beliefs, but still makes visual sense.\n\n^^^^I copied this mostly from an article but it\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say with quotes and without over complicating things \n\nThe fathers quote to me is the most evidence we get, balance (AS DESCRIBED BY THE LITERAL FUCKING GOD OF BALANCE\ud83d\udc80) was only reached by the death of both the light and the dark, the daughter and the son, yin and Yang \n\n\nI don\u2019t follow the jedis translation of the prophecy because they\u2019re mostly jaded old war monks lost and blind by the time we see them, I don\u2019t follow the siths translation because they are manipulative and selfish. Even if George says the Jedis interpretation is correct I still feel like that\u2019s nothing more than his opinion on the story he made \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe story says what it says and TO ME (and many others after a bit of research) I think it\u2019s a story of the never ending battle and balance between light and dark. The force acts in mysterious ways not all good, not all bad, it simply just does what it does to keep the proper balance between light and dark. \n\nFor shits and giggles here\u2019s a stupid analogy \n\nIf you shined a flashlight on the sun it wouldn\u2019t do much good and you\u2019d be blinded and burned  by the overwhelming light of the sun, if you shine that same flashlight in a dark room it will light up the room. That light doesn\u2019t mean much of anything without darkness. \n\nIf you were in that situation on the sun, you\u2019d probably wish things were a little darker. They balance each other out.",

They aren\u2019t actually aspects of the force.\n\nThe Mortis arc is a metaphor for Anakin\u2019s inability to balance his positive and negative attitudes his inner light and darkness. As confirmed by the novel Skywalker: A family at war.\n\nThe episodes also make it clear that the Son wasn\u2019t a dark sider until the events of the arc where he is explicitly stated to of fallen. Not only that but in the EU it\u2019s even shown the Son was just a regular person before he drank from the front of power which made him start to fall to the dark side.\n\nEven if we do take them as actual representation of the force. The second the son falls to the dark side, the balance of Mortis is destroyed. It\u2019s his actions that destroy Mortis. Not the daughter or father. The son, the dark side sought to destroy the balance.\n\nLucasfilm has adamantly said the notion of a balance between the light and dark side is pure fan theory that run\u2019s counter to everything the franchise represents. It doesn\u2019t and will never exist. This is why Grey Jedi have never appeared in any canon media. The fact that the father openly says the dark side is a bad thing and that it needs to be resisted combined with Offical word from Lucasfilm and the overall lack of any evidence that balance between the two is possible pretty much makes it clear that this concept is pure nonsense. \n\nFurthermore rewatch the movies. The fact is that balance is restore when the dark side is not a factor anymore. When it\u2019d influence is non existent.\n\nYou can\u2019t use an idea that is consistently shot down by Lucasfilm as false.",

They are the force, dark, and light put into people. I would say they are the most pure humanoid representations we get of the three. Thus me phrasing them as personifications or gods. \n\nI don\u2019t think people need to be the medium that shows balance. The force itself is balanced. Anakin is born of the force -Constantly pushing and pulling manipulating the dark and breathing through the light. People are not balanced and that\u2019s the reason the series is in a never ending cycle of war. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a discussion of people being 50/50 good or bad, I don\u2019t think grey Jedi exist bc at that point they are just simply being themselves.  The light gives way for the shadows to rise, overwhelming darkness needs light. It\u2019s a constant push and pull, life and death. \n\n\nI\u2019m not saying the dark side within people isn\u2019t bad and shouldn\u2019t be destroyed, as I\u2019ve stated it\u2019s a slippery slope and usually ends in madness.\n\nWith that being said I think the force inherently creates dark side users to keep this balance. If the force can manipulate all things of life and guide Jedi through anything than I think it\u2019s not a far fetch that the same force could manipulate someone to evil. \n\nEveryone is a personification of the force- everything and anything doesn\u2019t really matter too much in universe bc the force will ultimately find balance. \n\nIt\u2019s yin and Yang. Pushes to one side and quickly falls to the other, rinse and repeat. It\u2019s been shown time and time again that the force will guide the universe back and forth. \n\nI don\u2019t really care about Lucas films saying no tbh. It doesn\u2019t change my opinion and i think a series as big as Star Wars would want public perception to be good is good bad is bad cut and dry no way around it. \n\nYou say to rewatch the movies, I\u2019m currently watching the movies and shows in chronological order- I\u2019ve just started andor.\n\nLook man it\u2019s my interpretation of the show and movies I\u2019ve spent my entire life watching, if you want to see it as cookie cutter good wins everytime stuff then by all means go ahead, just saying the series I watched was more complex than that.\n\nAt the end of day we\u2019re arguing a space religion and religions are VERY VERY open to interpretation",

I\u2019m\ntalking ab the very essence of the force and a space prophecy going into paragraph after paragraph of why I think this way, I\u2019ve thought this out lol\n\nYou say that light creates the force and makes it grow. \n\nI\u2019m not even going to get into the fact that the light doesn\u2019t create it, it\u2019s actually quite the opposite, the force ushers in light and brings darkness.\n\nI\u2019m about to hit you with another one of my half assed analogies\n\nWhat would happen to let\u2019s just say \u201ca garden\u201d if it was unrestricted to grow as much as it wants? It would become overgrown, corruption in the form of weeds would grow. \n\nYou see where I\u2019m going with this? The republic and most importantly the Jedi order are like this garden, overgrown, over used, hasn\u2019t been weeded properly in YEARS.\n\nThat\u2019s where darkness comes in. If you want the crops to grow (balance of the force) you need to clean up the over growth on the garden (order 66) \n \nLife and death, dark and light.\n\nDo some sith take advantage of this cycle by blowing up planets and shit? Yes they do but as I\u2019ve stated in another comment- the dark side is a slippery fuckin slope, it attracts selfish manipulators that blow up planets. On flip side the light side attracts pansies that are too afraid to leave the sanctuary of the Jedi temple. \n\nI\u2019m not discussing the users of the force- I\u2019m discussing the force itself and the way it has shown it acts in the shows and movies.\n\nChildish add on: you saying \u201cI don\u2019t swallow this\u201d right before my username had me gigglin and shi lmao",

Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.\n\nIf life creates The Force, it makes sense that the *natural cycle* of life and death keep The Force in balance.\n\n&gt;if a garden was unrestricted it would become overgrown, corruption in the form of weeds would grow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Republic and  The Jedi order are overgrown, over used.\n\nThat's just not so. The Jedi are Guardians of Peace and Justice, the Republic is the best form of government the galaxy has seen. No pogrom on the ethical Jedi (who were doing their best( was needed. No murder of 1.8 billion sentient beings was needed.\n\nThis is the point; balance consists of having as much life in a thriving state as possible. The Jedi and The Republic both insure the common good for the many rather than absolute power for the very few.\n\n&gt;Sith take advantage by blowing up planets...but...the light side attracts pansies that are too afraid to leave the sanctuary of the Jedi temple...\n\nThis is just not true. The Jedi are shown moderating a dispute at the very beginning of the story and protecting a senator, a steward of democracy. And how can you invoke the death of 1.8 billion beings and follow up with \"but...\" This is what I mean by shortsighted.\n\nLife creates The Force. Alderaan sustained life and when a living being dies it feeds the next form of life. When Alderaan was turned to ash life was stilled there forever. Less life = less of The Force.",

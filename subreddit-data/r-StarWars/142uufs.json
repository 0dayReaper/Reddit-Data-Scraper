They basically used older WW2 weapons and a few modern, hacked them, slapped a few together, added greeblies, etc. etc. but basically real world guns slapped with useless stuff to make them \"blasters\" of various sorts. \nIt's actually my only gripe with \"Andor\". I don't mind them using AK's, but they didn't bother hacking them up or adding enough \"junk\" to them to be \"sort of\" recognizable like they did with M-16's and such for the OG trilogy (the typical rebel rifle, i forget the alpha numerical SW name for it, not the Stormtroopers e-11). They just straight up look like space AK's and kind of took me out of the scenes they were used in.",

            "comment": "You're half correct. This is two weapon halves mashed together. \n\nThe front half (barrel, shroud, bipod, iron sights, and muzzle) is that of an MG 42. \n\nThe reciever, magazine, grip, and stock are that of an early-war model [FG 42](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG_42), a bit of a lesser known weapon but probably my personal favorite. It's a battle rifle, also chambered in 7.95x57mm Mauser (aka 8x57mm Mauser), used as a squad automatic weapon for the German Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Airborne/Paratrooper) infantry. The magazine's are either 10 or 20 rounds, this one looking to be a 20.\n\nAs for the optic, I'm not too familiar with them but if I'm not mistaken, that's a late war, a 3.5x magnification ZF4 scope.",

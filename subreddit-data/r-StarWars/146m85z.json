He's played by a different actor, Colin Higgins, who was originally slated to play Wedge but was fired and replaced by Denis Lawson. Both his and Lawson's lines were dubbed over by David Ankrum so they sound the same. In the fandom he was known as \"Fake Wedge\" until eventually he became a separate character who's in-universe nickname was \"Fake Wedge.\"",

He let himself be killed when if alive, could have greatly assisted Luke etc. as he would be a fucking killer Jedi.  \n\"More powerful than I imagine\" how? it's like a seance \"Use the force luke\". Yes, that probably helped, ya know what would have helped a lot more, a sabre wielding bad-ass Obi Wan.  \nLike he abandoned Luke who had pretty much zero force powers at that point and no military experience.",

What Han and Luke did was absolutely game changing and was in a much more critical moment. \n\nLet\u2019s think about this in a different context like football. Wedge shooting a TIE was like catching a ball for a first down in the first quarter. Sure it matters but not as much as Han cleaning up the TIE fighters aka catching a ball for a first down off of a 4th and 25 and ending up at the 5 yard line to allow the Rebels one more chance at getting the touchdown needed to win. Luke shoots the torpedos (runs for a TD) and blows up the Death Star/wins the football game as the clock runs out",

So by your logic, everyone who took flight was responsible for the victory in one way or another. The question here is how are you handing out medals? Either you are giving medals to everyone, including those posthumously, or you are giving medals to the specific ones responsible for the final shot. If you are in the final shot group, then that does not include Wedge, despite what he did earlier in the battle. There was no guarantee Luke was getting shot down. \n\nJMO. I find it stupid that 45+ years later, we are debating a meaningless scene in a movie. I'm not in either camp on the awarding of the medals. Don't really care at all. I never gave the scene any thought in 45 yrs until reading this post today. Maybe everyone is looking for more things to bash Lucas on.",

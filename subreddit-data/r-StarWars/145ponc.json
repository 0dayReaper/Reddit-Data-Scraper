Anakin Skywalker was dead and Vader was all that remained. \n\nHe did, in clone wars, lash out against the slavers when they had to rescue Ahsokas people after separatists took over her home world. It was very brief but you did get to a little Vader in Anakin.",

That might have been \"punk\" at the time but in retrospect it's pretty tasteless. Their name isn't all that imaginative either, Rebo might have been the group's musical director but my blue dude had an elephant-sized ego. I wonder if front woman Sy Snootles resented this self-styled Herbie Hancock, or maybe it was a concession she had to make to the broader musical scene, where male acts seem to dominate festival lineups.\n\nAll that said, pre-1997, the MRB had serious cred. Their songs held up with the galaxy's best jams. 1983, what a time to be alive: you could catch Rebo, then hop in a YT-1300 light freighter and catch the Endor Ewok Clan in their \"Yub Nub\" days. \n\nEasily one of the two best bands on Tatooine, Rebo's rivalry with Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes was one of the most productive in music history; that kind of friendly competition is what made the Four Tops and the Temptations keep aspiring to higher heights to outdo each other, and the same applied on the Dune Sea scene. And while the Nodes arguably produced a better single than Rebo ever delivered, the MRB's sui-generic jazz-funk-rock-pop fusion approach was more revolutionary than the Modal Nodes' electro-swing. \n\nIt's all the more impressive when you consider that the Rebo Band were a three piece. As such, they're one of the most revolutionary trios going, on par with Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Police, Nirvana, and Wilson Phillips. Droopy McCool was definitely the John Paul Jones of the group, who never quite received the appreciation lauded on Max and Sy, but damn did his contributions on Kitonak woodwind add some soaring countermelodies.\n\nPlus their concerts were legendary, like Parliament landing the Mothership legendary. We're talking six-titted babes getting down with Salacious Crumb in rooms full of hookah smoke. True story: I saw these guys do a gig where they hired Boba Fett and some rowdy Gammorreans for security, then \"Lapti Nek\" hyped the crowd up so much that a Twi'lek ended up getting ripped apart by a Rancor. It was like Altamont '83. \n\nDespite the selling out and the controversies attached to the band, it's tragically ironic that these guys joined the 27 club when they were wiped out on a sail barge by the Jedi they admired so much and his entourage. Three more luminaries, taken from us too soon.",

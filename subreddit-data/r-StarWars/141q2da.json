I'm wondering, should I read the Ascendancy trilogy before the Thrawn trilogy? My instinct is to read Ascendancy first since it's chronologically first, but I also hear that Zahn's methodical writing makes it better to read them in release order. Thoughts?",

            "comment": "Hmmm y'know, the new trilogies actually work either way, chronologically or release order \ud83e\udd14 I would say probably release order, that way you get some better payoffs on backstory hints set up in the Empire trilogy. Either way does work though...\n\nActually, as a matter of fact, you could and maybe even should Machete Order it. Read *Thrawn*, *Alliances*, then the entire Ascendancy Trilogy and finish it all off with *Treason*. I don't want to say why it makes sense and would pay off the most from reading in that order, but it does make sense and does pay off, plus that way you're finishing off with an Imperial Thrawn going into the show vs. young man Thrawn. The Ascendancy Trilogy really does fit in between Alliances and Treason exceptionally well the more I consider it, you'll see what I mean whichever way you decide to go. \n\n\nAlso, don't forget to watch Rebels! The Imperial Trilogy sets up and then ties into it **directly**, for a very basic timeline (gonna spoiler mark two locations, one character name, and one ship type here, but if you've seen the show then no worries at all; I'm marking these for those who haven't finished Rebels yet, no spoilers for the books here): \n\nSo, read *Thrawn* first then watch Rebels until the arc on &gt;!Atollon!&lt; with the (character spoiler) &gt;!Bendu!&lt; is finished, at that point read *Alliances* and continue watching Rebels until Thrawn is back on &gt;!Lothal!&lt; and you start seeing the prototype (ship type spoilers) &gt;!TIE Defenders!&lt; pop up, then read *Treason* as you simultaneously finish off Rebels at that point. \n\nHmm, yeah, the more I think about it, the more I love the idea of Machete Ordering these two trilogies alongside the relevant Rebels arcs (as the Rebels stuff is directly set up and referenced in the Thrawn Imperial Trilogy). I can't really explain why this order is excellent and possibly ideal without spoilers for the books, but trust me that treating the Ascendancy Trilogy as a kind of flashback/reflection on Thrawn's part before the events of *Treason* just simply works",

I know he'll kill the performance itself, but Thrawn is way too important a character both in-universe and out to end up in uncanny valley... I've been ~~huffing hopium~~ telling myself they haven't released it widely yet because they're finishing up tweaking the makeup and color in post production so it's absolutely perfect lol, really hope that's the case.\n\nThe two new Dark Jedi/Sith look awesome as well, first new characters in a while I'm legitimately excited to meet (the man reminds me of the Emperor from the old TOR cinematics and the woman has some big time Zannah vibes for me, she's almost exactly how I pictured her reading the Bane Trilogy); but I do really, really, *really* hope they continue building up the Grysk threat that Zahn has been setting up in the new trilogies. \n\nThat's an absolutely huge layup just waiting to be taken for the next half decade or so of shows and films if they pull it off, a gigantic new threat to the entire galaxy plus so much that can be done on-screen with the Ascendancy proper; for the love of god Disney don't fumble this one...show me Chiss battlecruisers working alongside ISDs and MC75s against the ~~Yuuzahn Vohng~~ Grysks, please! This is the direction they really should've taken the sequel trilogy IMO, but I'll take what I can get at this point lol",

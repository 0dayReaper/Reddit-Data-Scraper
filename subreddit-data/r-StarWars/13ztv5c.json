Of course there\u2019s other amazing characters I love in StarWars, CloneWars Maul has been my favorite for a long time, and of course I love Anakin/Vader, but the acting and writing for Luthen is on another level for me, such an interesting character. To be fair I feel like I should wait until season 2 to 100% say he\u2019s my favorite, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling now.",

I honestly hope that\u2019s not the case. Not a big fan of the idea of everyone in the Star Wars universe ending up being a Jedi, and I don\u2019t like the idea that regular people can\u2019t be exceptional. Or play critically important roles. I\u2019m clinging to the idea that the vast majority of people in the galaxy would not have been exposed to an actual Jedi. The idea of them was probably a mythological thing to many. And so many of the fans are frustrated, because light sabers and the Jedi are absent in the Andor story line. Personally, I find that to be refreshing.",

My theory is he and Galen Erso worked on the Death Star. Perhaps Luthen developed the equation for synthesizing kyber crystals for the weapon or something and once he figured out what was going on he, line Galen, bailed and went into hiding (in plain sight). It might explain the part in his monologue about an equation and why he has a kyber crystal and access to super cool space ship technology and understands the tactics of the Empire.",

Luthen's monologue mentions an equation from 15 years ago he also has access to kyber crystals (or at least one) and access to cool space ship tech while knowing how to not get caught by the Empire. I think he helped develope the Death Stars weapon, maybe the equation was how to synthesize the 8 giant kyber crystals that focus the weapon, or the equation for the weapon itself. I dunno, something like that. I just don't want him to be another space wizard, it's nice seeing regular people fighting the empire.",

It has the same problem a lot of Star Wars series have had, where the supposed main character so often feels like a by-stander in other people's stories. It would be one thing if Cassian had a sort of Jack Sparrow, James Bond energy that was fun to watch, but frankly he's just doesn't have the cool factor to watch him, while he watches other people, for 9+ hours. The most interesting thing about him was his search for his sister, which was unceremoniously dumped out the window halfway through.\n\nOn the other hand, Andor has Luthen, which... Ok just shove a needle in me and pump him directly into my veins",

Which of these 2 characters would you prefer to watch for 12 episodes?\n\nJust like the OT, I think this kind of story works better as a B-plot to someone else's A-plot. Strong protagonists need to have a lot of agency to drive the story, but these kinds of plots are fundamentally about a character *acquiring* agency that they don't have. How many times is Cassian just going along with someone else's ideas in Andor? I lost count pretty early. This is also part of why the prison arc is the best section, bc Cassian is the one leading the escape.",

He has depth, an actual on screen series of growth moments that \\*aren't\\* tied to him wanting tail, he's written better and IMHO the acting involved is superior.\n\nYou can not like him, I don't care, not everybody has to like the same things, but at the very least you could understand that Andor Season 1 is about the BIRTH/(growth?) of the kickass character we meet in RO, and not about Cassian Andor the Hero, so him having little agency for most of the series makes perfect sense.\n\nHe's a scumbag swindler surrounded by genuine heroes, and he learns something from them.",

They took out all the cool stuff from the star wars universe and made something ... else.   Even in the trailer where a big Tie Fighter cuts off one of the main characters while they're running, and the ship is right in their face - they cut that from the movie lol",

I'll never forget how I felt after, I was so floored at seeing what Disney was capable of.\n\nThis came out after TFA, which I really enjoyed(sadly the rest of the ST wasn't great), but it definitely felt formulaic. Tried and true Star Wars storytelling.\n\nRogue One blew me away, and really is the reason I've stuck with it, and given all the new material they make a chance. Some of its great, some so-so, but I'll give it all a chance.\n\nRogue One gave me Hope.",

I'd pretty given up on any good new content.\n\nThen Disney bought Star Wars, and I completely gave up. I was just like \"Damn, there goes any chance of new Star Wars stuff that matters.\"\n\nThen I saw Maleficent. Left the theater impressed by the movie, but my inner Star Wars nerd was already thinking \"Hmm, maybe...\" Watched TFA. Ok, now I'm excited. Then I saw Rogue One.\n\nHoly shit.",

Andor first really builds up to Rogue One as a crescendo, but Rogue One first adds an extra layer of tragedy to Andor.",

Star wars should focus more on the little guy, and I don't mean the underdog who is also a space wizard, or the nobody smuggler who destroys a bunch of tie fighters and becomes a general. I mean the urinal heads that get obliterated in the begining of ANH, I mean those Bothans that died for the plans, I mean the last defenses buying time on echo base as Hoth was vanquished by imperials. I want to see more stuff like rogue one in general really.",

            "comment": "There is at least one jedi whose fate\nIs still unclear. He did initially survived order 66, but it is unknown how long he survived afterwards. \n\nQuinlan Vos, the jedi that accompanied obi Wan when they went to find ziro in that one clone wars episode. \n\nIn canon, he was involved in the battle of Kashyyyk, and was shot by his clone commander, but managed to escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn marvel comics darth vader issue 7 (which is canon), Quinlan Vos is listed as one of the priority targets for the inquisitors. \n\nIn kenobi, his name appears carved into the wall in that hideout used by the Hidden Path, a movement that helped smuggle fugitives of the empire, especially other force sensitives. (The Hidden Path have also supposedly smuggled Jedi, but who they smuggled and whether those jedi survived afterwards is unclear, so for now I'm presuming that those jedi also eventually died). This implies that he survived at most till 9BBY for all we know. \n\nHowever,  it is unknown whether he truly survived until 9BBY, or even beyond. We can say for certain that he managed to escape the initial purge that was order 66.\nIt\u2019s still entirely plausible for only two jedi to have survived the entire purge, but we cant rule out quinlan vos just yet.",

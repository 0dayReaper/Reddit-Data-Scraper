This may be the source of his recent dreams\" Then suprise it is actually Sidious still alive and making force wielding clones. Why ruin this surprise in the first 20 seconds of the film?\n\nAnd for that matter why not have Anakin guiding Kylo (Ben) for real, instead of a fake out by Palpatine. Anakin helping Kylo infiltrate the dark side to find out the final secret plot of the Sith and destroy them forever...bringing balance to the force as was his destiny. Maybe Anakin was not capable of appearing as a force ghost because of his dark past but was able to commune with Ben through the Darth Vader helmet. Maybe this communication was actually private and Snoke/Sidious did not know that Ben/Anakin had been planning all along to destroy them and then hand the galaxy over to the people.",

The entirety of the prequels builds up to Palpatine's rise to power and every step is in service of it at the end. It felt like a story. The blockade of Naboo served a purpose. The separatists served a purpose. The Clone Wars served a purpose. \n\nThe sequels just feel like a bunch of action setpieces loosely strung together by a vaguely Star Wars-like story. There's no service toward the greater arc of the films, there's no dramatic plot points put in place that become important 2 movies down the line, it's just moving you steadily along to the next carnival ride. Even Snoke just feels like he existed solely to die in a dramatic and never-before-seen fashion in the next movie.",

People continued to struggle and die in the same conflict. Leia spent the rest of her life as general embroiled in the conflict. Han abandoned his family and heroic position in the rebellion to return to a life of crime, Luke went into a self exile after repeating the mistakes of the Jedi order. If anything the conflict is worse than ever without even the facade of a stable empire keeping thing in check.\n\nVader\u2019s redemption meant nothing. The emperor lived. History still remembers him as a monster, his own grandson idolized his dark side persona.\n\nAnd we ruined all of this for what? So a new group of heroes can swoop in and *really* stop the emperor / empire this time? Thanks for the happy ending with all our heroes laughing and celebrating in a forest Disney but I liked it better when I saw it 37 years ago.\n\nAnd the thing is - I like the new characters. I think Finn / Rey / Poe / and Kylo are all really great characters with talented actors portraying them - they deserved a better story, their own story.",

They had just spent $4 billion to purchase LF, and knew a new trilogy of *SW* movies would make them billions. So to recover the $4 billion as soon as possible, they began work on the st right away. They likely thought a plan would slow production and delay them cranking the movies out.",

            "comment": "i'm a shameless sequel lover, but i almost fell out of my seat when i saw this in theaters... it just boggles my mind on so many levels. like, how did this *inanimate* and lifeless dagger know *precisely* how the DS2 would wreck? how did it know to accommodate for a myriad of structural failures and 30 years of stormy weather conditions? It's just a dagger... how can it accurately predict any of this?\n\nso ok, i can't figure out the damn dagger. time to turn to special features to see what the thinking was behind this. maybe I'm just obtuse and I don't understand it. Nope! JJ literally says \"I like the idea that she could just pull this out of the side of the dagger and say \"there it is.\"\" Like, JJ explicitly sought the most incomprehensible plot point when presented with like 6 other options that all would have made sense to some degree. JJ... you're immensely talented and I love a lot of what you did with TFA and TROS, that said... *what in the flying fuck* dude? like, just... just what? that's all I can say. I'm speechless except for \"*what?\"*",

Everyone would know where the wreckage of the second Death Star landed. Where did the Emperor chill on the Death Star? Oh yeah, his throne room\u2014which incidentally is also where he was last seen 30 years ago. \n\nSomeone would have looted that shit years before. It\u2019s like designing a scavenger hunt to find the Emperor\u2019s loose change, and discovering it\u2019s in his sock drawer on Coruscant. Well no shit.",

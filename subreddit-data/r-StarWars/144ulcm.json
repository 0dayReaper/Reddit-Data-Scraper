    "postText": "I\u2019ve seen a torn argument between multiple explanations. Some people say it\u2019s because of the injuries he sustained after fighting Obi-Wan, he lost a lot of midi-chlorians and that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t find his entire potential in the force. Some people say that the suit limits him. Some people argue that neither are true, and that the real reason he wasn\u2019t as powerful was because his fight with Obi-Wan and abandonment ultimately traumatized him. I personally think it could be a mixture of all things, but this seems like the perfect place to ask the question and have the discussion. So what does everyone think?",

Anakin Skywalker was seduced by *that* power, not the other way around.  Darth Vader, although strong in The Force, knew he was no match for The Emperor unless  his son, Luke Skywalker, joined his growing powers with Vader's.\n\nHowever, thanks to the PT existing, who knows?  STAR WARS ultimately is not hard sci-fi nor does it have some hard canon.  It is (more) modern mythology that Lucas and others worked together to dream up.  The OT talks about the PT one way.  The PT and RO:ASWS tell things differently.  Then there are the ST, THR, and EU/Legends.",

There's no real way to answer why Anakin never reached his \"full potential\".  Toss it up to losing too many midichlorians, but that answer feels a bit unsatisfying.\n\nI prefer just to forget about the PT's \"chosen one prophecy weirdness\".",

This is why a full-body Anakin would not have too much trouble beating Vader.",

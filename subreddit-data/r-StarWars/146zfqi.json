Pre order bonus will give you a new storyline set on another planet, and season roadmap to include 3-4 locations (including the pre order dlc). You\u2019ll be able to sneak around and infiltrate, or go all out and be explosive. \n\nEach planet will have a large area to play in like most \u201copen world\u201d games. They\u2019ll utilized AC\u2019s crowd systems. Zones will be under control by syndicate and imperials which you can go to, kill everyone, and then liberate. Get to the highest point or maybe in this case find the uplink to reveal that section of the map. Utilize your pet alien to mark enemies, or perhaps the commando droid will have a UAV that he can throw into the air to mark enemies or get a birds eye view. \n\nSaid something about division devs so this could be a looter 3P shooter where your guns shoot out numbers, find epic guns or legendary equipment to do more damage. \n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong. I wish Ubi would break from this mold. It\u2019s carried in every game, farcry, GR, Assassin\u2019s creed, the division, and personally I dislike rpg looter shooters where shooting someone just pops a number out. I\u2019d love something more skill centered where the challenge is in how you approach a situation rather than \u201cI just need a gun that deals more damage\u201d.\n\nI guess we\u2019ll see tomorrow.",

That's enough to get me interested in it. Especially since it's just a *reveal* trailer, which are usually just meant to be cinematic when it comes to single player games.\n\nHonestly though, Microsoft is playing it smart by putting everything on Gamespass. There are at least 5 games they've announced that peak my interest and will be on there. There is absolutely no reason for me not to just try them out with no regrets by paying a fraction of the full price for a month of Gamespass And on PC to boot.",

Pre-order bonus gets you a Darth Maul skin for your astromech droid. \n\nRecommended specs: Intel i7 12700k, Nvidia RTX 3060ti, 16gb RAM, 280gb storage.\n\nAll versions will be completely broken at launch, optimisation will not be a feature, and a high-end PC will struggle to maintain 40fps.\n\nUbisoft Connect will never work, and you'll have to screw around with it every time you try to boot the game. \n\nMany Youtube reviewers will rip the game apart, Star Wars apologists will praise it. IGN will give it a 7/10, which for them is essentially a 3/10, it will begin at \"mixed,\" but eventually sit at \"mostly positive\" on Steam.\n\nWe might receive a vapid, disingenuous black background/white text apology card after negative reviews featuring such corporate boilerplate as \"sorry we missed the mark,\" and \"our team is extremely committed to delivering the best experience possible,\" etc.\n\n10 months after release and after a 40gb patch, the game will be running much better. However, the writing of the game's story is still lackluster. The gameplay is fun and engaging, but the world is empty, and the plot/characters are terrible.\n\nIn spite of it all, the game will be a financial success, mostly due to the Star Wars IP. Loads of people will pre-order it, and the in-game store will make millions in MTX. The hype train will come and go, and the zeitgeist will die off in a few months. There will be a loyal fan base, but the game will largely be forgotten.",

Bendu, Mortis, crystals, holocrons, temples\u2026 fusions of the power of the universe and the science of those in touch with it.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t we see anything like this in the sequels? All we ever see is normal people with the most shallow use and understanding of the force\u2026 so much wasted potential. I\u2019m rewatching rebels atm and it\u2019s revealing how much better new content could be.",

            "comment": "I believe this is how it's been explained:\n\nThe sequel characters were not trained by Jedi masters. Most were wiped out in Order 66 so there are very few Jedi left capable of teaching the high-level tricks to the next generation. So you just have people just kinda figuring things out on their own.",

The writers of the sequels wrote themselves into a boring corner by saying no jedi masters were left to teach the new generation deep connections to the force. \n\nEven without the masters, you can watch Laban and Ezra figure the deep mystical stuff out mostly on their own. They find powerful connections to the force, ways to connect with the old masters, and creative solutions to mystical force problems. It\u2019s an issue of creativity and laziness, not being forced to write anything a certain way because that\u2019s where the story is.",

One of the two times Rey visits it. That place just felt like an island with a tree on it with some books in it. No special connection to the force whatsoever. They almost went somewhere with the dark nexus of the cave, but it fell flat because nothing even happened.",

            "comment": "(While I understand the Era of the old republic isn't technically cannon)\n\nThere is a fascinating world that exists in the old republic Era called: Nathema. It's described as a world where the force had been completely stripped away by a sith ritual. Force sensitives who approach it in space or land on its surface are described as feeling physically sick and since there is an absolute lack of the force they can't really use any of their abilities. Even something as simple as being able to sense danger is not possible there. Its the closest thing to an \"alien\" world in star wars as there is nothing normal about it.\n\nWhere its depicted its also mentioned that the world lacks color to it and that it feels dead, even the orange star it orbits looks pale when viewed from the surface... I'm not entirely sure about whether its ever shown. But I recall that even non force sensitive individuals also feel that something is just \"off\" about Naethema. Like its an error in the universe and shouldn't exist.\n\nI highly reccomend reading about it as its a fascinating dive into how star wars characters talk about the force being ever present, and in relation to Naethema what it would be like if it didn't exist. If the force is an ever-present concept... Naethema explores how people and most importantly jedi AND sith would feel if it was ever removed...",

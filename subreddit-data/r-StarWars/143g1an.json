    "postText": "I accidentally ordered the three young-adult novels first, since it was a complete box, and didn't bother to ensure it included the three adult novels, Light of the Jedi, The Rising Storm, and The Fallen Star, that I initially intended to get. Now, can I read the three novels I received or do I have to order and wait for the other books to arrive, and read them first?",

            "comment": "I wouldn't recommend it, the adult novels are usually considered necessary reading for the corresponding YA novel. Light of the Jedi especially is intended as an introduction to the era too, Into the Dark kinda assumes you know what you're dealing with iirc.",

            "comment": "You can probably read the first, Into the Dark, without spoiling anything major from the main adult trilogy. You shouldn\u2019t read Out of the Shadows though, and you especially shouldn\u2019t read Midnight Horizon, until you finish the preceding adult novels. I\u2019d also really recommend picking up the first JR book honestly, it\u2019s got basic prose, and a simple story, but it\u2019s a good simple story, introduces two major characters, and has good character work I think. Plus it\u2019s cheap lol. Imo, a good reading order for your situation would be\n1. into the Dark \n2. Light of the Jedi (buy it now, read into the dark while it\u2019s coming maybe?)\n3. A Test of Courage (the junior reader book)\n4. rising storm \n5. Out of the shadows \n6. The fallen star\n7. Midnight horizon",

            "comment": "A Cal episode or two sounds like it could be good. As long as nothing like major major happens with him, He is first &amp; foremost a video game character &amp; if he got like a mini-series imo that would be taking away too much of player's \"ownership\" of him if that makes sense.  But a little one-shot maybe one team-up mission/episode in Ahsoka/Mando/whatever I think would be cool, especially with Cameron Monaghan's talent as an actor.\n\nJedi: Survivor spoiler: &gt;!Bode I think would be perfect for Tales of the Jedi though.  What being a Jedi spy during the war was like, perhaps working a bit with like Quinlan Voss but Denvik for sure.  How he learned Order 66 happened, meeting his wife, cutting the deal, how an ex-Jedi working for the ISB would function, so much potential.  Plus his voice actor was also Admiral Rampart from Bad Batch (along with one of the Imperial pilots in Squadrons featured in that excellent [cinematic](https://youtu.be/f2VmOqjV_7Q)) so the annimation department should be able to get him back!&lt;\n\nDepa &amp; Caleb(Kanan) I'm not sure a Tales of the Jedi would do much for.  There's only so much foreshadowing they could do for him. Post Order 66 &amp; maybe meeting Hera though might be kinda cool, but I know there's books that cover that (not that that's stopped them from using him in The Bad Batch premier or Ahsoka in Tales of the Jedi)\n\nThe main character I'm holding out for though is Bariss Offeee, how a Jedi like her falls to the dark side &amp; what happens to her after being arrested for treason I so desperately want to see.  Thanks for the post the OP they're good suggestions &amp; I enjoyed thinking about them.",

Use this opportunity to explain his role with the Separatists and why he might have run away from the Jedi Council, make Darth Maul *his* apprentice. \n\nThis way in Attack of the Clone, the reveal to Obi-Wan that he was Qui-Gon's master and that he's only working for a bigger threat, Darth Sidious, have way more impact.",

Something like a foil to Anakin's dark side growth also being through love (albeit a different kind of love, obviously) but turning into something significantly darker, while Dooku's is an honorable sort of emotion based dark side.

The personal connection would make Obi Wan's fight with him more interesting, and there could potentially be some tension on the Council with regards to sending Obi Wan due to their history. It could also be interesting to build on the tension between Maul and Dooku due to Maul killing Dooku's apprentice. This might shake Dooku's faith in their cause or it might strengthen it, but it could lead to some consequences with Sidious and Dooku's eventual death at his orders.\n\nIn retrospect it's a bit annoying that Lucas had Maul actually cut in half. You have a lot of flexibility in having your bad guy fall down a pit to their death, since it's about as onscreen as an offscreen death can be. He could have easily brought Maul back in a movie or two. But he tied up that plot thread pretty tightly by cutting him in half, all for a half second of shock value.\n\nObviously that didn't stop the expanded universe from bringing him back, but that was a bit out there.",

Suddenly Dooku realises he is in danger of actually losing the duel, and attempts to remove Obi Wan as quickly as possible to focus on Anakin.\n\nThe descriptions of the way the force users sense each other is great. I would have loved to have seen the trippy, psychadelic version of the duel in the Chancellor's office where Palpatine is described as a shadow obscuring the Jedis' vision who moves so fast only Mace stands a chance, and Anakin sees the green glow of Kit Fisto's lightsaber go out as he's driving the speeder towards the Senate.",

His decapacitated head that no longer attached to his body, proceeds to fly up into the air, flips over a few times and then landed perfectly on the desk, neck first with Kit' smiling face facing Anakin when he entered Palpatine's office.\n\nTruly, the Force works in mysterious ways.

He does not see who the combatants are yet, only their lightsabers. When Fisto's green blade disappears, he rushes into the office. There, he finds Kolar's corpse and the severed heads of Tiin and Fisto. Anakin then watches the lightsaber duel between Windu and Palpatine for some time; in the film, he arrives just in time to see Windu knock Palpatine down.",

Windu takes Obi-Wan to the side and tells him they\u2019re sending him after Greivous, because he\u2019s the best fighter they have. How his defensive fighting-style allows him to never get cornered or taken off-guard, allowing him to take the window when it\u2019s eventually given. Something that he does later against Anakin; fought defensively until his opponent was cornered and had no escape.\n\nI figure it\u2019s something he learned from his duel against Maul. He watched Qui-Gonn wear himself out trying to take down his opponent and eventually succumbed to his weariness giving his opponent an opening.",

Determination, resolve, that kind of thing. Similar to Plo Koon's Electric Judgement, a Jedi force lightning technique. They were both considered very dangerous, because keeping the strong emotions was difficult to do without allowing dark influences in as well. Vapaad even more so because you had to \"insulate\" yourself against the dark side you channeled through yourself from your opponent and back to them, and I think it also utilized the user's violence, but devoid of hate or anger, an extremely tight rope to walk.",

He uses form seven, which is forbidden for Jedi to use because it basically \"flirts with the dark side\" and it is super dangerous for any normal Jedi to use, since by using this form, they could potentially turn to the dark side. Note that Windu isn't a normal Jedi. The guy grabbed himself a purple lightsaber color when he built his famous silver and gold lightsaber, and the combination of red and blue makes purple, light and dark combined makes form seven. This is one of the reasons why he was able to go toe to toe with Palpatine, and he almost beat him and killed him. If Anakin hadn't intervened, Order 66 never would have happened, the Empire never would have happened, Anakin wouldn't have become Darth Vader, and there would cease to be any Sith in the galaxy. In short, the original trilogy wouldn't have canonically happened. It would be a fanfic made by some nerd about if Anakin *did* intervene.",

Sidious had never planned to make Dooku his apprentice and even less a Sith Lord, this place was for Darth Maul.  In old canon and in new canon, Maul was trained to perform Tyranus\u2019 job. If Maul hadn\u2019t have been cut in half by Obi Wan on Naboo, then he would not have been replaced; however, by that time, Sidious had learned of Anakin and his potential. Maul would eventually been replaced by him, but never by Tyranus.",

Presumably he hedged Vader with someone else in the meantime (perhaps that was the purpose of the Inquisitors?).

He never had a chance of resisting Palpatine\u2019s temptation because he can barely process what\u2019s going on, feels dizzy like the room is spinning, everything Palpatine says is carefully calculated to sound reasonable on its surface (and Anakin is physically incapable of thinking any deeper at the time), and by the time Anakin gets enough sleep to start seeing things clearly again, he\u2019s already done such unspeakable things and lost everyone he\u2019s ever cared about, that he realises he can never go back even though he\u2019d do it in a heartbeat if he could. Rested, rational Anakin commits to Palpatine\u2019s side because he believes he no longer has a choice. The \u201cfrom my point of view the Jedi are evil\u201d line was meant to indicate that at that moment, Anakin\u2019s mind is so deranged that he is legally incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.\n\nA man like Obi-Wan would still be able to tell the difference but Obi-Wan has always been extremely black and white on that sort of thing; we\u2019ve seen throughout The Clone Wars that Anakin is more accustomed to operating in grey areas and doesn\u2019t follow *rules* of right and wrong but his *sense* of right and wrong. It serves him well but when he\u2019s robbed of it he has no codified system to fall back on to help him figure up from down. He defaults to \u201cprotect Padm\u00e9\u201d as his guide and the over-simplicity of that leads him very far astray.",

                            "comment": "I still think there were some truth in what Anakin said. The Jedi weren't exactly evil, but they've been led astray ever since the Clone Wars. They weren't peacekeepers, they were agents of war and no amount of \"We're the good guys, the CIS are the baddies!\" could absolve them. Granted in the new canon, the Jedi were blinded to some of the mystic Force shit that Sheev was concocting, not to mention the Sith shrine built underneath the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. I think Mace Windu was the highest form of arrogance for the Jedi, even Yoda didn't do anything to stop that kind of thinking, the kind of thinking that says, \"The Jedi can do no wrong,\"\n\nThe Republic has been corrupt for a long time, and it slowly seeped into the Jedi Council, and sure there were some good heads, but if those better heads like Plo Koon, Yoda or Obi-Wan persevered more, they could have helped Anakin resist the dark side better. \n\nSide note, I'm reminded of a fanfic which shows Anakin resisted the dark side and killed Sheev. The Clone Wars end, and he comes clean to the council about his marriage. To his surprise, he's not expelled, rather put on a really long probation. Much to his bigger surprise, years later, after the birth of Luke and Leia (who now go to school and have a twin telepath thing going in classes) he's being considered for a Jedi Master position. It was a really feel good story. But alas, can't find it anymore. It was called the Ties That Bind Us To The Force I think.",

His sense of morality may be more in line with the council, but he also isn't afraid to bend or break the code when he feels the need to, he is basically a less radical Qui-Gon. He is aware of Anakin's feelings about Padme, but instead of making sure Anakin quashes them as the council would, he lets him find his own path. He lets his feelings for Satine paralyze him on at least one occasion, and has underworld connection most black-and-white Jedi would probably shy away from.",

That moment isn't about Anakin being evil, but merely showing that him ending up there didn't come out of *nowhere*.",

But that's the thing; if Anakin isn't turned, it doesn't matter anyway, he might as well die, because without Anakin there is no Emperor Palpatine, and what's the point of being so powerful if you can't own the entire galaxy.

From a dissenting council member, a friend of Qui Gon, to then being convinced by the dark side, and eventually to this final moment.\n\nI kinda want to sit down and rewrite the prequels with no regard of having to fit it into 3 films. Anyone want to start a casual writers room?",

                    "comment": "Stover is, bar none, the best author to pen books for Star Wars. Most Star Wars books are pretty straight forward bang bang space opera pulp. That is fine, that is mostly what Star Wars is anyway. \n\nStover actually went out of his way to do things like develop characters, reveal motivations, play with philosophy, establish real themes, and introduce new ideas. His Star Wars  books have a depth to them that others just don\u2019t.\n\nFor all the faults in the NJO, Traitor is is still my all time favorite Star Wars novel. It is a brilliantly twisted master and apprentice story that really explores the nature of the Force and how and why it was used. It really did make me think. The way it was all overwritten and retconned after the fact still cheeses me off. \n\nI sometimes wonder if his more in-depth style was just disliked by the powers that be.   His last Star Wars book(Shadow over Mindor) is a completely over the top cheesy space adventure.  It really steers into what is expected. However the whole story is framed in such a way that it acknowledges exactly what it is, and winks at the reader.  It really was great spin on the genre.",

For the most part it's just stories of adventure and it's not a continuous plot driven show. You could probably search around reddit and find someone's guide as to which episodes are most important to the grand story or maybe search IMDB or something and watch the ones with the best ratings. \n\nThere is a lot of rinse and repeat especially in season 1 where all Anikin does is disobey orders but saves the day anyway, lots of blockade busting.",

It gets much much better now that everyone is established.\n\nRebels builds off of the original ending of Clone Wars. You could watch it without completing Clone Wars first but you'll lose context.\n\nYou don't need Clone Wars for the sequel trilogy.  They actually tie in more with several books set in the period between ROTJ and TFA that explain the politics and end of the war.\n\nThe Disney+ shows (other than Bad Batch, which is basically a direct continuation) don't strictly require Clone Wars, but you'll lose context when characters show up or references are made, especially in The Mandalorian.",

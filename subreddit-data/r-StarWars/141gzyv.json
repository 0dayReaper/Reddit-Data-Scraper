    "postText": "I keep seeing write ups and videos describing Thrawn as the main Villain in the upcoming sequence of shows and films (Ahsoka, Mando S4 etc) \n\nThe new Timothy Zahn books (Canonical) instead place Thrawn as more of an intelligent opportunist who infiltrated the empire to secure a degree of safety for his people. His role in the upcoming stories is likely to maintain this complexity\u2026 and with the empire gone, what will become of his goals? Will the Grysks instead be the villains?",

            "comment": "His rationale was that he is willing to do evil things to accomplish the greater good, which is to protect the galaxy from a much greater threat that is coming from outside. So he's like Ozzymandias, killing millions to save trillions. Where he clearly has miscalculated, is his presumption that only the Empire will have the possible chance of defeating this oncoming threat. So therefore his plan is to defeat the Rebel Alliance/New Republic and make sure that the Empire reigns supreme so that it will be able to take on this threat when it arrives.\n\nOf course the huge gaping flaw in this plan, is that whoever wins the war will be in a weakened state because they have just been fighting a war. Would it not have been smarter to arrange some sort of truce so that everyone can be on the same side without killing off and destroying huge numbers of their manpower and ships? And also what's taking this threat so long to get there that he knows about it years and years in advance, but no one else does?",

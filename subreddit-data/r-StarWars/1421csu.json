They worked as her bodyguards basically for twenty years before writers quietly stopped mentioning them. But their intention was to just guard her *forever*. \n\nLuke never made a secret out of his parentage, and while he doesn't scream about it on every corner, he often discloses it when he feels it appropriate to make a point about dangers of the Dark Side.",

On top of that, around the time that Luke and Leia had started to reveal it, Mon Mothma had made Leia the head of state. It really wasn't a polarizing revelation.",

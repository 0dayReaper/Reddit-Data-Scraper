The back of *The Phantom Menace* videotape says \"Set thirty years before the original STAR WARS film...\" Then *Attack of the Clones* takes place 10 years later, 20 years before the original movie. Since Luke and Leia were canonically 19 in *A New Hope*, they altered the timeline so that *The Phantom Menace* took place in 32 BBY and *Attack of the Clones* was in 22 BBY, so that *Revenge of the Sith* could take place in 19 BBY, with a few years in between Episodes II and III for the Clone Wars to take place.",

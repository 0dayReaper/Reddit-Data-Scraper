You could continue on in release order and watch the prequels  (Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith) which would be the default pick, or you could watch the Mandalorian (a show about a bounty hunter set after RotJ), or Rogue One + Andor (a show and movie about the birth of the rebellion before ANH ), or the sequels (movies set a generation after RotJ).",

She's really sadistic and driven entirely by a thirst for revenge right up to the end of the show. That never changes for her at any point. She is out for blood from the end of season 1 to the end of the show itself.",

In the books, it's not entirely clear if Arya will realize they aren't the same thing or not. In the show, though, she is all about that vengeance. She wants it more than anyone else in the cast. Take the last season, for example. It's not enough that Cerci is 110% for sure going to die in horrible dragon fire. Arya needs to personally drive a blade into Cerci's heart and look in her eyes while she does it. This girl has been lulling herself to sleep for years by muttering the names of every man woman and child that she plans to personally remove from the world. It takes one of the like 4 people left alive who she cares about at all explaining she will also for sure die too and besides he's got it covered anyway to get her to back down and not wind up part of that episodes body count. If the only thing about her circumstances to change was the addition of force powers, she might've started choking dudes to death and tossing force lightning before before she was 12. The girl is driven, and believes using violence against anyone and everyone who has wronged her or harmed her family is not only justified but required if she is ever to move forward. She's basically the punisher, but short.",

Don't get me wrong, I agree completely. Arya Stark would be a sith easily. Perhaps even more easily than Darth Vader himself.\n\n&gt;She's basically the punisher, but short.\n\nShe's basically Dooku, lol",

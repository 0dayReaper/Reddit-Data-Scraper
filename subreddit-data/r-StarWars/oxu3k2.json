The good guys are the rebels, they are using asymmetric warfare against a highly organized empire. I think we call those guys terrorists today. We call them Mujahedin, we call them Al Qaeda \n\n&gt;George Lucas: When I did it they were Viet Cong\n\n&gt;James Cameron: Exactly, so were you thinking of that at the time?\n\n&gt;George Lucas: Yes\n\n&gt;James Cameron: So it was a very anti-authoritarian, very kind of 60's kind of against the man kind of thing. Nested deep inside of a fantasy.\n\n&gt;George Lucas: or, or a colonial. You know we're fighting the largest empire in the world.\n\n&gt;James Cameron: Right\n\n&gt;George Lucas: and we're just a bunch of hayseeds in coonskin hats who don't know nothing. \n\n&gt;James Cameron: That's right, that's right.\n\n&gt;George Lucas: and it was the same thing with the Vietnamese and the irony of that one is in both of those... the little guys won.\n\n&gt;James Cameron: Right\n\n&gt;George Lucas: And the big highly technical, empire...\n\n&gt;James Cameron: The English empire? \n\n&gt;George Lucas: The English empire, the American empire lost. That was the whole point. \n\n&gt;James Cameron: But that's a classic us not profiting from the lessons of history because you look at the inception of this country and it's very... it's a very noble fight of the underdog against the massive empire. You look at the situation now where America's so proud of being the biggest economy, the most powerful military force on the planet. It's become the empire from the perspective of a lot of people around the world.\n\n&gt;George Lucas: It was the empire during the Vietnam War. And... but we never learned you know from England or Rome or you know a dozen other empires around the world...\n\n&gt;James Cameron: Empires fall \n\n&gt;George Lucas: that went on for hundreds of years. Sometimes thousands of years. We never got it. We never said well wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This isn't the right thing to do. And we're still struggling with it. \n\n&gt;James Cameron: And they fall because of failure of leadership or government often and...\n\n&gt;George Lucas: Mostly its...\n\n&gt;James Cameron: You have a great line which is \"So this is how liberty dies to...\n\n&gt;George Lucas: We're in the middle of it right now.\n\n&gt;James Cameron: to thunderous applause. Exactly it's the... it was a condemnation of populism in a science fiction context. \n\n&gt;George Lucas: That's a theme that runs all the way through Star Wars.",

A contractor comes into the store and overhears Randal telling Dante that in order to complete the second deathstar, the Empire must have hired independent contractors, plumbers and builders and all that, to get it done quickly and quietly after the first one was destroyed. Randal had no problem with the first one being destroyed as it was probably only inhabited by imperials, evil is punished, no big. But the second one was a bunch of apolitical contractors who were just trying to scrape out a living on a big, well paying job.\n\n\nThe contractor in the store tells a story of how he, a roofer, was offered a simple reshingling job, and that if he could do it in a day, his pay would be doubled. The contractor tells of how he figured out whose house it was and turned it down. The house belonged to a gangster. He knew the man, knew what he was capable of, and turned it down. The money was good, but the risk was too high. He didn't wanna risk upsetting a mob boss. So he passed that job onto a buddy. While the buddy was working on the house, a rival gang puts out a hit on the mobster and his buddy gets shot in the crossfire. Wasn't even done reshingling the house.\n\n\nThose contractors knew the risk going into working on the death star. But they took the job anyway.\n\n\n\nEdit: thank your the gold :)\n\n\n\nEdit 2: many people are pointing out the empire didn't really ask for help on the death star. They kinda demanded it...\n\n\nEdit 3: or robots. Lots of robots.",

There was growth through the seasons for all of them, as they grew into different people, that sometimes made all new mistakes, sometimes repeated the past ones, but still made at least some progress.

People sometimes say he wasn't as bad of a person as the others, but really it's just his spacey goofiness that masks it.

I never really understood why the Rebels were the good guys and the Empire the bad ones except from the fact that the plot decided to tag one side as the good ones and the other the bad ones.\n\nSo I never was really fan of SW.

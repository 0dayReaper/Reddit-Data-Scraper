            "comment": "Most people who aren't found as a child don't get any real training and so they aren't really a concern, if they really manifest at all their talents will rust with disuse and lack of honing. \n\nthe problem that leads to them favoring children is that being a lightsider is a lifetime commitment to a very narrow path and there's a lot trying to get you to step off it. Could people taken older do that? Sure, it happens, but it's signifgantly easier to cut the risk of  falling to the darkside happening if you raise them from near-birth with the path of the lightside as their guide. It's also why they use the centralized temple instead of just being, all over the place delving into who knows what with barely any supervision.",

Also toddlers can do many things that they'd later forget if they didn't practice every day. One thing I can think of is swimming.",

After this happens, you need to both break their set pre-conceptions about what is possible and what is not. And you also have to deal with baggage they bring with them, like parents dying, loved ones in danger, etc. \n\nWhen you train a child from a young age, before they start forgetting magical powers - and especially when you put them into environment with other magical children, you no longer need to break any preconceptions and instead just have to reinforce the magical reality around them. It saves A LOT of hassle when training a Force-user.",

Thats the whole point - the Jedi dont want to be responsible for creating powerful dark side users, so they will only train someone who is young enough to not have baggage that will lead them to the dark side.\n\nPeople like Anakin and Luke, had they never met the Jedi, would have just continued their lives, just being really good at certain things but not really knowing why.",

The more time spent out in the world where you're influenced by other things is less time than you would have had learning the Jedi way. \n\nAnakin and Luke's formative years had a big impact on their personalities. Those personalities eventually collided with the Jedi.\n\nIt's a metaphor for religion. Instill the doctrine in someone in their formative years and they will believe for life. Anakin and Luke are \"rebels\" because they questioned the Jedi order.",

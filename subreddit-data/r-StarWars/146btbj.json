Then move your way through the rest of the content.\n\nThis is how the universe and its concept are introduced, a lot of them will be spoiled in the chronological order as well as important plots of the storyline. Plus the prequels being released 20 years later they reference the OT in several occasions and you might miss that by not starting by the OT.",

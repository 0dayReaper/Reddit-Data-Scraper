    "postText": "Little backstory: I was watching through all the Star Wars movies on Disney + when I felt some sort of nostalgia on Revenge of the Sith, then I remember watching the some of the episodes when I was younger on some hotel. I then decided to look around on my dad's closet after watching A New Hope because I remember him having some DVDs kept away that he got before I was born.\n\nI saw this along with other old late 90s movies, it's also pretty different from the ones I saw online, but I decided to share it to you guys!",

It was mainly caught on in Asian regions until DVDs became more affordable. In most other regions VHS was the preferred consumer video storage format until DVDs.",

When the Original Trilogy was finally released on DVD it was altered, again. So they're not quite the same as the 97 versions.",

Until Marvel started, simultaneous global release was rare, and \u201cglobal\u201doften meant, \u201cEurope and Japan\u201d, so VCDs prospered in those regions.",

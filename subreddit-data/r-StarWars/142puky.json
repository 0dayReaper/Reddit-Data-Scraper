You provide people with a service/product they like and enjoy, and in return you get some money for it. \n\nThey enjoy the product/service, and you, as the provider, enjoy the financial return (and perhaps to an extent providing the service and interacting with them)\n\n\nAnd if you don't want to buy the product or service, or find the price prohibitive, or if you have problems with the person/business themselves, then you don't have to purchase it. \n\n*Note, there are situations where that's not the case, I'm generalising here.",

            "comment": "Dooku was already Palpatine's apprentice then. \n\nWould Palpatine send him back to the Jedi? Not permanently. Dooku is needed to form the Separatists. There would be an attack or an accident the first time Dooku and Anakin went on a mission. Anakin would be reported killed. Dooku would leave the Order again permanently. \n\nAnakin would be trained by Palpatine. \n\nAt the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Darth Vader would appear and become a champion for the Separatists. Vader would kill Dooku at the conclusion of the war along with the remaining Separatist leaders. Officially, Vader and other surviving Separatists would be pardoned by the Republic for their role in the Civil War in the interests of unity. \n\nPalpatine would leak his true identity to the Jedi setting them up. Then Vader would lead the assault on the Jedi Temple proving his loyalty to the Republic.\n\nPadme would join Mon Mothma and Bail Organa in forming, funding, and leading the Rebel Alliance. She would never know that her fiercest foe in Vader was the same boy who had helped her on Naboo. \n\nWithout Luke, the Alliance is destroyed at Yavin. Rebel cells keep popping up, but with the threat of the Death Star, most worlds submit to Imperial authority. Political opponents of Palpatine are eventually killed. \n\nAfter some time, Anakin/Vader grows hungry and kills Palpatine taking the throne for himself. He becomes the Supreme Sith Emperor, learns to cheat death, and reigns as an undisputed Sith Emperor for centuries.",

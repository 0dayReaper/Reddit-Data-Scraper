Yeah, he did a FANTASTIC job for Ep 7, Ep 8 had some memorable tracks, but Ep 9's soundtrack was really disappointing, and I just feel like they just reused the OT tracks WAY too much (ex: the Force Theme) to the point where it just became nauseating. Compare that to the prequels, which had basically wholly original soundtrack (which is dare I say better than even the OT's), and the only themes I can remember them reusing were maybe motifs of the Imperial March for Anakin's evil moments.",

Fallen Order, Rogue One and Solo don't really have that either. The Mandalorian has had some medium-sized stuff, but nothing bigger that I can remember.

Visual diversity was a problem the plagued the sequel trilogy in general.\n\nI\u2019m fully with you on the lack of towns/cities, and it\u2019s something that really bothered me. You can forgive the OT because they were constrained by the technology of the time, so you were stuck with desert planet, ice planet, swamp planet, and forest planet. \n\nBut once that was no longer an issue with the prequel trilogy, you got a planet covered in a bustling metropolis, the beautiful architecture of Naboo, and all of the insane flora and fauna of the other random planets they show. So the galaxy felt big, vibrant, populated, and visually interesting. Lucas went big once he had the technology to do so. \n\nFast forward to the sequels and their slavish adherence to the visual language of the original trilogy, and we\u2019re back to desert planets and forest planets (or whatever the planet was where Maz Kanata\u2019s castle was). And now everything feels sparse, backwater, and just visually boring. Obviously the technology wasn\u2019t an issue anymore, so it just came across as uninspired and lazy. \n\nUltimately, the sequels suffered as a result of this. The conflict between the First Order and The Resistance had no sense of scale. It\u2019s hard to feel like anything is really at stake when all you see are a handful of Resistance fighters going at it with the First Order on a planet with like 12 people on it. No wonder the New Republic and the rest of the galaxy didn\u2019t give a shit about the First Order. All of the action was happening on sparsely populated desert planet #3764 in the middle of nowhere.",

With Alderaan, however:  \n  \n- We hear about it in the opening scenes of ANH, with Leia saying she is \"on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan\".  \n  \n- Luke and Obi-Wan are planning on going there.  \n  \n- Tarkin reveals that Alderaan is Leia's home planet, and Leia starts begging him not to attack it, saying it is peaceful and has no weapons.  \n  \n- We see the horrified reaction from Leia as the planet is destroyed, and Obi-Wan reacting to it through the Force.  \n  \n- When the *Falcon* arrives where Alderaan should be, we see some of the effects of the destruction in the form of large rocks pummeling the ship.  \n  \nThus, we get personal connections between the destroyed planet and named characters. It is baked into the narrative from the very start of the movie, and continues being so until after it's destruction.  \n  \nFor Hosnian Prime, we have absolutely no character connections to it. We see a few seconds from the surface of it, but we have no idea who the characters are, and I'm not even sure if they actually mention the planet name at any point in the movie? Poe does mention the system name, but if you look around online you'll also find a lot of people are/were confused because they thought \"Hosnia\" might have been the star of Coruscant and assumed Coruscant was the planet being destroyed.  \n    \nOn top of that, the reactions are limited to a few moments of shock from characters that, as far as we know, have no real attachment to it, and is cut short by several other things happening at the same time. So not only is the name of the planet not revealed until after the destruction, but we barely get any connection *or* proper reaction to it.",

The fun that they would have playing with BB-8 or Porg toys?  \n\nFor all we love about the films, the series is probably more about them at the end of the day.

I do think that\u2019s why some folks take it so seriously as adults when seeing the sequels or anything new regarding Star Wars.

Given the timeline, Wedge and Lando could easily have been replaced with basically Poe and Finn. Heck, Luke in Dark Empire could basically be replaced with Ben Solo, apprentice of Luke.\n\nReplace Snoke with decaying Palpatine who gets cut down and you see him jump into a new younger/healthier clone body and proceed to mop with floor with the Ben,. possibly leading to a fall to the Dark Side. A little exposition, maybe a little flash back to right after getting tossed down the reactor, and actually seeing him jump bodies pretty much covers the explanation.\n\nRey could probably be adapted to another Jedi apprentice who helps to rescue Ben, save from the Dark Side.\n\nYou could probably even do all that in a movie or two.",

Or that he and Finn went off in separate directions because they couldn't see or hear each other over one plume of smoke.\n\nI swear, people don't give nearly enough shit to TFA.

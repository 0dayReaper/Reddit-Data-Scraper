But it's the only one she bought, she ended up blowing the photo up and hanging it in a prominent spot in the house. \n\n\n\nI loved walking by that everyday.",

Darth Wifeous was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise she could use the Force literally pick up, not just the Groom and Groomsman, but the entire wedding party\u2026 She had such a knowledge of the dark side that she could even keep the ones she cared about from leaving the wedding. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. She became so powerful\u2026 the only thing she was afraid of was your typical average house spider, which eventually, of course, she did find. Fortunately, she taught her Husband everything she knew, then her husband killed the spider, in its web. Ironic. She had all the power to smash the spider, but never could.\n\nEdit- she",

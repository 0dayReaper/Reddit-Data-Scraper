My pc is propped on my desk in the corner with my Ahsoka sabers right about it on the wall and adjacent to my Dark Saber/Maul double sided on the other wall about my monitors. Not to mention my boba fett figuring next to my pc. Plus I need a new SSD, my other one is full after getting into 3D modeling. So first thing I\u2019d do is model a 3D scene of Star Wars probably. I\u2019ve been collecting some scifi/cyberpunk assets to do that anyways",

Red Dead 2 my storage would be full with the other games i have installed) and not only it would be cool to have double the space but also a fast lightning speed SSD from SeagateGaming to play the newest games with almost no loading time just imagine how awsome that is and how it could change my personal experience in games. Also having to install a game over and over again just because i delete it to have more storage is very very boring, just sitting there waiting and waiting and more waiting knowing you are gonna have to uninstall it soon to make up space for a brand new game is pain.",

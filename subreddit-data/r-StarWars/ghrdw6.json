Anakin  would have been some kind of special agent of the Republic while he discovered more about himself and his place in the Force while raising Luke and Leia.",

And in her absence, Representative Binks was the one who gave Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers in the first place. Binks did this as a Representative of Senator Amidala.\n\nI don\u2019t think many would be too comfortable with Padme as a chancellor. They would associate her too much with Palpatine, possibly suspecting if they were somehow connected. I believe even Bail Organa was suspicious of her alliances with Palpatine in the Revenge of the Sith novel before he included her in the Rebellion talks.\n\nIf anyone would be elected as Chancellor, then it would most likely be Bail Organa. I remember back in Episode 1, George named Bail Organa, Bail \u201cAntilles\u201d, although now they\u2019re considered separate characters. Bail Antilles of Alderaan was nominated to be a successor for Valorum, but we all know how that went.",

Basically he became the one to train Anakin, and because of his more liberal views concerning the Force, he was able to help Anakin cope with his emotions rather than try to ignore/bury them. His relationship with Padme was a lot more healthy, and after the Clone Wars he left the order to help raise Luke and Leia. This prompted several dozen other Jedi to also leave, creating a splinter group of Jedi that didn't take everything so seriously. Luke and Leia grew up in this order and learned from Anakin, who was in this group's council, along with Qui-Gon and Ahsoka. Jedi like Yoda and Obi-Wan remained with the original order. There was tension between the two but they would never fight.",

Throw in Sidious turning several force users, and creating an Inquisitor faction as well, with Dooku serving as leader (like Vader and the Empire's Inquisitors). Now there's 3 groups of force users with wildly different philosophies, knee deep in a Galaxy wide conflict.",

Not only were they meddling with politics and galactic affairs, they were \"peacekeepers\" working as a military force for the republic. They made many decisions due to influence from the Chancellor that they wouldn't have likely made otherwise (like expelling Ahsoka from the Jedi order before conducting their own investigation). I'm sure taking direct orders from the Dark Lord of the Sith has led to some questionable actions done by the Jedi (especially since he's secretly manipulating them to seem like the bad guys). \n\nTCW makes it clear by the end that many average people are sick of the war, and many people place their blame on the Jedi. The Jedi's connection to the force had become too clouded to realize they had strayed from their ways.",

She gives Luke the holocron we saw in Rebels of Anakin\u2019s lightsaber training, tells him stories about who his father *really* was.\n\nAnd I hope ghost Anakin appears to her. It would bring that arc full circle and achieve incredible catharsis. I can see him appearing behind her, and her eyes go wide as she detects a presence she hasn\u2019t felt for decades. His body language betrays his shame\u2014he looks at his feet, and glances up as she turns around.\n\n\u201cHey, snips.\u201d\n\nThen we learn just how corporeal force ghosts really are, because Ahsoka reaches out to touch him, unable to believe her senses, and she embraces him.\n\nPerhaps he teaches her the secret of how to maintain her spirit after death (which has to happen at some point, some day). I\u2019d like to think the episode ends with him vanishing, at least for a while, with Ahsoka finally able to move forward, one of the most significant conflicts in her life finally resolved.\n\nCome to think of it, this would be good near the end of the series, as it approaches its climax. If Dave is ever going to kill off his favorite character, that would be a good time to do it, after her deepest, most profound wound is healed. Or it might give her the strength to do something else important. Who know.\n\nI just really wanna see that moment.",

I'll look into fleshing this out more and possibly add in the what-if of Qui-Gon surviving his wounds on Naboo rather than dying from them \n\n&gt;Ahsoka tells Yoda/The Council what Maul knows about Anakin: That he will be the new Sith apprentice. The Jedi however feel this is a trick by Maul and they disregard it until Anakin tells Mace Windu who Palpatine is, to which he summons a meeting with Anakin, Ahsoka, and the rest of the Council. Maul is brought before the Jedi via holotape and reveals all he knows but this angers Anakin because he now knows he was manipulated for years by Palpatine and storms off to confront the Chancellor. Mace and a few other Jedi try to go and stop him and in the mean time, Rex reveals what he knows/theorizes about the inhibitor chips. Anakin battles Palpatine in an extended battle, enough time for Ahsoka and Rex to arrive. The two of them and Mace urge Anakin to stop, that killing Palpatine is not the Jedi way. The Sith Lord then unleashes his Force and electrocutes the four of them while he escapes to execute Order 66 and take a legion of Clones to purge the Temple  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yoda makes success in alerting some Jedi in the field, but failed in reaching many of them; he also alerts the Temple which begins an evacuation of the Younglings but still, several Jedi remain and mount a defense against the marching enemy forces. Obi-Wan defeats Grievous and immediately takes his ship to flee the Clones, rendezvousing with Yoda and other Jedi that received their warnings. At the Jedi Temple, the brave defenders are simply no match for Lord Sidious and are wiped out. The Sith Master comes across Maul who has been enchained and just as he is about to execute his former apprentice, he gives the Zabarak a single chance for redemption. He tells the disgraced apprentice that he must go to Mustafar, wipe out the Separatist leadership, and give the order to shut down the droids. Obi-Wan however receives a vision of his rival on a volcano planet standing over bodies as he is travelling to Yoda.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rex, Anakin, Ahsoka, and Mace awaken but also receive visions of their own with the Jedi Temple burning; they immediately make their way to it and see bodies of clones and Jedi spread out. They deal with a few Clones left behind and head to the communications room where they are able to make contact with Yoda, Obi-Wan, and surviving Jedi. Yoda also brings Bail Organa into the conversation and he informs the Jedi of Palpatine's emergency Senate session and is working to gather senators to oppose Palpatine. Obi-Wan informs the Jedi that he senses Maul on Mustafar and preps to make his journey and Anakin leaves to go find Padme. He tells her all what happened and that she must leave, but she refuses and wants to be at the Senate to stand with Bail. Anakin demands her to leave but she calls in her personal security to have Anakin escorted away.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the Senate, Palpatine goes through his speech but Bail objects with Rex at his side. The Clone informs the Senators what Palpatine has done and how he engineered the Clone Wars to purge the Jedi and take control over the galaxy. This causes an uproar that Palpatine is unable to control so he acts fast. He orders the Clones to secure the Senate building and to flood the chambers and kill all those that oppose him. Anakin, Ahsoka, and Mace then leap into action to save as many Senators as they can while Anakin confronts Palpatine again. Ahsoka helps Padme be rushed to safety and goes back to rescue more. The Jedi and Sith Lord duel once more throughout the impeding chaos On Mustafar, Maul does as he was ordered and awaits further instruction when he sees a ship fly in. He goes out to approach, thinking it is Sidious when Obi-Wan steps out. Shocked, but surprised, Maul takes to this challenge to finally prove he is worthy as a Sith Lord. Obi-Wan wants to bring justice to his former Master and his former love who both died at the hands of Maul.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The two duels occur simultaneously and in the end, both Sith lay defeated and ultimately dead. Obi-Wan and Anakin were tempted by the Dark Side but they conquered these emotions and utilized the goodness in them to vanquish the evil. The Senate building is secured as a detachment of Jedi survivors arrive. Padme suddenly goes into labor and she is transported away to a nearby hospital with Anakin alongside her. Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia while she survives childbirth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the aftermath, the Jedi are made aware of Anakin's violation of the Jedi code with his marriage to Padme, but the Purge has humbled the Jedi. They too realize they violated the Jedi Code with their involvement in the Clone Wars and became blinded by the Dark Side. Anakin is given a pardon and Ahsoka once again is given an offer to rejoin, which she does.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For his bravery, Anakin is granted the rank of Master and given a seat on the Jedi Council  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Luke and Leia become younglings and will be trained as Jedi Yoda revises the Jedi Code to give more freedom for future generations  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bail is elected Chancellor and promptly demilitarizes the Republic and recognizes the sovereignty of the Confederacy  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anakin and Padme begin a new life together on Tatooine where the hate Anakin once had for his homeworld is now gone. Luke and Leia continue their Jedi training. 19 years later, the Skywalkers are preparing for a trip to the Jedi Temple. In a few days, Luke and Leia will be become Jedi Knights while Ahsoka will be made a Master in a grand ceremony. Padme asks Luke where Leia is as they will be departing in a few hours. Luke tells his mother that last he knew, she went out to Mos Eisely. Leia is seen in the cantina ordering a drink when she is approached by a man who couldn't help but notice how pretty she is. He introduces himself as Han Solo.",

They are highly sought after because of their insight, superior education and impartiality. \n\nThe lightsaber is important because it\u2019s a symbol of office and authority. \n\nThe real purpose of the Jedi order is to take highly dangerous and powerful individuals with a connection to a potential mind altering super drug (the force - which can mind control people and influence users down a dark path) and indoctrinate them into a system that edges a greater galaxy as a whole rather than letting them run wild. \n\nIf you fall in love or wish to pursue strong attachments (like children) you after completing your training (defense against the dark side) can give up the lightsaber, authority and power to become a citizen. You can\u2019t hold office or go in a position of power. But you can retire with your loved one and live a wholesome life. I bet a lot of Jedi after their prime years retire to a beautiful planet together registered with the Jedi order so that tabs can be kept up on them. \n\n\nAgain my head cannon as to why the Jedi prohibit attachments.

For example, Eeth Koth retired at some point after being saved from his capture by Grievous during the Clone Wars, maybe due to PTSD from that event or something. Anyways, he lived for a while into the reign of the Empire as a priest of some kind on his home planet. He had a wife, a baby girl, and friends. This was especially significant because he wasn\u2019t just a Padawan or something, he was a Master on the Jedi Council. However, this didn\u2019t last as Vader tracked him down and brutalized him anyways :/",

Anakin was in the scene as well. I think he does do it, but realizes it is a bad habit and tries to impress upon Anakin to not do it as well. Probably picked up such a habit from Qui Gon?",

And it sucks not only because their story ends in tragedy, but because on more than one occasion it could've been prevented. And now I'm forever stuck in this loop of wishing Palpatine was stopped before the fall of the Republic, but knowing that wishing that means none of my favorite Star Wars movies happen.",

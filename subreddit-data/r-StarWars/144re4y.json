    "postText": "I rewatched episode 6 and much of it felt like a preview of what was to come in the prequel trilogy. The lightsaber fights were more like the prequels (the sail barge fight doesn\u2019t feel much like the OT), the inclusion of cute stuff (ewoks) and more slapstick comedy (jabba\u2019s palace) foreshadowed the rise of jar jar and the cgi antics of the prequels. Even the special edition preview coruscant and Naboo",

            "comment": "If anything Ewoks from ROTJ was the reason why people blamed episode 1 to have so many \u201ckiddy\u201d elements.  Personally I still liked episode 1 albeit the slow pacing when I saw it in theaters.  I didn\u2019t think it was amazing but it was pretty cool to see all the different things/aliens/places jammed into that movie.",

            "comment": "This is true. Especially how the portrayal of aliens shifts from the first two films, where they are strange and vaguely threatening almost mythical creatures on the fringes of human society to being more like Star Trek aliens, just regular dudes who often speak English and who are integrated into human society.\n\nIn ANH and ESB aliens mainly fill the roles of creatures in a fairy tale. In everything post-RotJ, they are stand-ins or allegories for different human nations or ethnic groups, just like in Star Trek. At the time the prequels came out this felt pretty jarring and I remember my first reaction was the blame the 1990s novels which had much a more standard sci-fi tone than the original films which were clearly in the fantasy genre. Although a lot of modern fantasy falls into the same trap.",

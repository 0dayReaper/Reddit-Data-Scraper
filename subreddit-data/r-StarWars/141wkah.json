    "postText": "What are they basing this off of and think that it's true? Sure, it could be, I wouldn't mind it or anything, but I feel like people will just be disappointed if it ain't him and say the show sucks cause they convinced themselves that it is Starkiller.  \n\n\nEDIT: Even though I don't think he is gonna be Starkiller, it just wouldn't feel right if he was. Starkiller is suppose to be more powerful than inquisitors and it wouldn't make any sense that he'd be one. Personally, I would prefer if they would do Starkiller, they should make him be some kind of a \"secret agent\" for Vader who only obeyed Vader and no one knew about him, you know, something like they did in games.

I\u2019ve got nothing against the character or TFU, but to bring him into canon would mean changing him so substantially that he is unrecognisable and basically a completely different character. That taken into consideration, why not just make a new character. It\u2019s pointless trying to bring him back, as it would essentially just be an unrecognisable character with the same name. Make a new character (which this inquisitor more than likely will be).",

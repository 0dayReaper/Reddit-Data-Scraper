You need a carton of eggs, milk, bread, and some of those hard toco shells that you bought that one time but can't remember the name of. Anakin liked them, but Ashoka just snacked on them without toppings and ate them all. We need more. They came in a yellow box. May the Force be with you.\"\n\nSeriously though, this looks great. Any plans on making a Sith one?",

And then they brought her to prominence and fleshed her out, which star wars fans love. And they did it by making her a) super interesting and smart, b) have an emotionally compelling storyline/choices to wrestle with, and c) they made her hot. \n\nIt's so simple, presumably what any writer would try to do if they were fleshing out a background character, but for whatever reason they just nailed it with Mon Mothma in Andor.",

She didn't even become a senator until the year Palpatine became chancellor. She was only 26 when the clone wars started and 29 when Palpatine declared the Republic an empire.  By the time the second death star was destroyed, she had spent the last 23 years living under the Empire's rule. Her entire political career was spent with Palpatine as the head of the Republic and it's pretty clear that he began consolidating power pretty immediately. She doesn't think of the Republic having turned into the Empire because it had become ineffectual and dysfunctional because that was something she never experienced. All she knew was a privileged upbringing on Chandrila and then the Senate as it was under Palpatine. She was trying to solve the problem as she'd seen it occur because the political situation that allowed Palpatine to become chancellor in the first place was before her time.\n\nI also think that part of the problem is just that Mon Mothma was ultimately just a bit too soft-hearted to achieve true victory over the Empire. She only accepted the use of military action because she saw no other choice (the lesser of two evils) and once the Empire began to fall apart without the Emperor, all she saw was the suffering that war causes and so she wanted to end the war as quickly as possible because the whole reason she rebelled was to *stop* people from suffering. She's an altruist, not a military leader--which also means that she didn't have the strategic chops to see the possibility  that the Empire could regroup and become a military threat again.",

The Galactic Empire is basically the German Empire, and the First Order is basically the Third Reich. With very similar naming conventions to boot.

Mon Mothma is a really cool and interesting character but I'm gonna be honest, I didn't really care much about her, I thought she was interesting but as a character their wasn't much for me to latch onto (and  I know she appeared in a few comics and novels, which I have read and really enjoyed, but I'm talking strictly shows and films). But then Andor came out and made her one of the main protagonists/supporting characters. She was like the tritagonist (third most important person in a story). And her character and especially acting was absolutely incredible, I found every time she was on screen I was hooked because it was so interesting and the acting of her and every-one around her in those scenes created so much tension that it was incredible. And Andor has pushed her up and made her one of my new favourites and its all mostly thanks to Genevieve O'Rielly's incredible acting that elevated the scenes and her character.",

I love the individual in the role and can't wait to see where her story as essentially the original architect of the rebellion and its financing. With the Luther being her the first military general in the rebellion in my opinion. She's like the prime minister. The complex tires of her political life and familial relationships is just so well done where there is this palpable electricity of curiousity that creeps into you mind beckoning your.

If Anakin lost and Sebulba won, we could have a scene with Qui-Gon and Anakin and co and Watto approaching grinning. Then Qui Gon would do something questionable. He would threat Watto with his lightsaber, which would portray his morally grey side better. In the chaos, Anakin's mother would be taken from the group by local guards as they were trying to escape. That would explain why they couldn't just buy Anakin's mother after TPM and why Anakin would be much more worried about her. All it takes are some little rewrites for AOTC so Anakin finds tge Lars family who bought her later.",

Having Qui-Gon do that would imply that he'd still be giving Anakin little doses of Vader. I don't get the point. Gray Jedi isn't a thing. Qui-Gon doesn't agree with Council dogma but he still serves the light.",

They may try and fool themselves into thinking \"I'm only doing it in certain situations and it's only for the greater good!\" but it will be easier and easier to do things the dark side way. Dooku shows that even super evil Sith can start out with noble intentions. \n\nThere are characters like Cassian and Luthen who do ultimately do evil things for the greater good but both are clearly miserable and losing their soul. It's not the message of Star Wars that truly evil acts of the dark side are perfectly ok and justifiable sometimes. It all comes with a price.  \n\n&gt; what about Oskar Schindler? He was a member of the Nazi party but is very well known for saving 1,200 Jews. Is he a grey Nazi?\n\nI don't know enough about his entire biography but I still doubt I'd call him a gray nazi either way.",

Or, more fun, people just, misunderstood things in the EU and went \"ah, grey jedi!\" without really actually looking at it. That was common too. \n\nLuckily, Canon has people (like Matt and Pablo!) trying a bit more to ensure counter-canon ideas like grey jedi stay out. That's why the mythical \"grey jedi is in now!\" is always sometime in the future, always the next work, and when it fails to canonize grey jedi, they just, keep saying \"next time the messiah will come!\"",

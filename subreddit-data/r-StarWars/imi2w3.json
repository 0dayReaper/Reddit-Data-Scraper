He merged Luke's love/yearn for his father and his desire for adventure with Luke's newfound hatred of Vader. Without Ben's death, Luke basically just wants to be his padawan and emulate Ben and the jedi of old (something he was already doing from the moment he saw a lightsaber). This way, Luke redefined the light. He made the light side something that could accept Anakin and forgive rather than condemn (Obi-Wan's ultimate failure with Anakin on Mustafaar).  By basically fucking off and putting it all on Luke, he unburdened the Force's future from the stereotypes of the past. And then, Vader chooses to do the same by sacrificing himself to kill the Emperor -- he defies the standards of the past sith in a selfless act that wiped out the history of the Sith. I'm not counting the sequel trilogy.",

It's written by the same guy who wrote Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It's called Splinter of the Mind's Eye.

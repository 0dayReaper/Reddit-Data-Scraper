    "postText": "How does it work? Palpatine show Ezra what I think was another universe to get him to help him. Ezra pulled Ashoka in from the past he was going to a save Kanan but Ashoka explained what happens if he\u2019s not there to save them. It\u2019s rumored that the world between worlds will be in the Ashoka series but not used to time travel or at least alter the universe.  So how does it work? Also if it was just his parents in the past why weren\u2019t they confused about him being all grown up?",

The Emperor truly believed he had him at this point, and it was closer than it seemed...which is probably why he reacted so extremely with the lightning and all lol.\n\nThis part of the scene with The Force Theme trying to push through the heavier Emperor's Theme in the music and then \"So be it, *Jedi.*\" will always give me goosebumps no matter how many times I've seen it",

    "postText": "It\u2019s been ages since I watched it, mostly bc I thought I remembered it. I was very wrong.\n\nI need to stop listening to people on here, haha. I forgot how much I really enjoy this movie.\n\nThe part that really stuck with me now that didn\u2019t  when I was younger is Padme\u2019s death. As a mother, I would die in childbirth over losing my child. It\u2019s not even a question. I could see that Padme had the same thought - which is why her death over a seemingly \u201cbroken heart\u201d is so painful. Her children are alive but how can she go on, knowing she is not the person she used to be? I know it can be seen as selfish, leaving these two children alone, but I believe it was the only choice she felt was right. She wouldn\u2019t be the same person, the trauma would eat at her and who knows what her coping would lead to in the end. \n\nI know this may be a controversial take but I get it now. I never saw it as such and to juxtapose it with Anakin\u2019s decisions, its such a tragedy. It makes me more understanding of Ben/Kylo Ren\u2019s decisions - generational trauma is a fucking piece of shit.\n\nAnyways, this is just my take. I\u2019m newer to this sub so I am not really sure what people think of her death. I know what people think of the movies in general but I\u2019m curious to hear what others have to say.",

            "comment": "You know how some old couples pass away not long after one another? They may feel that they have lost their purpose if they were soulmates. Here's where it is complex with Padme and Anakin. I don't think they were soulmates, but I do think that she came to the rapid realization that all that she held dear was now destroyed. \n\nShe had spent so many years of her life fighting a broken system and political career consumed by corruption. Her purpose was justice. The system of democracy and her commitment to the galactic senate meant everything to her. The same corruption that destroyed her passion in life, corrupted her husband, the father of her children. The death of Padme Amidala is also a good metaphor for a death of the republic. As this died, she too, literally died. \n\nI think the stress of losing it all overwhelmed her. Heartbreak can tear your soul apart. The medical Droid states \"medically speaking, she's perfectly healthy.\" I think we can Ina practical sense see how maybe this would be more of a heart attack scenario. She also had her windpipe crushed by force choke. I think the emperor siphoned her health to save Darth Vader.",

            "comment": "&gt; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart.[3] It usually appears after a significant stressor, either physical or emotional; when caused by the latter, the condition is sometimes called broken heart syndrome.[4] Examples of physical stressors that can cause TTS are sepsis, shock, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pheochromocytoma. Emotional stressors include bereavement, divorce, or the loss of a job.[5] Reviews suggest that of patients diagnosed with the condition, about 70\u201380% recently experienced a major stressor, including 41\u201350% with a physical stressor and 26\u201330% with an emotional stressor.[6][7] TTS can also appear in patients who have not experienced major stressors.[8][7]\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy\n\nIt's real and the father of your children becoming a Sith lord after murdering a school full of children would cause an insane amount of stress.",

It's the other two Prequels that are more divisive.\n\nBut yes. Broken heart syndrome is real. And a sad and ironic fact is that Carrie Fisher's real mother also died from it shortly after she died.",

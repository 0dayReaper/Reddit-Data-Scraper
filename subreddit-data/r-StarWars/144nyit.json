Obi-Van left him to burn to death\nFor me it seems like punishment or revenge, coz he left him suffer.\n\nDon\u2019t you have a feeling there that Anakin is acting in the dumbest possible way ?\nInstead of having straight - forward talks with psychotherapist or smb of his friends, he decided to kill everybody.\n\nCase with his mom was weird too.\nHe left her enslaved for 10 years and recall only because of dream.\n\nProbably Jedy\u2019s salary would be enough to buy one slave",

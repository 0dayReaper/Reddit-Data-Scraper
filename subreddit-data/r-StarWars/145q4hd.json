And Legends Sith have survived worse. There was this one Sith Lord who was sliced up so many times his body was behind held together entirely by the Force because he was an even more hateful fuck than Maul.\n\nNote how serene he is while he's actually dying for good. Finally making peace with the fact that someone will defeat Palpatine.",

The beauty of stories is that you can come up with your own story of how and what.  You don't need someone to write that.\n\nIt's really not that big of a deal.",

You must feel very strongly when people complain incessantly about the emperor returning. \n\nAre lightsabers just cauterization sticks now? Jedi just going around cauterizing cuts. Why wasn\u2019t Qui-Gon cauterized? Are there a bunch of half Geonosians flying around after the arena batttle? Jangos head just rolling around the desert after Mace cauterized him? After all, we don\u2019t if the Kaminoians altered him to survive as just a head. I like to think his head attached to that battle droid body 3P0 used. Would still have more explanation in canon than Darth Maul surviving",

The explanation isn\u2019t given in one monologue but over the arch of 4 episodes. \n\nThought dead, Darth Maul survived his injuries by focusing on his hatred of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi who cut him in half. His shattered body was dumped amid the refuse of the junk planet Lotho Minor, where the once deadly warrior fell into madness, staying alive on a diet of vermin. When found by his brother Savage Opress, Maul had no memory of who he was, rambled nonsensically, and had built hideous spider-like legs in place of his severed ones.\n\nThis all takes place in Clone Wars and is explained.",

One that was the start of an awesome, multi-season subplot and one that was the punchline of a series of slaps in the face. Yeah, Palpatine's poorly written return is a twee bit fresher in memory than the trivia you're searching for.\n\nMy recommendation? Watch The Clone Wars. It's an entertaining show, and you'll find your answers sooner rather than later. Don't feel like it? Then scour Wookiepedia. Look at both Legends and Canon; one or both is going to explain how Maul survived outside of TV and film; there are almost certainly novels and/or comics that go into it.",

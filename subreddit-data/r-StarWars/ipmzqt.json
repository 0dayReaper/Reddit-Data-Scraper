I\u2019d encourage everyone to ~~grab the low hanging fruit~~ focus on the basics, like you said, exercise, good diet, avoid sugar etc. \n\n\nBut it\u2019d be naive to claim money doesn\u2019t give you better chances of staying healthy. There\u2019s plenty of data to support that. Having access to healthcare and a quality education are big factors. Having the free time to prepare real meals and exercise are another one. People may say \u201cyou can always make time for things like that, and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re just making excuses\u201d. And many people do. But we\u2019re talking human behavior on a large scale. It\u2019s not -as- easy to make those changes if you don't have money. People work multiple jobs just to put -any- food on the table. 50+% of their paycheck just goes to their rent. Here again people will say \"well I worked two jobs and got through college and maintained a healthy diet and exercise regiment.\" But it's not the -norm- and for a reason. It's harder.",

That\u2019s the armor that he\u2019s in for 20 some years and it never changes. Wich is ridiculous tbh. And I\u2019m happy variations happen. No one in the galaxy would suspect he had more helmets. Or whatever. How could you? So many people thought he was just a monster it\u2019s hard to tell if that\u2019s a man or not. \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ll add about when I was younger. I bought obi wans half truth that I believed he murdered Anakin Skywalker. And eventually my thoughts on that was just this. The dark side twisted his mind into thinking he was 2 separate people and he had to kill Anakin and all of those Anakin loved and ever knew. \n\nTo a degree I guess. But now the way I see this man is just singular. Anakin Skywalker. Through and through. There is no Vader. That\u2019s a facade. A lie he tells himself. And the galaxy bought that lie. And only select few people know this truth.",

Dr. Tolbitz. I hope they cast Jeremy Renner for Mira Tolbitz",

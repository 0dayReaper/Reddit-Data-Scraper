I'm not very fluent in huttese or it's alphabet and need help with writing the initials J C M in huttese. I'd greatly appreciate any help I can get as I'm genuinely excited to make this for him. The \"rough draft\" is below this so if ya'll want to give me any advice or critiques I'm all open if it means helping me make this perfect for him. (The symbols are rough drawings of what I can get from huttese for his initials)",

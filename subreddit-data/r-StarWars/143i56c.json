I mean TECHNICALLY, if a Jedi is immersed in the Force and lets it guide his hands, then sure, his performance with a lightsaber will drastically improve. BUT. That doesn't really substitute for ordinary practice and getting familiar with a weapon through exersise and exertion. \n\nFighting is as much about having your body know what to do on it's own from muscle memory as it is about the Force guiding you and enhancign your senses and reflexes.",

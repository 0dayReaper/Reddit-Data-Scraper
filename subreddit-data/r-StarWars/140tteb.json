I know there\u2019s many books out there and and I prefer chronology so if there\u2019s any recommendations on where to start i\u2019d appreciate it. Also i don\u2019t care if it\u2019s an all new beginning or has characters from film I just wanna start reading from the beginning.",

It's not canon anymore, but as a comic book fan I'm okay with \"alternate\" timelines so that's just been my personal head canon. I'm still early on, but I've really liked it so far. It was where most recommendations told me to start!",

They also should\u2019ve found a way to make it so the more awful things he did like killing the younglings be only after he\u2019s in the Vader suit and after his wife died.",

Luke saw that and proven them all wrong. Anakin pretended to be someone else because he hated himself so much.

I\u2019m prolly be downvoted to hell for this but this is just my personal opinion",

Felt like nearly a word-for-word copy of what Tony Stark and Thanos did at the end of Endgame. When I left the theater, my friends were all saying how it was exactly the same.\n\nWas this a coincidence, or some sort of reference?",

Those films were too close in production. \n\nThe big \u201csurprise\u201d of cap wielding mjolnir though\u2026 awful lot like that moment in force awakens. \n\nOr the Wakanda army in infinity war with their energy shields and big dome protecting them\u2026 big phantom menace vibes there.\n\nBut really, it\u2019s art, it\u2019s pretty much all referenced. And thematically, it\u2019s not like a character declaring \u201cI am ___\u201d in a big moment is a super original thing.\n\nI mean, was succession referencing endgame when Kendall cried \u201cI am the eldest boy?\u201d",

First I watched The Phantom Menace, then a couple years later I watched The Rise of Skywalker, then I watched season 1 of The Mandalorian. From 8 days ago to Today I watched the main Star Wars Saga from Episode 1 to 9, and tomorrow I will start the spinoffs. I want to know how other fans got into the Star Wars movies, shows video games, or lore.",

Watched all the sequels in cinemas but never really gave a second thought to them.\n\nThen one day after school in 2019, the rise of Skywalker trailer 2 popped up on my YouTube recommended, in which you can clearly hear Palpatine talking. I immediately recognised the voice despite my 6 year \"break\" and it gave me chills to the bone. This was about 2 months before it came out.\n\nNow I'm not a fan of that film and the sequels as a whole, but after that trailer i rewatched or watched everything there was to do with star wars. That trailer pulled back that 10 year old me and he's never left since.",

Didn't care for Star Wars or even knew what it was so gave it away to another kid\n\nFew months later, The [Star Wars Trilogy arcade game was installed down at the Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiswEP7-z-A). I still knew nothing about Star Wars but thought the game looked cool so i played it. Every time i came back to that arcade for what felt like over a year, i'd always play it even though i didn't know who anyone was or what was going on. But i still spent tons of my allowance playing it\n\n1999- For some reason all of my Breakfast Cereals kept giving me these[ Star Wars mini Bust collectible things](https://cerealoffers.com/Kelloggs/Coco_Pops/1996-99/Star_Wars_Episode_1_Statuettes/1999-Coco-Pops-Star-Wars-Phantom-Menace-Statuettes1.jpg) as they were promoting Phantom Menace. I vividly remember getting the Padme and Jar Jar one's specifically, but i never connected them to the Star Wars brand, so chucked em away in the bin as soon as i got em. \n\n2000- Early in the year, a friend brought round Episode 1 on VHS and wanted me to watch it. I borrowed it and i vividly remember that night as i was watching it. Pitch black at night but with crisp air coming in through the open doors (as my parents were in the Garden talking to eachother for hours). But i remember getting my mind blown by what i was seeing and loved that world\n\nLater that year i was on holiday and i brought my own copy of Episode 1 with me. I remember watching it again in the Villa and texting the friend who lent me Episode 1 on VHS. During our texting, he told me to watch 4, 5 and 6. I asked: \"What about 2 and 3?\" And he said: \"Not out yet\". Which just confused the hell out of me as much as it excited me. Equal parts made me wonder why they would jump to episode 4 after making episode 1, but then it felt exciting and unique to have a 6 movie franchise where movies 2 and 3 were still hypothetical and anything could happen in that gap. When i got back, that friend gave me the VHS boxset of the Originals to watch.\n\nAs i was watching them though, all the memories of the arcade game i played years earlier just flooded back to me as i was being like: \"Oh, I remember that\" and \"Thats what that was!?\". When i got to Episode 6 though, i don't remember what happened. I remember starting to watch it. Then my memory just jump cuts to being outside playing in the Garden, and then coming back in to being surprised episode 6 was still playing. I must've gotten bored and went outside, but i don't remember. I eventually watched it the whole way through at a later date through\n\nI then watched 2 and 3 in the cinema. Episode 2 with the friend who got me into Star Wars, and Episode 3 with a different friend who i had introduced to Star Wars",

Being 5/6 years old it was like what the hell are you talking about. that was my first introduction. \n\nwhen I got a year or 2 older someone mentioned it so I was like alright lets watch it so I think my parents bought me the box set on VHS. watched it loved it. \n\nin 1995 96 (I think) I was like 10 and they re-released the original trilogy into theaters and my mom took me. it was amazing seeing it on the big screen with the surround sound. It was also a rarity to go out like that cause my mom was going through cancer treatments around the same time so it was kind of an emotional connection starting to build also. \n\nThe original trilogy came out as I was hitting teenhood and being a broke teenager really didn't get a chance to see them in theaters also there were sports to be played and friends to hang out with. then in 2004/5 I just started college and RotS released on DVD and a friend bought it and goes you need to watch this. so I put it in and was transfixed to the screen, it was fricking amazing, I actually missed a couple of classes because I rewatched it multiple times. Then I started to read the books and get into the expanded universe. \n\nThats pretty much my origins.",

I wasn't quite 4 yet, but my foster home had that on a loop. I can't remember the first time I watched it, and I certainly didn't sit down for a focused viewing of the whole thing until I was a bit older. So my introduction was more like osmosis.\n\nThat my foster parents had the score on a loop whenever the movie wasn't on (or Reeve's Superman)  certainly helped. \n\nInterestingly Empire initially passed me by. I had seen toys, but the movie came to theaters when I was not quite 2, and didn't come to home video until after Return of The Jedi hit theaters.\n\nBut RETURN OF THE JEDI \n\nMy God. That was my jam. I was almost 5, and the perfect age to appreciate everything. That was the first Star Wars movie I paid full attention to in theaters, got many action figures, had the bedding set, became an Ewok connoisseur, the works. \n\nNever got into the EU, though I had friends who were.  It was either a little too Star Trek (which I also love, but don't need Star Wars to be) or too fantasy- they never hit that balance for me.\n\nYou might think that being raised on the OT, I might have hated the prequels- nah son. I loved those too. And defended them during the massive backlash.\n\nAnd now I find myself doing the same for the sequels, which I also love, and hit that sweet spot for me that the EU didn't.",

To this day the opening scene and first battle aboard the blockade runner is my favourite scene. So for Star Wars has literally been a part of my whole life!

Then a year later the Special Edition came out and Star Wars merch was everywhere and I was a fan\n\nreally as a kid I was kind of generally a fan of anything space related, I probably watched a lot more Star Trek than Star Wars until well into the PT era",

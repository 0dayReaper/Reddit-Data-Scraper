She's an executive producer and president of Lucasfilm. Her creative input is mostly making hiring and budget decisions. She's literally Jon and Dave's boss when it comes to Lucasfilm. She is the one who is putting them on projects. If she actually disagreed with them on anything or didn't trust their judgement, she could literally just take them off of the projects and hire yes-men.\n\n&gt;5) there planning on making a thrawn trilogy and other parts of legends into movies and series\n\nThey are *adapting* probably a few ideas of Heir to the Empire into Ahsoka and eventually Dave Filoni's movie. There's also already 2 canon Thrawn novel trilogies and he was a featured villain in Rebels.",

She's their third highest earning director (i.e., her assigned departments are the 3rd highest earning in the company). The only people beating her out are the executive managing Disney World Parks and Kevin Feige. \n\nThere is a reason they keep promoting her and giving her pay raises. As a general rule, if you're listening to someone that's bashing on KK, then they're part of the toxic angry fan part of the community or they are a misogynist dork. KK is the person responsible for putting David Filoni and Favaro in charge of basically everything--she is getting credit for all of their good work b/c it was her decision to put them on their projects. KK is a manager--she has never had a creative role in Star Wars at any point.",

It took me about six months but after continually telling it I didn't like certain channels, it finally learned and stopped serving me the bad stuff. \n\nAt this point, I kill any channel that brings up politics (even politics I agree with) because it trains the algorithm that I don't like politics at all. That's how I got rid of the toxic element of the fan base. It does have the impact of removing some sources that I would like and whose politics aren't a problem...but that is a small price to pay to get rid of the other side of things, which tends to be much more common. And there is no shortage of fan content out there for Star Wars, so I'm happy to reward smaller creatives that stick to the material and leave the larger world out of their analysis.\n\nNot sure if this will help you or not, but happy to help in any way I can.",

            "comment": "&gt;1) is KK getting fired based on the performance of Indiana johns which is doing bad\n\nThe film hasn't been released yet so use some common sense on this one. The key metric here is profit and not rotten tomatoes score, and we won't know how much money it makes till after it releases. In the very unlikely event her future is hinging on the success of this film then they're not going to make a decision till they see how it affects the share price.\n\n&gt;2) are they making an old republic series with keanu reeves\n\nGiven lucasfilms propensity to announce projects before they're off the ground, it's inconceivable they'd have got as far as casting a major star before officially announcing the project\n\n&gt;3) they are planning on changes to cannon using the WBW in asoka like luke having another temple\n\nWishful thinking from the irrationally angry sections of the fandom\n\n&gt;4) after KK ruined several of the series she now has no creative control on asoka and other shows which are all under the control of John and have\n\nOk you really need to change your source of star wars \"news\" as you're listening to either a rage baiter or fantasist. I don't claim to know the inner workings of lucasfilm but I know how companies operate. KK has no more or less creative control than she ever did. She green lit the shows you dont like but also green lit the ones you did. Don't let anyone fool you into believing that the shows you like were somehow snook into production on KKs day off or something. And yes, shock horror, favreau wasn't forced to write BoBF at gun point, he gets as much blame for that as he does credit for the mandalorian.\n\n&gt;5) there planning on making a thrawn trilogy and other parts of legends into movies and series\n\nThis is the closest to having some truth to it. We know Thrawn is going to be an antagonist in Ahsoka, he's been name dropped in the mandalorian and we know one of the planned films is going to tie into these shows, so while we have no details, Thrawn being the part of said film is possible, and since he's originated in legends then by defenition it's adapting an element of legends. No hint it's going to be a trilogy though.\n\nI guess it's good you're not just blindly swallowing all of this, but seriously, stop watching/reading whoever it is that's feeding you this shit",

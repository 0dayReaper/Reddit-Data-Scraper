He is an interesting character, but the ability to completely decipher individual actions by looking at art and cultural objects is ridiculous. \n\nMy own - I am a huge fan of the Galen Marek/Starkiller character. Yes he was super OP in the games, but those are over the top game mechanics, and he is much less powerful in the books. He has a interesting story of a force user who only used the darkside because it was all he knew and was brought up by an abusive master, but still found redemption.",

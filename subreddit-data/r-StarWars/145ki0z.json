It's made to act like real swords, just coming out when needed.\n\nI don't pretend to know the technology Like, how does it know how far to go out?  Is one energy field or several tiny ones?  Why does Kylo Ren have it on his hilt?  Does that do anything special other than the possibility his hand might slip and cut off his fingers?",

Some alien species. Cortosis. To a lesser degree Beskar. But even a cortosis wall could eventually be cut by a lightsaber. It's just inefficient to do so when there's other methods available.",

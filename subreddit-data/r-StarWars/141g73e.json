    "postText": "Curious what the Star Wars community would say about how the story would go with a female Anakin. I don't know how many things would be different but I would keep some things the same. Obi and Qui-Gon still find a young Ani on Tatooine, but she doesn't call Padme an angel no matter how pretty she is. This isn't to say she won't think she's beautiful and will lead her to think about Padme in the time between episodes 1 and 2. But Femani would be less awkward and would not blurt out things when meeting Padme again.\n\nIt's a long discussion but I was curious what the general consensus would be.",

Totally delete if not! \n\nHaving a birthday party for my daughter in August and looking for reputable/not sketch cosplayers or character actors to come surprise her! Obviously will pay. I CANNOT find anywhere else to search. A friend recommended reaching out to the local 501st and cosplay groups buuut I\u2019ve come up with nothing. She adores Chewie, Vader, Ahsoka, Troopers, and Grogu. If anyone has any tips or even some good costume recs I can get my husband and his brother into would be very helpful! \n\nThanks!",

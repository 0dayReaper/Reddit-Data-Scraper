When I was watching the final episode of Mando S3 and saw the new house of Din Djarin and Din Grogu, I knew straight away that I wanted to construct it as a lego moc. It took me around one or two days to build and has about 2500 Lego pieces (the majority of which are the mountains in the distance) and i created it in the studio 2.0 program.  note: this moc was completed on 04/21/2023 but I'm posting it now on Reddit.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[this is the lego moc](https://preview.redd.it/nx8n9appus4b1.jpg?width=2094&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=48e1e3972f5b50e596abb5afd7886c0a4a449271)\n\n[this is the picture i used as reference image](https://preview.redd.it/t4zywndous4b1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b3232eee4c876fd02a8e39d6fe3e795f20248e64)",

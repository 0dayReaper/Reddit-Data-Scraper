    "postText": " Hi All,\n\nThe subreddit will be restricted on June 12th &amp; 13th..  No new posts will be allowed during that time.  This was chosen instead of going private so people can see this post, understand what is going on and be able to comment and discuss this issue.  \n\nThis is in protest of Reddit's policy change for 3rd Party App developers utilizing their API.  In short, the excessive amount of money they will begin charging app developers will almost assuredly cause them to abandon those projects. More details can be seen on this post  [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).\n\nThe consequences can be viewed in this [Image](https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg)\n\n[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) is the open letter if you would like to read and sign.\n\nPlease also consider doing the following to show your support :\n\n* Email Reddit:  contact@reddit.com or create a [support ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to communicate your opposition to their proposed modifications.\n* \u200bShare your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue.\n* \u200bShow your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th.\n\n\u200b3rd party apps, extensions, and bots are necessary to the day-to-day upkeep and maintenance of this subreddit to prevent it from becoming a real life wretched hive of scum and villainy.  \n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience, we believe this is for the best and in the best interest of the community.\n\nThe r/StarWars mod team",

Therefore, they cannot afford to piss off their volunteer moderators.",

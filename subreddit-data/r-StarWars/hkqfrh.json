The biggest issue is perspective and proportions, the debris in the area are too similar and the size is equal to the size of the troopers when it should be either smaller or much larger and with more variety than what surrounds the troopers.  Go outside and look around, take note of how you measure up to your surrounding (rocks, small twigs under your feet or large branches and of course large trees. Those proportions are what you need to recreate to find your authentic image.\n\nIn all but the most technically complex photo compositions, fixing the image before its captured by fixing the light, the subjects position and the background are far easier and will produce a better product every time.  It doesn\u2019t matter if your shooting houses, landscapes, portraits, or sports, there is only so much you can fix later.\n\nI have seen several photographers who got there start doing similar portraits of action figures.  They now earn enough money to support themselves and have been some of the most inventive photographers I\u2019ve ever seen.  \n\nWhen things are that small, the limits of possibilities are smaller and options are larger, so dream big!",

I\u2019m only 14 so I understand his want for support and compliments  but I think that age is irrelevant. I see the \u201cpity upvotes\u201d a lot in all communities and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. People are saying that it\u2019s pathetic for adults to hate on kids which in some cases is true, however I think age is irrelevant here. I feel that it happens with women as well. In many subreddits that are mostly directed towards guys, you will sometimes see posts that standout just because op put \u201cfemale\u201d in the title. Not to take away from the talent of these people but they are average posts that stand out for a pretty obvious reason. Sorry to rant but I\u2019m just trying to address all comments at once.",

That leads into the couple of suggestions I have for you:\n\nIf you are willing to alter your storm troopers, you might dirty up their armor ever so slightly. Sprinkle some black marks across them, or even just put some pepper. It will simulate dirt and  shrapnel that may have come from the attack/fall.\n\nThe only other major suggestion I might add is to remember that the bad guys don't always fall backwards. Maybe dig just enough to make it look like the one in the back fell forward, or at an angle.\n\nI would love to see you do more in the future, because this was really nice.

            "comment": "I doubt Disney will sell star wars to anyone. With the success of The Mandalorian, Clone Wars season 7, and Andor along with the merch sales they've got, they've finally recouped their losses and earned back beyond what they spent on buying the franchise and whatever it cost to make the shows and films. If anything, I can see Lucasfilm moving a new direction and possibly replacing Kennedy within the next 1-2 years, but at this point, Lucasfilm is locked into Disney's company for life.",

You can only make that argument if you pare the story down to it\u2019s absolutely most basic - Ahsoka is in hiding, saves someone with the Force, Inquisitor shows up, she kills him, leaves with Bail. The short tells that set of beats in a very different, frankly inferior way with characters who have less depth and plot beats that are way less interesting. In the book theres a duo of sisters that Ahsoka slowly befriends, they become rebels and fight the Empire, and one of them has a doomed to failure crush on Ahsoka (incidentally the first LGBTQ canon book character) while the other is a hothead but gets along very well with her sister. In the book, they\u2019re captured by the Empire after literally fighting it with homemade, improvised explosives, and Ahsoka using the Force and choosing to reveal herself to rescue them is what brings the Inquisitors. Very different from the short where there\u2019s no real relationship between Ahsoka and the girl she saves, who is in danger not from Imperials due to rebellion, but instead is in danger from some falling bales of hay because her brother (who was a sister in the book) is a dunce who won\u2019t listen to her obviously correct advice. \n\nThe short both changes the inciting incident into something very mundane, compared to the drama of building a rebel cell, fighting, and failing, and also eliminates Ahsoka\u2019s agency as a character. In the short, she has to make a split second decision to reveal herself and save someone. Afterwards, she hides it and has to downplay it to the villagers but the brother still rats them to the Empire. In the novel, Ahsoka has time to think and makes a deliberate choice to reveal herself, under much more serious circumstances, and instead of locals ratting her out, the Empire is portrayed as scary and competent \u2014 an Inquisitor is there almost immediately, and they slaughter a big chunk of the nascent rebel cell, who we\u2019ve spent time getting to know. Like another commenter said, the short absolutely butchered the story.",

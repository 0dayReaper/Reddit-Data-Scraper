The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\n\nOutside of videogames, (and Legends lore) there aren't many demonstrations of Force power that could rival the ability to destroy a planet. Lots of fancy lightsaber swinging, acrobatics, moderate telekinesis... Dragging a whole ship down while it's flying away is definitely an order of magnitude above those, so its nice Vader can back up his claims.",

                            "comment": "Nah, there were plenty of mistakes made by the order. Here are a few:\n\n1) Permitting the training of Anakin despite the head of the Jedi council saying \u201cgrave danger I fear in his training\u201d. Mace Windu also agreed that the boy should not be trained.  Then don\u2019t train him!\n\n2) Assigning Anakin to be head of security of Padme, someone whom he is obviously completely infatuated with. C\u2019mon, why wasn\u2019t Obi-Wan on top of that?!\n\n3) Mace Windu announcing \u201cwe will discover the identity of your attacker\u201d. Nope. Not sure they even tried. Never discussed again. No investigation of a possible Sith return performed.\n\n4) Mace Windu saying out loud \u201cI sense a plot to destroy the Jedi\u201d more than once. And no one did a single thing about it.\n\n5) Mace Windu saying \u201cit\u2019s very dangerous putting them together\u201d (referring to assigning Anakin to spy on Palpatine). Then don\u2019t! Don\u2019t put them together! Have someone else spy on the chancellor. Get an actual spy to do it. Not some overly dramatic and emotionally unstable padawan. This. Was. A. Mistake! \n\n6) The Jedi council poorly investigating Ahsoka\u2019s \u201ctreason\u201d, thereby driving her away forever. \n\n7) Yoda being 800 years old, super wise, but always being so incredibly confused about everything all the time. What good is this guy anyway? He offered nothing in the way of actual council through the entire PT. He was a way better character in the OT.\n\n8) Anakin marrying Padme under the Jedi council\u2019s nose, and then impregnating her without any of their knowledge. Again\u2026 Obi-Wan, how are you not on top of that? Are you blind? The council obviously has incredibly loose accountability. \n\n9) The Jedi council never questions or investigates the creation of the clone army, that was supposedly ordered by a deceased former Jedi. This is probably the most baffling thing of the entire saga, and the greatest mistake the Jedi ever made. \n\n10) The Jedi appointing their knights and masters to engage in warfare, and allowed them to become generals over the republic\u2019s military. This has always been such a baffling decision to me. On more than one occasion the Jedi say that they are \u201ckeepers of the peace\u201d, not \u201csoldiers\u201d. Ahsoka even calls herself a \u201csoldier\u201d. What do the Jedi even know of military tactics and the waging of war? Appointing them to such high authority also leaves them open to potential corruption. \n\n11) The Jedi council trained Anakin because of a prophecy that they did not take seriously. See all items above concerning Anakin. If he was their future savior, then he should not have been so poorly trained by a master who drove him away through harsh criticism, and lack of accountability. He should not have been given so much freedom to do the things he did, including killing an entire tribe of Sand People, thereby ushering in the dark side. Did Yoda even follow up with Obi-Wan concerning his padawan after he sensed \u201cincredibly pain\u201d during that event? \n\nI could probably include more, but I think this is probably enough for now.",

I just can\u2019t place which scene\u2026.I think the scene where Anakin and Obi-Wan are chasing Zam. Yeah that\u2019s it. Gotta listen side by side. Sounds very similar. If this is old news, my bad lol",

There could have possibly been some inadvertent influence.\n\nTo me *Rey's Theme* from the Sequel Trilogy sounds like it could have been an early version of a theme for the Harry Potter movies that John Williams filed away for later use. Not that there's anything wrong with that if that's actually what happened. It's a really good piece of music.",

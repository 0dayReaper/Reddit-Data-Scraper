Like, are they just actively trying to deconstruct Star Wars and reduce it to a political talking point and nothing more than a tab on a streaming service app?",

I don't care if he's friends with racists. It's beside the point.\n\nBut he's a drama queen. After the theory videos dried up and he has nothing to breakdown, he moonlights as a Star Wars journalist with no discipline, integrity or responsibility that comes with being a journalist.\n\nIf he honestly wanted to understand what she meant, he would have found the source clipped and bothered to understand what The Auteur Myth was before pressing record on his webcam to spend 20 minutes ranting and reacting to a 90 second clip and not bothering to do ANY additional research.\n\nYou understand what I mean here?",

That\u2019s YouTube, not going to get a balanced opinion when that\u2019s your job. \n\nStar Wars is more than one man. Film is a collaborative effort. Particularly the OT with 3 directors and an army of the brightest minds in cinema at the time. I get what she was saying. \n\nFor many of you, Star Wars is not for you anymore, and no amount of online complaining will fix that. We are 11 years into Disney\u2019s ownership, 5 movies, 10 shows, numerous books and comics, and billions of dollars later. If you don\u2019t like it, why not simply let go. If this goes on another 10 years, I won\u2019t be done with Star Wars, but I\u2019ll definitely stay far away from the community. \n\nThat all said, this is a show I am very excited for. Hope it is fresh and good. Whenever Kennedy retires I\u2019ll owe her thanks for what will probably be 15 year of Star Wars. Lucas 1977-2012 (35 years). Kennedy 2012-20? If she goes 20 years I\u2019ll be impressed. I assume she will stop at 15. She is 70, and I\u2019d imagine she\u2019d like to retire at some point. I don\u2019t know who would take the job after her.",

I\u2019m not fond of the auteur\u2019s theory and absolutely believe that there are far more people responsible for making Star Wars what it is than just Lucas. \n\nSo what if she criticizes the prequels? When did we start pretending those films weren\u2019t met with a quite negative reception? And let\u2019s also not pretend like one of the most common complaints of the prequels was that nobody telling Lucas \u201cno\u201d and essentially him not collaborating as much as previous films. \n\nLike how many times have you heard someone say something along the lines of Lucas is a brilliant idea man, but he\u2019s not the strongest director or that he\u2019s not the best with dialogue or working with actors, etc \n\nAlso, these comments didn\u2019t come out today, they\u2019re about 4 years old. And listening to this segment of the interview in full context, what she\u2019s saying makes sense. Ralph McQuarrie fundamentally shaped what Star Wars is. George Lucas has said the same thing.",

They absolutely did make something new; the sequel trilogy\u2019s story was completely incoherent and had no interesting arcs for our main heroes rey and finn. These are huge breakthroughs that were never seen in the previous trilogies. We also got to see Jake Skywalker tempted to kill his nephew in his sleep, then lose hope and live as a hermit, those were fresh takes!",

Its not ok to assume someone had zero training when in fact you can clearly see them being trained in the movie. \n\nLuke was shooting down stormtroopers and blowing up deathstars with no training. Not a problem for some reason. And he was a farmboy who was never in a fight in his life. \n\nBut when Rey (a girl who was in fights her whole life) manages to win by opening herself to the Force and defeat a guy who is emotionally unstable (Even Snoke points this out) and bleeding to death then she's a Mary Sue.\n\nThat's disingenuous to me.",

Im talking about what we see.\" George literally wrote that Luke spent years between each OT film training, with Obi-Wan's force ghost and then finishing his training with Yoda. But because this silly kid doesn't like it, he's just gonna respond with \"wehhhh I don't careeee, rey is not a shit mary sueeeee\". Hillarious argument.\n\nIf only onscreen stuff counts, then Rey is not a young woman, she's only 2 hours old in TFA. That's the type of logic you're rolling with. Please, get help. Also according to your logic, no Rey had no fighting experience before TFA, since it did not happen onscreen. Poe also never flew a fighter until the beginning of TFA, since it never happened onscreen. Kylo Ren also never dueled anyone before Finn and Rey, it was his very first duel, since none of his other duels happened onscreen.",

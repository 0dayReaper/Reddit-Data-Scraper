    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019m unraveling a conspiracy theory or something\u2026\n\nDoes anyone know what was the original story behind what was going on with the dynamic duo\u2019s sabers in episode 3?\n\nOk. Grievous takes them and they take them right back. The hilts after they take them back are their correct hilts. \n\nFast forward to \u201cHello there\u201d and Obi Wan appears to be using his saber (it\u2019s hard to tell.) \n\nThe scene where Grievous pulls out his 4 sabers, Obi has a different hilt. Grievous\u2019 right arms are\u2026 Obi and Anakin\u2019s saber? (Anakin\u2019s has a green blade though throughout the fight it sometimes switches to blue.)\n\nCan\u2019t really tell which hilt Obi uses when he fights Grievous but the second arm Kenobi destroys is has his own hilt falling to the ground. \n\nWe don\u2019t see Obi pick up his saber which fell from Grievous, but when he drops a saber which Cody picks up, it\u2019s his. No explanation what happens to Anakin\u2019s saber. \n\nAnakin\u2019s saber teleports and is actually held by Palpatine in some scenes during the Windu fight. \n\nAnakin uses his own saber to cut off Windus hand. \n\nAnakin keeps his saber and Obi Wan keeps his until they fight. \n\nThe scene where Anakin is choking Obi WAN during their fight, the saber in Obi\u2019s hand switches hilts between shots of Anakin\u2019s is the further away shots and Obi Wan\u2019s in the close up shot. Later Anakin knocks saber from Obi Wans hand and then they both force grip their correct sabers and they keep their correct sabers for the rest of the movie. \n\nNow you COULD chalk all that up to continuity errors, but does anyone have any more in depth knowledge of what\u2019s going on? \n\n\nHere\u2019s my theory of what originally was planned:\n\n1)Grievous steals their sabers and was originally supposed to get away with them. \n\n2)Obi Wan gets them back when he kills Grievous \n\n3)Obi Wan is supposed to have returned to Coruscant and returns Anakin\u2019s saber. \n\n4)Obi Wan was supposed to be doing something else when Palpy vs Windu fight was happening. \n\n5)Anakin was actually involved in Palpy vs Windu fight and I guess Anakin sides with Palpy during the fight which is why he is using his saber or else Anakin starts the fight against Palpy and then as it goes on he loses his saber to him. (Side theory: Since it could have been Anakin\u2019s saber that Palpy loses out the window, maybe Anakin was originally supposed to have Vader saber during Order 66 and for the rest of the movie, though there are some issues with the theory like \u201chow would Obi Wan have gotten Anakin\u2019s saber for Luke in episode 4\u201d? A good question\u2026 for another time\u2026 \ud83d\ude11)\n\n6)Deleted scene during Obi Anakin fight where Obi loses saber and somehow gets Anakin\u2019s. \n\nAnyway, if anyone wants to post a theory or actually has \u201cmaking of\u201d knowledge they got from a commentary or something, I\u2019d be very grateful to read your comments.",

They've already got the sabers available so why on earth would they design other ones for something 99% of people will never notice or care about? Esp. when they're only going to be there for a  incredibly short time, you'll notice that the team said \"nah fuck that\" and got greivous down to something much less excessive after the money shot and quickly moves away from that even soon after as well. \n\n&gt; Anakin\u2019s saber teleports and is actually held by Palpatine in some scenes during the Windu fight.\n\nThis is caused by a change in the Office showdown sequence where initially Anakin was present from the start and Palpatine was using his saber, you can see BTS and deleted stuff where Anakins just sorta moping around as it happens, when they changed the sequence they took the simple out of just changing the coloring and figuring 99% of people would either not notice or not care anyways.\n\n&gt; The scene where Anakin is choking Obi WAN during their fight, the saber in Obi\u2019s hand switches hilts between shots of Anakin\u2019s is the further away shots and Obi Wan\u2019s in the close up shot.

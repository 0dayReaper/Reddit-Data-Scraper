The directors are best friends and it was a bit of a nod to each other that they did stuff like that.\n\nThere's a plane that starts up in the 2nd film I think it is and the engine firing sound is the same as a tie fighter shooting iirc. And when Jones is wading through water in an underground crypt there's the sound of an ewok. Ford even looks at the thing making the noise and pulls a funny face.",

It wasn't as easy to get new recordings for each movie, so it made sense to just have a really clean recording of \"animal roar #5\" or whatever and if a film needed an animal roar they'd use it. The most famous example is the Wilhelm Scream. Star Wars had innovative sound design, but they still used stock sounds for some of the more mundane things.\n\nOnce you hear some of the stock sounds there is no unhearing them. I wish they'd retire the Wilhelm Scream because it's so freaking distracting. There's also this generic wolf howl I keep hearing in everything that drives me absolutely nuts.",

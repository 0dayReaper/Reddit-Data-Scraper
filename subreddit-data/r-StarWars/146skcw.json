    "postText": "Say Mace Windu orders Shaak Ti to evacuate the temple if he and the other Jedi are not back in a few hours or she feels their deaths in the Force. \n\nSo Shaak Ti, when she senses Mace and the other's deaths, immediately orders all younglings and Padawans be evacuated from the temple immediately. Obviously they wouldn't all be able to get out on time, but say by the time the 501st and Anakin make it to the temple, most of the Padawans and younglings have already made it out of the temple amd it's just filled with knights and masters knowing something bad was about to go down in the temple",

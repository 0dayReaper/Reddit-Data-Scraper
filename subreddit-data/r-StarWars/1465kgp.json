    "postText": "CONTROVERSY ALERT! But hear me out.\n\nFrom the dawn of time, mankind's weapons were developed with one purpose in mind: poke holes in the enemy so they leak to death. Spears, swords, shrapnel, and so on. But lightsabers do the opposite: they instantly cauterize every wound they make. So if you're trying to kill your enemy, you essentially have to behead them, or stab them precisely through the heart, to get the job done. Lopping off limbs is no guarantee of fatality (in fact, it kind of seems like the opposite). Even literally cutting your enemy in half will just result in them coming back a few years later with robot legs or something.\n\nNow, you could argue that Jedi, being honorable knight types, use lightsabers precisely because they would rather disable their foes than kill them. But Sith use them too, so that can't be it.\n\nI think blasters might have the same problem? As do phasers in Star Trek, to be fair, but in that case they really ARE being used by space hippies who would prefer a non-lethal outcome. (Plus they have 'kill' and 'vaporize' settings, which presumably use technobabble to make leaky holes unnecessary for fatal outcomes.)\n\nIn the galaxy of lightsabers, the man with the pointy stick is king.",

So in the rare instance that a Jedi kills, it is done to send the message that it was EXTREMELY intentional, and because the alternatives were simply not feasible.",

            "comment": "I wouldn't totally agree here. Stabbing someone in the abdomen near vital organs, even if the wound is immediately cauterized, would still likely kill someone. Also, I think one of the main reasons lightsabers are so amazing is because they're going to destroy any other short range weapon they come in contact with. You charge a lightsaber with a metal sword and that fight is over in 1 second. Similar with every armor but Beskar.\n\nYour argument is talking about saber vs saber combat and I'd agree. But you have to broaden the scope and look at all weapons and defenses to see how effective they really are.",

            "comment": "So the detail about lightsabers is that any wound  is a serious wound. Slice the Achilles muscle down they go. Stab anywhere in the chest and there\u2019s an organ now with a hole and missing a chunk of itself. They tend to quit working at that point. Also there\u2019s the medical condition of shock. Body knows that something ain\u2019t working and seizes up. \n\nJedi use them because they\u2019re clean. As you said cauterizes and doesn\u2019t kill if used in their way.\n\nSith like causing pain. Dismemberment will be painful. Having hot holes in you is also painful. \n\nAnd the they both use the force to stop physical projectiles and even energy ones. So what\u2019s the point of using a bullet if it can be stopped by the force? And the lightsaber disintegrates the ones you don\u2019t feel like stopping. Last point a beam of light doesn\u2019t break. Or dull. Or snap off after stabbing a dude. And lastly it\u2019s hard pulling swords and spears out of people. They get stuck in bones and tissue. Lightsaber? Just keeps going or slides right out. And ain\u2019t no one grabbing it to keep you from getting away like all the heroic death grapples you see in movies. Put your hands on that blade and they ain\u2019t bleeding. They\u2019re just gone",

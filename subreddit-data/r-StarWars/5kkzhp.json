It was a great costume, and this person must have been close to seven feet tall.  When Carrie saw this person, she said, \"I have to get a picture with this!\"  The convention staff wasn't very happy about this, because they were reminding people every few minutes that there were no photos at the table, but they knew better than to argue with her.  Before anyone realized what she was doing, she put one foot on her chair, and then leapt up onto the wobbly folding table to be eye-level with Vader.  The staff started to run from every direction, panicked.  She waved them off, yelling, *\"It's fine.  He's my father!\"*\n\nShe will always be royalty to me.",

It was the last day, on the last hour of the event and I was the last one in a queue to get her autograph. As I was about to greet her, someone tapped on my shoulder, it was Femi Tayler, the dancing Twi'lek, asking me if she could get before me and hug Carrie. They were so happy to see each other it was a real pleasure to witness that. \n\nA few minutes later, still very happy, Carrie Fisher greeted me with a huge grin and, pushing a box of cookies, told me to take one. As I politely declined, she waved her hand like a Jedi and told me \"You want to take a cookie\".\n\nAll my friends over there were jealous beyond measure and I still cherish the memory.\n\nToday we didn't lose the Princess of Alderaan, we lost the Princess of our hearts.",

I know your wallets are all probably still hurting from Christmas, but having had grandparents who have suffered and died from heart problems, if you could donate even just a single dollar to your local or national heart and stroke foundation/charity, it will make my day a whole lot better for me than being gilded.\n\nCanada:\n\nhttp://www.heartandstroke.ca/\n\nUnited States:\n\nhttp://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/\n\nAustralia:\n\nhttps://heartfoundation.org.au/\n\nSweden:\n\nhttps://www.hjart-lungfonden.se/\nPlease, find a charity of your choice and donate to it. Let's honor Carrie's legacy by doing some good in her name.\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\n/u/youngs0945 made an excellent suggestion for donations:\n\n&gt;She was also a longtime mental health advocate and the [National Alliance on Mental Illness](http://www.nami.org/) is one of the organizations listed on her webpage if people are looking to donate in her honor.\n\nThanks again for all the donations thus far. If you haven't done so already, **please** make a donation on Carrie's behalf.",

Even in recent interviews, she's so quirky and full of life, and not holding herself back at all.\n\nShe portrayed one of the most iconic strong female characters in history, and taught a generation of girls that princesses didn't have to be dainty damsels in distress.\n\nThere are a million thoughts and memories running through my head, but my pain and memories are nothing compared to her family and friends.\n\nWe'll all miss you, Princess Carrie.",

Carrie was one-of-a-kind who belonged to us all- whether she liked it or not. She was OUR Princess, damn it, &amp; the actress who played her blurred into one gorgeous, fiercely independent &amp; ferociously funny, take-charge woman who took our collective breath away. Determined &amp; tough, but with a vulnerability that made you root for her &amp; want her to succeed &amp; be happy. She played such a crucial role in my professional &amp; personal life, &amp; both would have been far emptier without her. I am grateful for the laughter, the wisdom, the kindness &amp; even the bratty, self-indulgent crap my beloved space-twin gave me through the years. Thanks Carrie. I love you.\" - Mark Hamill ",

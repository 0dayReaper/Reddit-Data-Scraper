We see Ezra walking through and there are doorways that lead to crucial moments from the movies. Upon hearing Ahsoka he rushes over and pulls her through a doorway oblivious to what this place actually is. \n\nTheoretically Ezra *could* have jumped to any moment those doorways led to, however \u201cTime Travel\u201d in the more popular science fiction sense doesn\u2019t exist as it would interfere with the events of the movies and canon. \n\nWhat happens in that particular episode of Rebels isn\u2019t that Ezra was *changing* anything, it\u2019s that the story finally wrapped around to the other side of the particular moment Ahsoka was dueling Vader.",

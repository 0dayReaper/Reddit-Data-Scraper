Like a magic show, it\u2019s there to get you to focus on something when the illusion is not in what the outcome is, but how it comes about.\n\nIf Han can\u2019t win, he\u2019ll cheat and run away.\n\nIf Din can\u2019t win, he\u2019ll fight his way out.\n\nIf either win, the other won\u2019t die. They\u2019re both \u201cgood guys.\u201d\n\nIf this were based on reality it wouldn\u2019t be Star Wars.",

Worst case he hits and Din is momentarily blinded but then is still able to Maneuver to take a shot. Or he misses and hits the helmet, throwing Din off balance and maybe getting to squeeze off a second round. Best case is the blaster bolt goes right through and rails Din in between the eyes.\n\nSo best case you\u2019re right, Han wins, Kill shot, but if he\u2019s wrong and the visor is resistant then Either Din is blinded, so maybe Han gets another shot at another exposed body part, or Din is knocked down. If Din is knocked down then again maybe Han could put a round where the flesh is but the problem with that is that again Din\u2019s armor. Din is safe when his body is moving unpredictable since it\u2019s hard for blaster bolts to actually hit in between the armor, during that time he\u2019ll be able to reposition them shoot han down.",

But in direct combat with all of Din\u2019s gadgets, it becomes very soon one sided.",

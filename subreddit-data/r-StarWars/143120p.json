    "postText": "I finally got around to finishing Andor. I'm going to start with what the show did well. They painted a really good picture of what oppression looks like. They made the side of the oppressors look really relatable to people in privileged positions (and in some ways, I even felt called out, which was a bit of a wake up call, I'll admit). At the same time, it made it easy to empathize with the people who were being oppressed. Their struggles were plain as day and the horrors inflicted on them were unforgivable. The show did really well with this portrayal, and I think this was their main goal, so I will say that they accomplished what they set out to do. It was indeed a success.\n\nHOWEVER... They could have created the same effect in half the time. There was no need for it to be 12 episodes long. So much of this extra time was spent developing characters who, in the end, did nothing to serve the plot. The pacing was really slow, and, while there were some excellent scenes in there, there's so much blank space in between that was just painful to sit through. (Hence why it took me so long to finish the show.)\n\nIt was good. I just don't understand why I keep hearing that it's the \"best thing Star Wars has ever produced\". Andor was beautifully written, but horribly edited. As a writer myself, I know that I can't use everything I write down. There are scenes I've written that I love that will never make it into my books because they don't serve the overall message I'm giving. They're a distraction, so I cut them out. The producers of Andor utterly failed to grasp this concept. If they had cut out the fluff and sped up the pacing, the show would have been amazing.\n\nI'm not saying there was never a point where they should slow down and let the messaging sink in. There were definitely important moments for that. However, putting our focus on the development of a character who isn't going to stick around isn't helpful to that end.\n\nTL;DR Andor had beautiful moments, but way too much fluff. If it had been limited to 6 episodes, they would have narrowed it down to what's important and made the show way better.\n\nEdit: Y'all are toxic AF. Is it so hard to handle someone disagreeing with you? Why can't we have civil discussion?",

Cassian was already one of these people. Rogue One established that excellently. Rogue One was an excellent demonstration of how the success of the war was built on people whose sacrifice isn't even remembered. It's a great message. And then they tried to build on that message by contradicting it--they made Cassian a super notable person who EVERYONE is trying to track down, and developed all these unimportant people behind the unimportant person who is suddenly important.",

That is baffling to me\u2026\n\nNurchi, the guy who Cassian owed money to, tried to parlay his knowledge of Ferrix and of Cassian into a free ride off of Ferrix, courtesy of the Empire. He betrayed his culture and home world to make a quick buck, and it got him killed. He sold out to the side he thought would win, given their power and resources. \n\nCinta and Vel are a fascinating dynamic. Vel is the \u201crich girl\u201d who acts tough and is trying to fight against politics she doesn\u2019t agree with. She comes across as a hardened, committed resistance fighter\u2014until we meet Cinta. Cinta is who Vel thinks she is, but has got a lot of work to do before she gets there. This is highlighted when Vel tries to pass some of Cinta\u2019s wisdom off on her cousin, Mon Mothma, as her own. It feels a bit flat because we now know Vel is struggling with how fully committed she is. She\u2019s not at Cinta\u2019s level in that regard. Their romantic relationship is the perfect (and simplest) way to showcase this: Cinta is pure \u201ccause;\u201d that\u2019s all that matters. Vel seems to resent this, and pushes for the relationship to be a higher priority. All of this can be illustrated very quickly and simply within the context of a romantic relationship without anything expository. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m mystified that someone who claims to \u201cwrite\u201d for a living can\u2019t see these fairly simple storytelling tools at work. I\u2019m left wondering if the rest of your complaints are just these basic narrative elements going over your head.",

It shows that humans have connections but it also shows that nothing comes before the rebellion, rebels sacrifice their lives (both real and emotional) for the rebellion. Cinta lost her entire family to stormtroopers so obviously her back story is important. It's what drives her, as does her love for Vel as she says \"I'm a mirror, Vel, you love me because I show you what you need to see.\"\n\nWhy did they build up the guy Cassian owed money to just to kill him off? Which guy, bruv? Deema? Brasso? Nurchi? Xanwan? Cassian owed money to a lot of people. \n\nSyril was in 10 of the 12 episodes...I'd hardly call that building him up and \"wasn't going to come back into the story except to save his crush\"...plus you know there is another season coming too, right? A season that will surely show Syril and Dedra teaming up to take on the rebels. \n\nIt's weird to criticize Andor for fleshing out characters and showing backgrounds when so much of the story is driven by characters backgrounds and emotional connections. I've never heard people criticize Star Wars for having too much depth in their characters.",

Vel barely is, either. Yes, there is a message that the show is getting across with them. However, they could have easily connected it to the plot if that was important to them by having actual interaction between them and Cassian. Again, maybe season 2 will fix that.

I don't like the trend in shows, though, where they leave it so loose that it doesn't make sense without a sequel season. Isn't that part of what Rings of Power is getting so much flack for? Why is Andor special? But, enough people clearly loved it that they'll have no problem giving us a second season, so if they make it more connected at that point, that'll work out fine.",

But I see where you're coming from.\n\nThe pacing is my biggest gripe.  People say the show needed that time to get build up so that the big moments would hit hard.  But I don't quite buy that.  Not in this case.\n\nYou obviously need to build up to the big climax by raising the tension and setting up the character motivation.  But for me Andor spent so much time doing that, that it lost tension.  I started thinking \"stop stalling and get on with it\" instead of \"I wonder what's going to happen next!\"  Especially in the first half of the season.  And that's not where you want to be in a thriller show like this.\n\nI've seen plenty of movies and shows (including other Star Wars ones) do more with less time.  In the specific case of Andor I think you could EASILY cut the story down to 10 episodes, and have the end product be better for it.\n\nAnd I think they could've done that in the editing room.  No need for reshoots or rewrites to improve the pacing.\n\nTo be clear, this is a relatively minor criticism.  I enjoyed the series, it has so many all-time great moments and I really appreciate them playing around with genre.  I want Star Wars to do more of that.  I'm excited to see what they do with the 2nd season.\n\nBut, like ALL Star Wars media, I don't think it's perfect.",

It's not like I hated the show, I just don't necessarily think it deserves as much praise as it's gotten.\n\nI'm not really looking forward to the second season that much, but, it does provide an opportunity for them to interconnect the loose ends more and prove me wrong, so I'll give it a chance.",

What a lot of people *are* saying is that Andor is the best Disney-era Star Wars content. Big difference.\n\nWhat did you think of Rogue One?",

XD\n\n&gt;What did you think of Rogue One?\n\nI LOVED Rogue One. It's my favorite Star Wars movie. Before you try to compare it to Andor, Rogue One has literally none of the issues I complained about in this post. The pacing kept you on the edge of your seat, and the characters got just enough development to get attached to them, but left them at a point where you felt the weight of their stories being cut short. Ironically, the only character I didn't feel was used well in Rogue One was Cassian, so maybe that's why we ended up here.",

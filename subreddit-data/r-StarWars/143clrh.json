From Bad Batch we know, hundrets of clone survived, but they may been in the last months of fight. \n     I didn't find answer to this question anywhere, so I am asking here. \n(PS: sorry for my english gramatics)",

They fired at us with everything they had. We crashed. Most of us were either dead or severely injured. So when they started working their way through the wounded, killing us off, I knew there was no hope. I ran. It still haunts me.",

And over exposed frame or a yellow light base lens flare does a much better effect and you only need one/two frame verse the arc of the welder spark \"spatter\"\n\nThe choreography is solid, but very fast pace. Consider using pauses, saber lock ups, and space between opponents to creat a back and forth to the combat. It's like writing a sentence. Commas, periods, semicolons etc help creat a dynamic rhythm versus a run on sentence if you'll forgive the metaphor.\n\nOtherwise this is fantastic! I love the movements, and skill!",

So replace the clacking sounds of course, though I wish there was a way to also keep the footsteps bc they really show how real it is. And as for the sparks, only a baby dim few, and I honestly think the glow as is fits really well bc it still leaves streaks but doesn\u2019t drown out the actual movement.",

Though couple of notes:\nReduce the spark density and speed, and make them a little fainter to match the motion blur and focus. Don't be afraid to add in clash bursts. Vary them in size dependant on clash length and strength.\n\nI've not got audio on but a couple of people mentioned using varied clash sounds. Figure out how you hear each clash in your head and find the matching sound effect. Use the clash strength as a basis.\n\nHope this helps and I look forward to more videos.",

As someone who also does editing as a hobby, I\u2019d suggest trying to find different sounds for the lightsabers to diversify it in post, also I recommend trying to get the effect to match the quality of the video. The sparks seemed a little too abundant and we\u2019re in higher definition than the video itself. But other than that, great work. The choreography was awesome! Though I\u2019d recommend adding some flavor to it by having them use the force. Maybe have one catch the blade with the force as I comes down on their side before using the force to push it back. \n\nOh, and don\u2019t be afraid to change angles of the camera once in a while, I\u2019d definitely recommend a few close up over the shoulder shots if you want to capture their expressions in a light saber lock, maybe even with a little camera shake.",

His involvement might actually make the \"reset\" at the beginning of TFA, as well as the rise and secrecy of Snoke, make sense.   \n\n\nFor those who didn't watch the Celebration panel, Palpatine's actor (Ian McDiarmid) popped on stage after the trailer ran for the first time. 100% Palp will have a presence in this movie.

If it's a dark place, shouldn't Palp be able to manipulate what Rey sees if he's already a voice in her head? I could see him as kind of a Ruin character, for anybody who has read the first Mistborn trilogy.\n\nI'm 100% convinced Palp is going to have been the one pulling the strings. He learned his master's secret of immortality and perfected it. It turns out it was being a dark side Force ghost, but hey, if it works?",

This is not unlike Voldemort or Sauron. \n\nHe waited in Luke\u2019s head for years, waiting for the right moment.\n\nAlong comes Ben who has some darkness, but Palpatine doesn\u2019t jump yet.\n\nHe waits until the boy has had some training, and then starts corrupting Luke\u2019s thoughts that Ben is evil. But it\u2019s all a manipulation to get Luke to pull the lightsaber, which he does. \n\nOnce this happens, and Ben\nIs filled with pain and betrayal, Palpatine latches on to those negative emotions, leaving Luke, who realizes the error of his ways. It\u2019s too late, and Kylo Ren is born.\n\nThis makes Luke innocent, but manipulated, so still imperfect, and Kylo the ultimate victim who, although rid of Snoke, who was not in fact corrupting him, still controlled by a higher power that he had to be free of.",

I'll pass.  \n\nThere's got to be some bunch of heretics who say \"screw this\" and just try to live ordinary lives or focus more on figuring out how this whole life energy thing works from a scientific perspective. If there really is this life energy connecting everything and it's documentable and provable, then it could completely revolutionize religion, politics, and EVERY field of science from biology and medicine to physics.",

It was the film's way of addressing the \"Han Shot First\" controversy (by showing that he's definitely the kind of guy to kill someone before they're even ready for a fight), but it also fit within the theme of the film, since it's all about trust. Not only do we get confirmation that Han is in fact the kind of guy who shoots first, but we find out what made him that way.",

I thought it had a great pace, and was shot super well. It\u2019s just too bad they flooded the market with Star Wars because I think people should have given it a bigger chance.",

This would\u2019ve been in the months leading up to Revenge of the Sith, so at the time I just thought George Lucas managed to plan 20+ years ahead and found an actor that looked exactly how Hayden Christensen would\u2019ve looked. \n\nI was not smart then and not much has changed.",

All of the tension we saw of Vader *blatantly* having a powerful internal conflict of having to sit and watch his son be tortured was deflated like a fart balloon with that edit.\n\nLucas is pretty much the worst example of \"tell everything\" because evidently he didn't think that the audience was smart enough to deduce things on their own.

And then he has the audacity to bitch and moan when the fans don't like his \"my way or the highway\" approach, so he retaliates like a fucking child and just throws it away to Disney.\n\nYeah, he's not my ideal person at all.

How could Greedo miss? He's, like, three feet away. This is stupid!'\n\nEven if I put my admitted bias aside, it's a bad change from a narrative point of view, since it totally undercuts Hans rogue-to-moral-hero arc:\n\n- In the original scene, he kills Greedo stone dead in cold blood, purely to save himself, which serves as a counterpoint to the Battle of Yavin, when he leaves with his money and then comes back to risk his life for the sake of others and save the rebellion.\n- In the special edition version, his self-serving callousness is totally nerfed because now he's defending himself against a gunshot, which significantly elevates his moral position.\n\n(As you can tell, I'm not a fan of the edits. ;) )",

He was a character in it for the money and didn't believe in the cause. Him shooting first was exactly the kind of ruthlessness you would expect from such a character.  \n\nLuke in a similar scenario would likely try to talk Greedo into letting him go for a lot longer and wouldn't resort to killing him until it was unavoidable.  Han made a token effort and then blasted him without remorse.  It added to the believably that he wasn't coming back when he left before the battle of Yavin thus making it all the more satisfying when he comes back to save Luke during the trench run.",

But IMO the point of the scene is that Han had the guts to kill in cold blood while Greedo didn't.",

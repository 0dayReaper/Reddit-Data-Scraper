Palpatine does not think anyone but himself is worthy of having any authority in achieving his goal, unless it's ultimately convenient. Tarkin acting on his behalf would require Palpatine to reveal Order 66 to someone who isn't 100% obedient by default (and there's no benefit from anyone else knowing such an Order existed since the clones were conceived)\n\nMost important, Palpatine has been waiting how long for that moment? I bet he was looking forward to it.",

Certainly better than what he actually got.\n\nIt would establish in the films Tarkin's position and relationship with the Emperor, helping explain why he's Vader's boss in ANH.\n\nIt makes considerably more sense for Palpatine to issue the order to someone higher up the chain of command, rather than him seemingly phoning up random clone troopers like he's on a first name basis with the troops.\n\nIt plants the seed that Palpatine had collaborators within the Republic Military, showing that his corrupting influence had already compromised the fleet. \n\nIt's an unintrusive way to create another link between the PT and the OT.\n\nIt's a simple cameo that achieves a lot more for the franchise than having Palpatine talk to Commander Cody.",

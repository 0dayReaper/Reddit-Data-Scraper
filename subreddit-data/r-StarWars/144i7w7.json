    "postText": "The real world answer would be because a tank with giant legs is intimidating and looks awesome. But if the republic and imperial armies needed troop transports, why did they give the walkers (AT-TE, AT-RT, AT-AT, AT-ST) legs and not thrusters/engines?\n\nWas thinking about this because an AT-AT for example can be easily crippled with one tow cable. The separatist troop transports didn't seem to have this issue as they, as well as the tanks, just barely hovered over the ground.",

            "comment": "Walkers exist because of the weight-to-repulsorlift ratio. Putting a repulsorlift in a heavy armored vehicle is not energy efficient.\n\nThis is why fighting vehicles with repulsorlifts tend to rely on energy shields rather that physical armor. In the case of a big, heavy armored transport, you would end up using more energy to keep it aloft.\n\nGive the vehicle legs, wheels, or treads and no energy shields allows the vehicle more tactical range and more power devoted to speed and weapons. Keep in mind, vehicles that rely on energy shields for defense can not cross through other energy shields, but most shields can be breached by slow moving infantry and armored vehicles that don't rely on shields or repulsorlift tech.\n\nAnd if you really need your fighting vehicle to fly... then you may as well just build a ship.",

Having a hovering heavy assault vehicle invites a clear method of attack (get stuff below the vehicle) from the getgo. AT-TEs were designed to be the precursor to AT-ATs.\n\nIn universe:\n\nAT-TEs were way better at traversing varied terrain (e.g. climbing vertical cliffs) compared to MTTs, and using walkers stuck around when the Republic became the Empire.",

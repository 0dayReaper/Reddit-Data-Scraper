He's a useful idiot, that is manipulated to help the empire take hold. And every complains he's an annoying idiot \"just made for kids\".  That's the genius. He's both for kids and to document the historical pattern of useful idiots enabling fascism.",

AND when he was successful at something, it was because of his ridiculous luck (which I think is an odd funneling of the force) and his natural talents. But also people reacted to him reasonably.  \"...No. The other senator from Naboo.\" is probably one of my favorite lines, and the episode where Jar Jar canonically fucks and also Mace Windu is constantly frustrated with him is one of my favorite non-heavy arcs. (pong krell, ahsoka being framed and Fives season 6 storylines are my favorites otherwise)",

Even as they are now, imagine the force that a black bear/chimp could put behind a rock or sharpened hand axe.\n\nI know people like to laugh at the Ewoks but if you put something with the strength of a black bear or chimp and gave it the intelligence and bone structure of a human, it would be capable of terrible physical damage.\n\nAgain, those tree trunk traps would take days if not weeks to construct, so that\u2019s bullshit. But them throwing rocks or using physical strikes to kill fully armored stormtroopers, that\u2019s incredibly realistic given the physiology of already existing Earth creatures.\n\nSo now imagine what a Wookiee could do. Han\u2019s joke about Wookiees ripping arms out of sockets is not only realistic but would be easier than us yanking the starter cord of a lawn mower. An average Wookiee must have roughly the strength of a silver back gorilla, if not more, and also have far more useful hands and obviously human level intelligence.",

It broke down how in modern war, it takes something like 200,000 bullets per kill and even at their worst, it takes stormtroopers like 200 shots per kill in the OT.\n\nSo aside from main character having plot armor, the stormtroopers actually do have the accuracy that Obi Wan talks about in ANH.",

Volunteers at homeless shelters, has given millions to charity, and has been seen giving homeless people cash and clothing with no fanfare.\n\nThe fact that a universe can contain such opposites is a strength, and makes it more true to our existence.

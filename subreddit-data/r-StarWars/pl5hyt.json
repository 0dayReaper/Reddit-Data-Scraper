He might as well be female in some of those versions.",

I mean *maybe* we could see faithful and canon I think it's more likely that they choose one or the other, especially since they've so recently started the High Republic (which is good stuff as well btw). Another thing to consider is the conclusion of the original KOTOR largely depended on the player's decisions - it would feel a little weird to have \"this\" route canon and \"the rest\" not, but I guess they did that for the original so who knows? TL,DR: Maybe?",

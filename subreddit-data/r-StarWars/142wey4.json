Legend is the Spartans killed anyone at birth who did not meet their standard of physical fitness.\n\n While we have not seen this directly yet on the Mandalorian  - it appears the Mandalorians (the children of the watch sect) are very accepting of individuals into their group and do not impose limiting factors on members other than the rules of their sect.  And those rules are the same for all members.  \n\nHowever being a Mandalorian is a hard and dangerous life.  The mandalorians let fate decide who does and doesn\u2019t make it.  They let fate decide what are an individual\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.",

They aren\u2019t espousing uniformity, which was a big part of Spartan culture, since they were raising an army from birth, not individual warriors. \n\nFor mandalorians, each is an individual one man army, supposed to be able to hold their own. That means at its core, it doesn\u2019t matter if your missing an arm or leg, crippled, whether your a different species, and or new or born into the mandalorian culture\u2026 if you can fight and survive, you are still mandalorian. \n\nMake do with what you\u2019ve got, cause if your stuck on a planet stripped of your weapons besides a single knife and surrounded by enemies, a good mandalorian should try to survive no matter what as a matter of fact.",

I figured this was a long time before \"The Bad Batch\" were ever thought up, but they happen to be Clone Force 99 with numbers CT-99xx. Wouldn't it be possible that 99 was part of that batch but his mutations hindered his battle prowess?",

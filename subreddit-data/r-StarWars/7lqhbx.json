Kylo Ren in particular just has a brutality and intensity to him when he is fighting that adds so much to his fights. \n\nThere is this aggression that makes everything wild and unpredictable, swinging with power and intensity. It's unmeasured and heavy, but the style behind it is very clean. It's like Ren wants to fight like a good sword fighter should, but he is just going too hard.\n\nThat scene in TLJ... best fight in the series IMO.",

Settling the weight forward, crouching a little bit to condense the body for a quick movement, tensing up the way he does - that's someone who has done a bit of fighting in real life. \n\nIt also gives him a wild energy, like an animal getting ready for something. It's very \"non-cinematic\", in that it's realistic but not very \"good\" or \"clean\" on camera. Gives it a sense of something that we as a human audience react to, even if we don't quite notice. ",

I remember at the time people were arguing that Dooku was telling Obi-wan the truth and I was like \"You fools!  He's lying to get what he wants from Kenobi!  This is why Lee was cast as Saruman in LotR, because Saruman could use his voice to persuade others using magic.  Dooku is doing the same thing here!\"\n\n\"Join me, and together we can defeat the Sith!\" is clearly a lie--Dooku will overthrow Sidious and Kenobi will become his new apprentice.\n\nIt can't possibly be true.

Biggs, Obiwan, Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen, The Organas and Alderaan. With an HBO style GoT format they are VERY similar. It's actually the exact argument I use to claim that GoT is just a heroes journey with camouflage.  Any story that follows the random people who die becomes a snuff film by comparison to a traditional heroes journey. ",

But you can see them touch in the first Obi-wan vs. Darth Vader scene in the Blu-ray edition because you can see powder burst and fall from the blades when they do.  (The 'blades' were dowels that were powered by a motor so they spun, but I believe they were covered in reflective tape, not paint.  Same technology as highway signs, btw, that reflects the light back at its source.)\n\nThis was so problematic during filming that rotoscoping was used to enhance the effect and they didn't need the hassle of the props in the later films.  For the prequels, they used carbon-fiber rods (since the aluminum ones kept bending) and painted them neon colors but had to heat shrink wrap the prop rods with plastic to keep the paint from flaking off (and being caught by the camera) during filming.\n\nThey used illuminated blades for Episode II's duel between Anakin and Dooku although light sabers had previously not cast light except in Episode IV and had cast shadows on the floor.  I don't remember when they started painting out the blade's shadows during the prequels.  For the sequel trilogy, they're using lit blades now.",

The saber fight is obviously much more humble than what we'd get in following movies, but viewing it for what it is, I still think it's pretty effective.\n\nThis re-imagining looks fantastic and wouldn't be out of place in a special edition.  The main difference I think is that this fight shows a lot more passion than the fight in ANH, which was more defensive on both ends.",

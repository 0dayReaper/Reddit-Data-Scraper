(Which are more tolerant of children characters for *the worst possible reasons*.)\n\nThere was a whole USENET group dedicated to hating on Wesley Crusher back in the day. And that was even before TPM and the reveal that Darth Vader was once a dumb kid just like everyone else.",

Like when we see a young Conan at the beginning of Conan the Barbarian in 1982.  \n\nHe doesn't act like an adult, though, nor is he a super kid,...plus he's only there for a short time.",

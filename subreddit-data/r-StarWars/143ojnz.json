Still, most of the Jedi probably weren't fooled by Padme and Anakin and were running a, *'don't ask, don't tell'* policy on individual Jedi's lives.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey never seemed to probe too deeply into Obi-Wan and Satine or even Dooku after he left the order.  Sifo Dyas was able to conduct private financial transactions without any oversight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this leads to me to believe there's something of a social contract going on with the Jedi, don't push your luck and at least maintain some fa\u00e7ade of upholding the order, and the council won't poke their noses into your life too much.  If Anakin broke that, he'd have to kicked out for the sake of the order, despite that being wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPadme might get off a little easier, her career might not be over, but her credibility would take a hard hit, if she had a higher position in the Republic she might have been able to overcome it.",

Maybe they could cut him off from the force, if that's even still something that's a: in the new canon or b: something the modern Jedi even know how to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDooku and Ahsoka weren't exactly lacking in talent or force ability and they were able to leave / be kicked out of the council.  Probably Anakin would get the same treatment Ahsoka did, just as an internal matter (with their own internal tribunal).  I guess their plan is, if he goes off the rails they'll send a squad of Jedi after him, Anakin as far as they knew right up to the end, wasn't that powerful and got his ass handed too him repeatedly by Dooku.  His reputation in the fandom isn't quite up to his skills.",

In the EU we see similar situations happen to Jedi in the order who are married get a relatively minor punishment and left alone so long as they don\u2019t let their love become attachment.\n\nAnd Obi-wan obviously knew and didn\u2019t do anything about it, and in a deleted scene Windu was told about Anakin\u2019s feelings for Padme and basically went \u201cand?

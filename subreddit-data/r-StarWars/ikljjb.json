Of course you would need a solar heater and tank on top. Maybe the customer didn\u2019t want that because they had an outhouse and shower everywhere they go.",

TV is up next to the bed door.\n3. Toilet slides out from a cabinet, no shower (Most vans don't!)\n4. I do not do commission builds at this time, but I am working on a modern ambulance conversion at the moment.\n5. I think this would cost between $10k-$15k to build, not including the U-Haul or the labor.\n6. There would be an access door to the cab through the falcon tunnel!\n7. As for the exterior, I was thinking of painting it in the style of R2-D2\n8. The drawing doesn't show that the Death Star style window would have a motorized slide up shade with the Death Star targeting screen on it, there will be a long window on the back behind the booth, and the kitchen would have upper cabinets.\n9. I designed the basic layout in SketchUp, that way all the proportions are right, then draw the finished idea in Procreate on my iPad Pro\n\nEdit: added things",

I'll probably get hate for this, but honestly I think it's one of the worse Star Wars games from that era. I gave it a pass for the bad camera and controls and general clunkiness, but the gameplay itself is pretty bland once the novelty of playing as Jango wears off. Most of the game is spent holding the lock on button and spamming the shoot button as fast as possible while you strafe around enemies. It's not awful but it's pretty hard to stay engaged, even though the story is really cool and the cutscenes are surprisingly well made for the time period.\n\nAnyway, hate me if you will, but I think nostalgia has a big factor in how people remember Bounty Hunter. Playing it as an adult with no real connection to the game was a pretty rough time.",

But on the bright side... What are we expecting from a story about a lone drifter bounty hunter anyway? The show's narrative is constructed exactly like you'd expect a video game to be, and that kind of embodies this type of Star Wars story for me. Cool stuff happens on the side quests, and the characters are neat. I see Mando trek out on another planet he's supposed to be just passin' through and am upset he's not getting closer to his goal, but then some cool standoff happens and I'm like okay, this is satisfying.\n\nAnd they also need to be careful with how quickly they advance the plot, because if they go too fast they'll miss out on good content.",

Compared to the decade prior, Star Wars' video game offerings have been an absolute fucking disappointment.\n\nVideo games are what separates Star Wars from every other major science fiction IP. Not even Marvel can put out good video games, yet Star Wars has decades worth of classic titles. Star Wars video games are a HUGE media market that Disney is just sitting on its hands with, and I really don't know why they're half-assing so hard. The EA exclusivity deal is just detrimental to Star Wars video games in general because you're bottlenecking production to a single publisher. I mean, I get why Disney did this, their primary interest is pumping out live-service, heavily-monetized products in order to turn a profit, but that goes to show how ass-backwards Disney's priorities are.\n\nDisney also seems afraid to release multiple concurrent pieces of media, like they think a new video game will cannibalize the viewership of The Mandalorian or something. That's a severe underestimation of the Star Wars fanbase if I've ever seen one, and not one that is backed up by past evidence either. LucasArts &amp; other publishers were pumping out video games at the same time The Clone Wars show was first airing, and neither side suffered for it. In fact, the sheer abundance of Star Wars media in the 2000s elevated the IP beyond the scope of the Prequels. We're currently in a time where Star Wars needs more new, *fresh* content than ever, yet Disney is missing out on a massive opportunity by sitting idly with its video game production. Why the HELL would you deliberately choose to restrict the growth of a franchise? It seems like these days, the only time a new video game ever comes out is when there *isn't* a show airing. It makes no sense to me.\n\nShit, video games are the best medium for telling smaller side stories that wouldn't fit in a broader show or movie, but are great for expanding the universe nonetheless. Bring back 1313. Star Wars' universe is virtually limitless.  There's endless stories you could explore with video games. We don't need to stay confined to this crowded, smelly bubble between Ep. 3 and 4. \n\nThe most cynical interpretation I can think of is that Disney is deliberately alienating its video game base for the sake of making Star Wars a more consumer-friendly, casual audience commodity. I *hope* that this isn't actually what's going on, and I don't necessarily think that's what is happening here. Nonetheless, if you look at the 2000s-2010s era of Star Wars video games compared to what we got in the current decade, the disparity is inexcusable.",

We got the Thrawn Trilogy which blew our minds, now we're playing as Luke Skywalker's apprentice!\n\nBattlefront 1 and 2 (the good ones) Star Wars shooters which were amazing for their time. The new ones had no soul. \n\nRepublic Commando. What can I even say? Stood up to Halo in terms of the single player experience and goddman it we deserved a sequel. \n\nThere's 7. 7 absolutely fantastic games I grew up with on the original xbox, and I don't think any of them were Xbox exclusive. \n\nI also had Rogue Squadrons 2 and 3 and Bounty Hunter for the Gamecube. Empire at War on PC, what am I missing from the early 2000s?\n\nAlso LEGO Star Wars! \n\nI also really enjoyed Force Unleashed 1 and 2 but don't consoder them a part of this era.",

I grew up with so much more Star Wars than that, and I know countless others did too. \n\nThe thing is, the movies were accessible to more people than the rest. My dad loved Star Wars too, and still is a gamer. We couldn't afford the books, the comics, all the games. My dad was the guy who knew a guy who could get your Ps2 or Xbox kitted out to make the games a little more accessible. So I was lucky enough to grow up with the games as well. I did my best going to libraries and getting books but relatively few were actually available. \n\nSo I had all the games on xbox and ps2, I got some of the other games on gamecube when they were out a while and could get them pre-owned for cheap. So I actually missed out on a lot. \n\nNow, I own every book in the new canon in hardcover since I just happened to start making money when Tarkin came out.",

Some are stronger than the others, but it's free to play through the main story and it's vastly different for each class.",

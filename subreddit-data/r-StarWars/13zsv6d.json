In movie 1, she was already in the rebellion, captured while acquiring technical blueprints to the death star.  Interrogated by Darth Fucking Vader who not only got nothing out of her, but didn't even manage to detect that she was his daughter.  \n\nWhen Luke and Han come to rescue her, she's not weeping in a cell, she's casually laying down and instantly starts making fun of her jailers when they enter the room.  This is AFTER they destroyed her home planet, and she didn't talk.  \n\nThen after Luke looses Obi, a man he met earlier that same day... she's giving him comfort for all he's lost, rather than submitting to the aching chasm of her own loss and recent physical torture.",

Not only did that not work for her, but you could tell that the lifestyle she was leading (partying and drugs) was really catching up to her already in the third film. She looked tired, and a little older than she was. Her voice was already taking on that husky sound that she didn\u2019t really have for the first two films, but she\u2019s had it ever since. This was her best look and best hairstyle, it framed her face perfectly. It really is a shame what happened to her, or that her mental illness wasn\u2019t treated properly. She was absolutely beautiful, very intelligent, and from all accounts, a wonderful person to be around. She self medicated and then self destructed.",

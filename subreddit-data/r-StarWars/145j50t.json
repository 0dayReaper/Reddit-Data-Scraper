However, they didn't turn out well: the shape was very complex and I also couldn't find a way to correctly attach them to the lower part of the leg while respecting perspective.\nAfter this big struggle I decided to change the feet even though there would be inaccuracies... so that's the reason for the change lol\nOn instagram I posted a while ago the process, you can see how many times I redid the [legs](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr05icoN698/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)\n\nThanks for noticing and for the compliment!!",

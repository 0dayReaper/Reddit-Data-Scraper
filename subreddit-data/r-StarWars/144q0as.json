He could kill him there, but he wants to defeat Obi-Wan at his best, which is why he is fine with him escaping. He's enjoying the hunt and thinks the next time they meet, Obi-Wan will give him a proper fight and he'll win; hence driving the line in his head that he was always better.",

He could have gone anywhere else and carried the fight on just fine. Apparently having his jumping skills questioned was just too much.",

In movie language, this is clearly meant to imply that there's some sort of inner turmoil going on inside Vader.\n\nIt's a great moment, and as is the case with so many Vader moments, a lot of the details as to what is going on inside the helmet is left up to viewer interpretation.\n\nIt's good to remember that people don't always act optimally.  Especially when they're dealing with difficult stuff.",

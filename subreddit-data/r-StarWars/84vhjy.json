But chasing whales seems like a better gimmick for indie developers with mobile apps than a behemoth like EA.",

They could now throw out games every 3 years or so, and literally never have a drop in sales, because DK fans **will buy them.** That's free money. The profits won't be nuts, but it's free money. \n\nInstead they cash in instantly with the mobile wallet vampire, get haunted by awful press for a year, crash the entire IP that they just bought and barely make more than they would have anyway.\n\nEA is the worst company in the AAA gaming sphere in terms of being pro-consumer, but also in terms of investment, like you said. Everything they do turns. to. shit. Give it 10 years, fuck, 5 years, and I think they'll be looking pretty weak if they haven't found a lucky break or a huge change of heart.",

It is just them saving face saying 'we didn't know this was going on. Bad EA'.",

The better any of that is the more likely they are to create more fans and push people into consuming more from the ecosystem.\n\nIf a bunch of it is junk or gimmicky then consumers start to associate Star Wars with junk.\n\nThis is why some brands are very slow and putting out new products because they are after the long term profit and not the short term. \n\nDisney seems to try to balance long term and short term profits.

Let's get some number crunching going. They released sales for the first month to be 1 million off of their projection. The thing is that they revised their projection from 10 to 8 million shortly before the game launched in response to the negative reception of the loot boxes. They just did not correct enough.\n\nSo after 3 months, Battlefront 2 sold 7 million while Battlefront 2015 sold 9 million in the same timeframe. Battlefront 2015 sold about 14 million in about 18 months (a little longer, but who cares). The revised projection for Battlefront 2 shortly before launch was 13 million. Them failing by 1 million in the first 3 months means this probalby is more like 11 to 11.5 million.\n\nKeep in mind that 8 months before launch, the EA estimate was that Battlefront 2 will outsell Battlefront 2015 by ~10%. This works out to the ~10 million estimate after 3 months and to a 15.5 - 16 million estimate over 18 months. **The 3 month estimate was already 30% below the original expectation.** If we extrapolate that to 18 months we get to **a total loss of sold units of 4.5 - 5 million.**\n\nSay the average sale is 40$ (with discounts and what not, that is **lost revenue at about 220 million** compared to the target. That certainly sends a message and is about 3 times Battlefront 2's production budget.\n\nThis is completely discounting micro transactions. Because the microtransactions never were active (they got suspended a few days before the launch), I guess that's fair.\n\n/edit: I did not consider a lower than normal tail end of the sales curve. That might still happen with decreased developer support (because you can't justify spending the funds). That might bump the figures a bit.",

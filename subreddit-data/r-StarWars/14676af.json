Jason Wingreen, who Morrison replaced the voicework of, is only credited as Boba Fett on IMDB in Star Wars roles.   \n\n\nSo I imagine it's just a weird editing mistake, and it should have read \"... re-recorded the lines of the character Boba Fett (Jango's son, and another clone) in the 2004 DVD...\"\n\nStill kinda clunky, but that's my guess too.",

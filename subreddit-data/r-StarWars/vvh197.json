What did they think was going to happen when they fought him. He\u2019s a very experience force user and they can barely touch the force. Why were they not following the order of their master anyway? It\u2019s not like they just follow anyone or they would have just been following Snoke. I also laugh that Snoke says \u201cMaster of the knights of ren!\u201d Like is some great accomplishment when we know they are kinda just a joke when compared to like any force users.",

In the *first act* a distress call would've gone out triggered by  Finn and Rose who were sent to infiltrate the old Jedi Temple with a message from Leia. Its explained that the temple is on an older communications network not jammed by the First Order and could be used to broadcast an open message. The message wouldnt be received by everyone, but those who get it could spread it\n\nThe message wouldve called not just common people, but remaining New Republic forces, independent systems, and even old Imperials who hadnt stood with the FO to rally. In the opening of the film The Resistance stole The Eclipse SSD and wanted to use it to rally a fleet to assault the FO capital on Coruscant\n\nThere still wouldve been a \"fleet arrives to save the day\" ending, but instead of just random ships out of nowhere it couldve been a mix of actual militaries and commoners arriving and paying off something built up since the opening crawl, not an out of nowhere \"And suddenly everyone is here now!\"",

Stuff is happening in the background that has no relation to the plot, making it seem full. In Solo, there's other people in the station at Correllia doing their own thing with no relation to Han. In Rogue One, there's whole scenes with the characters interacting with an environment that's not just about them. You get the feeling that the market where we see Cassian first or the town on Jedha have a history and society.\n\nThose moments are rare in the Sequels. The galaxy feels empty because the characters rarely interact with anyone but each other. When they do, the setting is typically there to provide some moral or lesson, rather than being a place that exists regardless of the characters' needs. Maz's bar, Canto Bight, and those random towns in TRoS are the only places that seem to have some kind of existence outside the story, but they're sparsely populated or, outside of a couple shots, you don't see the characters interacting with those environments organically.",

The mos eisley cantina in the OT or coruscant in the prequels are perfect examples of that. The sequels are so focused on the main characters that the world sort of fades into the background. And the core story of the sequels is the weakest of the trilogies, definitely not enough to carry the films without world building.",

She had a staff in TFA and was obviously very good with it, and the Skywalker lightsaber breaking was THE opportunity. After TLJ she would learn of Leia's Jedi history, and would use her lightsaber to repair the Skywalker saber, creating her dual bladed lightsaber. Just like Luke did before, but this time fitting for her skill set. A child could've written this, and I know that because I literally fucking did.\n\nThey couldn't even get it right after the movie was over, her new lightsaber is still single bladed, despite looking damn near identical to Maul's saber, minus the length. Even her fake sith saber was double bladed. It's infuriating to no end.\n\nEdit: u/taulover awakened me to the concept of a Polearm and I think that's an absolute perfect choice for her!",

Lightsabers are magical by virtue if being an actually glowing weapon that cuts through everything, they don't need personalities like Wands from Harry Potter.\n\nEpisode 7 should have recovered Luke's Lightsaber which he cast aside when he went on his pilgrimage/exhile. Rey (and ideally Finn) by episode 9 would need to forge her own unique lightsaber as befitting a Padawan who is ready to become a knight, that's how Luke did it. And obviously while her lightsaber may take some design cues from Luke's Saber, as Luke was influenced by Obi-Wan's Saber, her staff should likewise be prominent in the design. Honestly I thought the whole purpose of her staff was for it to make sense when she would eventually make her saber.\n\nOne of my favorite moments in epsiode 8 was seeing the weapon that cut down so many padwans being ripped in half so it could never be used again, but no JJ Abrams had to put a metal bandaid on it instead of just having Rey construct her own Saber. Heck have the opening heist be all about recovering Jedi artifacts from smugglers with a great reference of someone saying \"they belong in a museum\" and having Rey reply \"No, they belong to the Jedi\".",

He had Windu\u2019s lightsaber like a collectors item and would pretend to be a Jedi with it, or something along those lines. It was pretty funny, but far more intriguing and characterized than what we got lol (even if he does come off as basically a stereotypical weeb in the script)",

And then we capture them one after another slowly getting to bigger and more dangerous ones till we end up trying to track down the T-rex and all that... \n\nAt least it would have made some sense and would have been a good drama with a decent plot that builds on its own to a climax. Have a sub plot of the government hunting down and killing them at the same time. So it is a race to save as many as possible. \n\nAfter all there is NO way the government allows dinos to run around the world, way too dangerous. As the Malta scene showed....",

This allows a cinematic release to feel like an event again and not routine.\n\nWith the TV the problem is that Disney plus is a black hole that needs a steady stream of content, I think they have no choice but to continue shoveling content into that beast. Their best bet i think is to vary the mandalorian and character recognition spin offs with more risky projects like Andor which could show the seeds for expansion when the returns on the mandoverse inevitably diminish.\n\nAs for Indiana Jones, well evel Spielberg and Lucas couldn't revive that one, I feel it was doomed from the start.",

Firstly theres the fact that the OT had a single visionary filmmaker at the helm, guiding the entire trilogy versus the Sequels being made in a relay race by very different filmmakers and writers with nobody at the helm. Then theres the fact that the OT was the very first SW, allowing unlimited freedom, compared to the Sequels which begin seven movies in to a very long story in a well established universe. Then theres the problem with TFA being very much a part one of three and acting as a set up for a trilogy compared to ANH which worked well as a stand alone film. If you're going to use the first film as a set up movie, its pretty important that theres some kind of plan for where everything is going. \n\nEither way, they should have realized what was going to happen.",

TLJ and Andor prove how successful they can be when they do that.\n\nFan demand is not a bad thing, the best new Star Trek for instance, Strange New Worlds exists pretty much due to it.\n\nI agree with what you have posted, with one caveat. Too much emphasis has been put on fan*boys.* The opinions of loud fanboys has been given an oversized influence. The Sequels basically dumping the prequels, because fanboys hated it (while having committed the trilogy to memory and spend thousands of USD equivalent on prequel gear). The very existence of *Solo* and TBOBF was so fanboys who had for two decades said that \"they wanted these instead of the prequels\". And what do you know, there wasn't enough material for either to be made properly (even though I am glad both got made).\n\nOTH, Rogue One and Andor, stiff which built upon what was previously there were awesome. And this despite being Interquels, which has the problem of being hemmed in by both what came before and is to come after.",

Didn't people who hate the prequels cite how Boba Fett shouldn't have his life explored in detail as one of the many reasons they didn't like the prequels?\n\nAnd growing up with two decades of prequel hate, I never once saw anyone say they wanted a Solo movie. The first time I even saw it referenced was a rumour a month or so after the Disney sale that Iger wanted to do it. Which was met with a unanimous \"what? Why?\" from the fanbase.  \n\nInfact, the only reason people wanted an Obi Wan spin off and clamoured hard for it was because of the Solo movie rumour. It was born from the logic of: \"If you want to do a spin off with an existing character, set between the PT and the OT, with an actor you don't have to recast, who is beloved by the audience and who is the right age for the story that can be told in that era, why do Solo when Obi Wan is right there?\".",

I don\u2019t think people who grew up with the prequels had the same sorta connection. I grew up with OT being my Star Wars, but the prequels were also cool (too late to see OT in the theater by a while). I never got really into BF and I was interested in Han only until the prequels came out because I read the books. But if you were 10 years older than me, these were the stories they always wanted.",

They're already starting on the backfoot with a character from a series of movies so many people dislike and was plummeting at the box office by its end. They'd have been far better off to make a fresh start with a completely new set of characters in a new era. Worked for the Mandalorian. Then if they actually start making good films again, then go back and make a Rey movie if they must.",

Just do something different.",

Only one of those movies was a flop, and that was Bob Iger's fault for insisting it be released in May, not December. Outside of the movies, the franchise has earned billions more through merchandising, books, comic books, video games, theme parks, etc. I'm sure that the 4.05 billion dollar purchase price has been made back and generated some profit",

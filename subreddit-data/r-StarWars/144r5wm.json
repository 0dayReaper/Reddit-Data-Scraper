What i wanna talk about is, no matter how hated the sequels are, even then some haters have moments of it that they enjoyed at least. \n\nMight be a fight, might be a dialogue, might be an air battle, might be a song by the legend John Williams, might be a scene with beautiful cinematography, you pick.\n\nSo, what was your favorite thing about the so controversial sequels?",

Just Poe.\n\n- In VII at least, I thought Kylo was a badass villain who might even rival Darth Vader at some point.\n\n- The fight between Luke and Kylo in VIII is one of the best, if not the best fight in the franchise.\n\n- As much as I dislike IX, I appreciate them showing a yellow lightsaber in live-action, and I honestly think Rey should have wielded one as early as VII.\n\n- Giving Finn a lightsaber in VII was a great subversion of tropes, it's too bad he didn't get to keep it.\n\n- The planet and location design is mostly great. Kef Bir, Starkiller Base and Exegol were true standouts to me. My one complaint is the abundance of desert planets that are just Tatooine again.",

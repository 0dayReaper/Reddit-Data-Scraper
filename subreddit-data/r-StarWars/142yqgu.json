    "postText": "lets say kenobi isn't fast enough to pull the blaster with the force and before he could deflect the laser blast with the force, or jump, grivious shoot at him, then he managed to get to his ship but not before get kenobi lightsaber (and killing cody) how the rest of the story i got 2 scenarios  \nfirst scenario: he wents to get fixes and afew lightsabers before going to mustafar and arrives when vader already killed the separatist leaders and is talking with padme (since kenobi didn't appears anakin is about to choose go with padme) and attacks both of them, and starts a fight bettween falle anakin, and grivious completed fixed   \n\n\nsecond scenario: grivious decides to go mustafar and wait in there and gets the transmision of palpatine and waits there with the separatist leaders, and once vader/anakin arrives he starts to kills them and they both have a fight (note grivious didn't got fixed and only has kenobi saber) in this scenario, grivious is not going to escape, so what next will happen with the history",

If kenobi died, The jedi would be so focused on defeating grevious that they wouldn\u2019t have given much attention to palpatine for order 66 to happen, so they would have sent others(like anakin) to fight grevious. \nEven if they did, they would still have probably sent anakin and the 501st to fight grevious, due to other Jedi masters currently fighting elsewhere. Anakin would have also wanted to fight grevious to avenge his friend. So with anakin being off world, mace windu would have killed palpatine without anakin\u2019s intervention. Anakin then probably wouldn\u2019t have fallen to\nthe dark side entirely, order 66 wouldn\u2019t have happened, Padme and the remaining jedi (besides the three that palpatine killed) would have survived, and the clones would probably still be serving the Jedi. Regarding grevious, anakin would probably have killed him.\nThe separatists leaders would have been arrested by the 501st.\nIn the case of which they only go to arrest Palpatine after the separatist defeat, it\u2019s highly likely that more Jedi would have gone, and I don\u2019t think even Palpatine would stand a remote chance against both yoda and windu.",

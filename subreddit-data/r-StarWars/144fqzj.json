Definitely not.  \n\nJust for starters: we need to find out what happened to Ezra, see the canon version of Luke's Jedi temple, and do more with the Old Republic.",

I just watched Rebels finally and I\u2019m very interested to see what became of Ezra, I just played Jedi Survivor and Cal has grown on me a lot and I\u2019m excited to see his story, I\u2019ve always like Ahsoka and am eager for her story to continue, and the list goes on. Now if they\u2019ll do a good job of telling these stories is a different story. Only time will tell.",

Mando season 3 was still a massive hit despite the streaming point and people finally catching on to the formulaic structure. \n\nJedi Survivor was a huge hit (atleast for those of you not stuck waiting for the PC version to work). Ahsoka has alot of hype. Ridley's coming back. \n\nYes, Star Wars is doing great right now.",

You have a lot of shows and movies but the quality just isnt there.Manybprojexts feel rushed incoherent and sometimes just font make sense.Of course there are exceptions like the brilliant Andor and the popular Mandalorian,but that's about it. Personally I hate it when I have to turn my brain off to enjoy a film or series and Star Wars seem to go that route. As far as the milking goes,of course Disney is going to release as many movies shows it can,but the quality is going to be the same,mediocre and generic as Marvel.",

Indeed, the character played by Daisy Ridley in the sequel trilogy grew from one of Mr. Lucas\u2019 original ideas.. but of course it\u2019s also reasonable to assume that one or Mr. Lucas\u2019s problems with TFA could be that the character development of the Jedi girl was too derivative (I could be wrong in this regard of course, but it\u2019s possible).\n\nMy thoughts on the movie differ from GL quite a bit actually. Assuming that all my views coincide with his just because he created the whole thing is a very simple-minded assumption to make btw. Star Wars is more than just George Lucas -there\u2019s no single authority. \n\nAnyways have a nice day!",

Just an incredible 2 hour experience that showcases the spirit of what Star Wars is all about.  I cared more about these characters I spent only 2 hours with than I did any of the characters we saw in the sequels or Solo.  Just my personal experience.",

It ends on a near perfect note so you really end up loving it because the third act is absolutely superb and couldn\u2019t nail the landing any better.\n\nThe first two acts however are not at all of that quality, especially the very first act. It\u2019s a mess that jumps all over the place and if it wasn\u2019t for the constant title cards of where we are at the time, you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with it. It moves at lightspeed. Luckily the second act is already a lot more focused and as mentioned before, the third act is utterly fantastic. \n\nThen when you rewatch it the next time you go through that same journey again of \u201dthis isn\u2019t quite as good as I remembered\u201d to \u201dgod damn I love this movie.\u201d It\u2019s an endless cycle lol.\n\nAlso just a small personal nitpick, I think it has way too many cameos in it and most of them aren\u2019t particularly clever ones.",

I don't much like it and feel it is too erratic in the first half with thinly drawn characters (aside from Baze and Chirrut, who are still thinly drawn but their actor's chadscter work infers a much richer backstory than Cassian or Jyn.) the big spectacle at the end is incredibly satisfying but as you say, almost feels like a way to make you forget about the opening. \n\nAndor is much superior to Rogue One in that regard, though I feel both \"suffer\" from being \"good Sci fi, but not great Star Wars\". I like my Star Wars a bit campy and fun, BUT the great thing about Star Wars is that there's something for everyone. Just because it's not for me doesn't mean others more into the more grounded SW are wrong.",

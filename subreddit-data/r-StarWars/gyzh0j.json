Same with seeing how it was a very clear influence to Game of Thrones as well.\n\nEdit: I would say to anyone looking to read Dune: The first, maybe, tenth of the book is really confusing. It takes several chapters before you can sort of wrap your head around what\u2019s going on. But it eventually settles down and it\u2019s good. But you sort of have to power through the first bit and pay attention even though you don\u2019t totally know what you\u2019re paying attention to.",

Some of these works are beyond the scope of copy right and so he somehow feels less inclined to be humble about his own plagiaristic tendencies.  Dune was certainly a literary influence on George Lucas along with a great deal many other works of literature and media.\n\nHow could every piece of literature read by any individual not be an influence on their life through their thoughts and experiences?  A person would need to be brain dead, incredibly strong willed, or disillusioned to prevent leverage upon their own thoughts from exposure to others artistic work.  That's not just inclusion into ones work but also exclusion.  An individuals ability to create fiction cannot be expected to rely only on their own real world experiences less we all be subjected to a torrent of familiar mediocrity sparsely spattered with delusion and craze.\n\nThere is a level of these instances in every storied culture, but it is not always the desired escape that one may wish to take when delving into the world of another's imagination - or in this case reflection of their own real world experiences.  Escapism is certainly voyeuristic but it also may require a level of fantasim impossible in reality.  Human imagination breaks the confines of the universe and relating that to one another many times requires familiarity.  A child dreaming for the ability to preform magical and fantastic abilities is not a new story.\n\nDenying influence on a creative thought from digestion of another's work would be like denying one's ability to breath similarly to another's respiration.  Every person may be unique and each story unique in its own way, but there are, and will always, be similarities.  Exceptions and uniqueness sometimes require assimilation.  Frank Herbert should understand that as a science fiction writer.",

It was great to see Star Wars back on screen, and even if the film pulled a lot of plot beats from ANH, hey, at least we got to see Han and Leia and more of that universe. It left you excited for what was going to come after.\n\nTLJ was the most original and daring of the three. Sure it took paths none of us really expected (or actually wanted), but aside from some bad pacing issues it was a very watchable film. I was on the edge of my seat from the moment Rey left Ach-To. It felt the most like one of the Original Trilogy films to me.\n\nTROS was just a hot mess. I liked parts of it, but there was just too much in there. The whole movie could have been a trilogy in and of itself. Everything went by too quickly because they had to wrap it all up. I don't HATE it, but it's by far the weakest from a plot standpoint and in character rationale.",

It wasn't the most original of them, but it was the closest to a Star Wars film. At the time it came out, I was disappointed it was too much like ANH, but I was reasonably optimistic that they could improve on the series in the next two films. My expectations weren't very high, and while I wouldn't say it ever exceeded them, it didn't make me pessimistic.\n\nTLJ was, as you said, the most original and daring. Overall, it could have been good in its own universe, but too much of it seemed set specifically on \"inverting\" expectations, and not in a good way. Viewers expected something great from Luke, so he was turned into junk. Viewers expected something great from Snoke, so he was made disposable. Viewers expected Finn and Poe to be major characters, so they were made into comic relief and almost completely unimportant respectively. Viewers expected Rey to be trained by Luke to become somewhat proficient, so they made her train herself and become nearly unstoppable right out of the gate. Overall, it seemed to dispose of the most important parts of both the Original Trilogy and TFA for no good reason. It was also so heavy with political and social commentary that it felt like Rian Johnson had watched a Blomkamp marathon before writing Star Wars and decided Blomkamp was too subtle.\n\nTROS has basically no redeeming factors and is somehow the worst Star Wars of all, possibly including the Christmas Special, which at least had the Boba Fett cartoon.",

It was anarchist fanfiction. The core message was, *dulce et decorum est* is a waste of life, war is a racket, and the Force belongs to everybody. Then I assert Disney demanded a whiplash-inducing return to the status quo. How the script should have ended, if you took Vonnegut's advice and guessed with the last twenty pages missing, is with nearly everybody dying and the rebellion surging in response. Not martyrdom - but a transition from 'she's got this' to 'oh, *we've* got this.' \n\nEpisode 7, meanwhile, is the sort of navel-gazing where an unpowered droid gets a lingering shot, panicked rifling through a drawer pauses to consider an irrelevant ball, and the existence of holograms is somehow surprising - because the audience cares. It makes no sense to the narrative or the characters. These could be trivially fixed, too: leave R2 visible in the background of a shot, as dramatic irony, while someone laments they have no source of information on Luke's whereabouts. Someone could literally trip over it. (Over him? ... over them?) The hey-remember-this training ball floats in midair, so just have it do that when Finn chucks it over his shoulder. It could later zap Chewie and get destroyed in response. The chess thing is such a missed opportunity for the used-future aesthetic. It should be as surprising as sitting on a TV remote. Finn should just roll his eyes and lean through it to turn it off, instead of acting as an audience insert. Or, if the intent is to make him jump - have one of the pieces attack him. Bump table, tiny monster swings holographic club, Finn flinches. Surely somebody had similar notes while this bazillion-dollar project was under way. \n\nEpisode 9... yeesh.",

And I thought the Rian Johnson trilogy was canceled. I\u2019m curious to see what he can do with his own isolated trilogy that isn\u2019t tied to expectations to subvert. And hopefully with a full plan from the beginning that he can execute without interference.",

I haven't heard anything about it after Disney announced they were putting a lot of the star wars projects on hold. I'd honestly be surprised if it happens. Not to mention, the \"fan base\" isn't exactly clamoring for more RJ star wars, at this point it just seems like a bad business move on Disney's part if they were to give it a green light, which there is zero concrete indication from the past year or so that it's even a possibility.",

You get way more story out, you can flesh out villains without killing them off in one film, then they can go to theaters as movies for the big events. Like a fantastic 4 movie would probably be massively successful if it started with 1 or 2 seasons of a tv show before they do a movie. Doing seasons of Spider-Man with the villains as the focus then use the Spider-Man movies as the end to that act. With Star Wars they can show multiple battles in the trenches with showing the Jedi and sith sparsely. Then use the movies for the massive attacks instead of cramming 4 battles into quick 5-10 minute pieces and a massive attack at the end there.",

Having to watch supplementary shows would create a bigger barrier to entry for the movies.

Mando S1 right now is about 5 hrs 30 minutes if I did the math right (which I probably didn't) compared to about 6 hrs in an half with each trilogy. Same goes with games, that said I think there is this stigma that tv productions can't get the same quality as a film can.

That always gives the movie some weight and often feels more \"real\" than a generic happy ending, no matter which direction would be more realistic. It also doesn't need some cathartic moment for the main character or entire story arc, and neither does it need to deal with canon lore of the characters. Personally I liked it the most but with everything else it also had the easiest footing of being a standalone movie instead of having to fit its place in an EU.",

Mando is the FIRST show they made for the platform, and it's a mostly original pitch with no pre-conceived notions of what it's up to nor where it's going to go.\n\nSo of course, seeing the success of Mando, the next projects Disney+ pitches are...\n\nAn Obi Wan show. Oh, and a Cassian Andor show.\n\n\"Coming soon to Disney+: RECOGNIZABLE NAME: THE TV SHOW\".\n\nI don't doubt you can make a great show about Kenobi, or Cassian. But what I love about Mando isn't that it's about something recognizable (tho it is, Boba Fett armor and all of that), it's that it's the brainchild of Jon Favreau.\n\nI sincerely doubt anyone came to the table and went \"Guys my dream project, the thing I've been wanting to make since I was a kid, is a show about Obi Wan kicking ass on Tattooine\".\n\nWe need passion, not ideas that are easily markettable because fans meme existing characters so much. We need more people like Jon Favreau pitching their own wonderous Star Wars projects. Imagine how boring our world would be if George Lucas had been inspired by Samurai movies and Westerns into making... a Samurai movie. Or a western.\n\nHe didn't. He made something of his own, merely INSPIRED by those things.\n\nImagine how much better this slate would've been if the next shows after The Mandalorian were stuff even more out there. A random Jedi getting enroped into something during the era of the Clone Wars. Or a random droid deciding he wants to lead a freedom fighting group against some government local to his planet. You could even do bigger stuff, but stuff that hasn't been done in current canon, like a story set during the Old Republic (or maybe a retelling OF Kotor) Etc etc etc.",

Rian\u2019s continued success has only further proven that.\n\nI don\u2019t understand fans who want star wars to be like marvel. We have yet to see what kind of staying power those films have. For the most part, they\u2019re bland and safe. If you want Star Wars to be like marvel - I hope you enjoy ROS, because JJ played it very safe there. Personally, it\u2019s my least favorite Star Wars film for that reason.",

Granted, I enjoy a lot of the MCU films, so my opinion is somewhat skewed. However, between Infinity War and Endgame they showed how you can have fun with your established lore, subvert expectations, payoff plotlines that have been years in the making and give fans a decent film that doesn't polarize an avid fanbase. No movie will please everyone, especially not people as critical as hardcore fans of a series. But somehow, Marvel was able to keep most people interested, at least through Phase 4. As you say, we'll see how this next arc goes, but so far I wish the Star Wars leadership had taken a read of Marvel's playbook when they started, instead of waiting til the need was more dire.",

Rascals, Jedi, Senators/Royalty who put boots on the ground, etc.\n\nI will give you an example of one change that would have made Phantom Menace better.  \n\n*Anakin loses the pod race.*  By losing the pod race, Qui-Gon needs to get this kid back to the Jedi Council, so they make a plan to escape Tatooine.  And narrowly escape Watto and Maul.\n\nThen at the end of the movie, Anakin pilots a starfighter, and now you don't know if he's going to lose like he did on Tatooine.  This time he can pull it together, because he's grown.  And boom, he destroys the Trade Federation ship.  And narrowly escapes while doing it.\n\n4, 5, Rebels, Clone Wars, and Mandalorian all have narrow escapes.  And Rogue One may have the most heart pounding narrow escape there is in the entire franchise.",

The idea of \"cultural diffusion\" where you don't seek the root of something great but merely attempt to emulate it. It's why something like Eragon exists, which is a boldfaced copy of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings because he was attempting to emulate the same feel. Without going back to read Norse Sagas or look at Westerns, the way that the story is expressed is inevitably going to be similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't believe in cultural purity - all things are built upon influence - but there are more base aspects of genre than others. The closer you get to the source, the greater chance you have to find leeways for your own identity. I see this the most in sci-fi, where ideas can be more or less vividly expressed the better versed an author is in the genre.",

    "postText": "In the past year or so, I have noticed a significant increase in the number of clickbait Star Wars videos on YouTube. They all have these crazy titles and eye-catching thumbnails only to be a video about something small. Most people don't seem to mind, but they really bother me for some reason. There are 2-3 creators who I'm thinking of specifically, I'm sure you know who they are.\n\nCan\u2019t wait for the next video to tell us about why Palpatine was TERRIFIED of Rick the Door Technician.\n\nAlso, I want to say a huge thank you to all the thoughtful YouTubers who spoiled Jedi Survivor for us. Saved me so much time from playing the game myself!\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s nice to see how many people feel the same way. I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t talking about this.",

It's accepted truth among those circles.\n\nThey are just blatantly justifying their feelings with lies as a coping mechanism. It's so much easier to just accept that she has little to do with the quality of the projects and the shows/movies are hit or miss.\n\nI get blaming her for wider problems like the Sequel trilogy but thinking replacing her is going to fix everything is just silly.",

That's a totally unreasonable expectation to have, for anything in life.\n\nIt's okay for it to be okay. Some will be good. A few will be great. Some will be underwhelming. Some will be good for others, but not your flavor. Or vice versa. Some will be a letdown. If you're lucky you might get really really pumped about one or two. None are going to be crimes. None are deliberately made badly as a conspiracy to make \"true fans\" feel insulted. None are \"literally trash.\" None are going to kill the franchise. And hating it doesn't make you a superior fan to someone else. I'm sorry, but those opinions are ridiculous.",

I saw a video titled something like \u201cMark Hamill is DONE with Star Wars\u201d and it was just quoting an interview where he said he wanted to move on and let a younger actor reprise the role instead of using deaging, but from that headline it sounds like Hamill was pissed about something Disney did.

His content opened my eyes to the \"truth\" and gave me hope that Dave and John were going to be the saviors of Star Wars and fix the sequels with their TV shows and Kathleen Kennedy became the scapegoat and villain.\n\nOne day I expressed some of the things I'd learned about Kathleen Kennedy on one of the star wars subs and a user commented and very politely suggested that I was listening to the wrong source and I suddenly realized I'd been had! I felt sick. It was 2020 so things like Qanon were ripe and I know its not truly comparable in scope, but I felt like I'd been scammed or brainwashed into believing toxic misinformation and I was super embarrassed. Couldnt believe I'd bought in but just goes to show that its much easier to manipulate people when involving things they have strong emotional attachments to.\n\nSo yea... Fuck Mike Zeroh",

Some of the \u201chow she differs from, is similar to, challenges, and compliments Anakin\u201d stuff was really good IMO.

Not only such format gives absolutely no information what video is about (and often it's about basically nothing, like unconfirmed leak or out of context interview), but thumbnail is often completely unrelated to it\n\nI don't really have an issue with YouTubers taking small details, analyzing them and making theories, as long as videos are made with effort (are informative, grounded and creator made a lot of research). But spam of clickbait videos is what makes me genuinely mad, and it has gotten so much worse in recent years",

I think it was supposed to be a video on the flaws of the Mandolorian before season 3. But he opened with fat-shaming an x-wing fighter (who I believe was also one of the directors or writer) even though I believe in the original series there were also heavy set actor in the x-wings, right? \n\nLike, instead of going into an actual analysis on the flaws of the Mandolorian (which even though I love the Mando, I really like analysis videos), he just goes into how much he hates that a writer/director had the gall to cameo as an x-wing pilot while being fat and it ruined his immersion. I can't imagine what he saw as flaws for the rest of it (since I didn't finish the video) if that was the first thing he brought up. I get not liking a cameo, but it wasn't that bad to ruin the whole series, and I can't imagine being so aggravated by it that he needed to be such a dick.  Being a dick about a personal dislike is what specifically just made me turn him off and try to avoid his videos, but now I don't remember who it was.",

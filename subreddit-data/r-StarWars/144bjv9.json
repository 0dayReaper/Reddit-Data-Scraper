    "postText": "To be clear this is about the new Thrawn from Rebels, not the original.\n\nThe Thrawn we see is in an Empire that had not yet lost a significant battle to the Rebels. He pushes the Defender project and builds the production facility on Lothal. He even gets one of, if not the, top aces of the Empire. He then proceeds to get destroyed.\n\nHe commands during the first significant loss the Empire faces from the Rebels. He gets the ace pilot killed. He is utterly defeated in a time when the Empire isn't losing and loses tons of resources in doing so.\n\nIt would seem to me, that he would then be the laughing stock of the Imperial Navy. Before they start taking the Rebellion as a credible threat, this guy already lost to them, and badly. I can't see Imperials still viewing him well, or at least most Imperials.\n\nThough in the Mandalorian they seem to view him highly. They even talk about his return like the second coming. A feeling of, 'everything will be fine when Thrawn returns.' This seems odd to me given his situation.",

Everything from retconning the superior CWMMP, to sticking his precious OC all over the timeline, even going as far as resurrecting her. He also sacrifices good storytelling for nostalgia, cameos, callbacks, and references e.g. canonizing Stormtroopers being bad shots and so on. Man I hate it when Star Wars becomes meta.",

The officers within the imperial navy were always trying to one up each other in order to gain more power through there positions. Most in the navy didn\u2019t respect thrawn or understand how he was granted his station to begin with. The people who served under thrawn had great respect for him even though he wasn\u2019t a human. If anything, I\u2019d feel that the rest of the imperial navy was glad he was out of the way because it would allow themselves a better chance at promotion and even the attention of the emperor.",

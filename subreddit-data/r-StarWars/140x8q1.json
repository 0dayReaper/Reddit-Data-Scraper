    "postText": "So I finished rewatching all of the clone wars and I\u2019m currently rewatching Rebels. In rebels Season 3 episode 11 Maul is keeping the Dark Saber on Dathomir. But how did he get it back? At the end of the Clone Wars, Ahsoka never gave Maul a lightsaber and he got off the ship without finding one\u2026how did he get it back? Is there a comic about this or is this something we just kinda have to accept?",

            "comment": "It was confiscated by Palpatine in season 5, and Maul was imprisoned. A group of Mandalorians loyal to Maul, including Gar Saxon and Rook Kast, raided the prison and freed him. Some time later, in season 7 we see Maul again with his double-bladed lightsaber and in Rebels we see the Darksaber on Dathomir. So it can be assumed that it was recovered during the prison raid and placed on Dathomir for safekeeping until later found and recovered by Ezra and Sabine.",

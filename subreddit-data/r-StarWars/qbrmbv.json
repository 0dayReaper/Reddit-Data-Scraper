To preface, Drew Hart and I were given all of one week to accomplish this. He had a suit of Din armor and I had a suit of Boba armor in our stash so we mashed them together, threw on some clone shins, and called it a day. Drew did an insane job on the flight suit as well. It's all hand stitched. He did the bulk of the heavy lifting on this build and the flight suit is the most impressive part. Truly the hardest part of the build. \n\nThe helmet was a blast! I took some photos with it before giving it to snoop because how could I not lol [https://imgur.com/gallery/DrznaVR](https://imgur.com/gallery/DrznaVR)\n\nThe jewelry is milled aluminum with Swarovski crystals. Costume dept didn't request us to make it but he loved it so much, he kept it! The costume team on this project was insanely talented and I'm lucky to be involved. I make a few small cameos in the video as well. I have the Tech (Bad Batch) helmet painted green with an orange stripe.",

He had a suit of Din armor and I had a suit of Boba armor in our stash so we mashed them together, threw on some clone shins, and called it a day. Drew did an insane job on the flight suit as well. Truly the hardest part of the build. \n\nThe helmet was a blast! I took some photos with it before giving it to snoop because how could I not lol https://imgur.com/gallery/DrznaVR\n\nThe jewelry is milled aluminum with Swarovski crystals. Costume dept didn't request us to make it but he loved it so much, he kept it! The costume team on this project was insanely talented and I'm lucky to be involved. I make a few small cameos in the video as well. I have the Tech (Bad Batch) helmet painted green with an orange stripe.",

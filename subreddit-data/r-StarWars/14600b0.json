                    "comment": "I was 6 when I saw Phantom Menace in theaters. I had grown up on the original trilogy. Other than Qui Gon getting stabbed and Maul getting cut in half at the end, Phantom Menace is arguably the most young child-friendly Star Wars movie. The original trilogy is overall much darker and more violent (Ben cutting off a guys arm + blood, Beru and Owen getting torched down to the bone, Han shooting Greedo in the face, Han getting tortured on Bespin, Vader choking everybody all the time, Luke and Vader cutting each other\u2019s hands off, Palpatine zapping Luke, Leia choking Jabba to death, Luke cutting the phantom Vader\u2019s head off, implied scary needle in Leia\u2019s prison cell, whole planets getting blown up, Dak dying in the snowspeeder and then getting squished, basically every scene with Vader being pretty scary and intense, dying Ewoks, etc. etc.). So it really depends on the kid. If a young kid can handle the original trilogy, they can probably handle phantom menace.\n\nMy four year old son just finished watching the OT with me, he\u2019s a sensitive guy so a number of scenes did scare him a bit but he was able to watch them without a problem and it opened up a lot of opportunities for kid-level discussions about complicated themes. He hasn\u2019t seen Phantom Menace yet but I wouldn\u2019t be worried about him watching it. It\u2019s moreso Revenge of the Sith and possibly Attack of the Clones that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready for. Some kids don\u2019t do well with anything intense at a young age, though, so it isn\u2019t one size fits all. It basically comes down to if you want your kid to see Maul get bisected, and if you\u2019re willing to say \u201cno\u201d when he/she wants to move on to later movies that are more intense.\n\n(Edit to say that if you aren\u2019t sure, just watch the movie yourself once and note the moments you wouldn\u2019t want your kid to see so you can cover his/her eyes up or whatever. I used to watch the first two Jurassic park movies with my dad on VHS all the time from a very young age, but he made me close my eyes for the part where Gennaro gets eaten off the toilet and the part where the guy get\u2019s split in half by two T Rexes in the sequel)",

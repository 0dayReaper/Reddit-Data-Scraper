Same as with the \"Holdo Maneuver\" (not starting a fight, just an example).\n\nIn literary terms, this is known as \"plot/character drift.\"\n\nThey needed to raise the stakes for the final confrontation and show the immense power that Palpatine had amassed by draining the life force from Ben and Rey (which he learned from Plageius, who learned it from his master). So they \"upped\" his power to fit the situation, as needed by the plot.\n\nThis happens to most major franchises as the perception of the characters and situations shift. People think of Force wielders as \"Space Wizards\" now, so they can just do whatever they want - even though this was *not* their intended depiction.\n\nThey're more like the Bene Gesserit from *Dune* or Gandalf from LOtR - very \"felt but not seen\" manipulations of the world around them - rather than, say, Harry Potter or an MCU character.\n\nHence the character/plot drift. They are what the plot needs them to be.\n\nYou could headcanon it to believe that the ships on Exegol, being powered by giant, Sith bled Kyber crystals, acted as conduits to enhance and redirect the Sith energy away and to their intended targets - something Kyber crystals had been able to do previously (it's how Lightsabers used to function in pre-Disney days).\n\nI'll get downvoted for this, probably, but there's a distinct shift/difference in the Jedi/Sith, and even Lightsabers, from what they were to what they are.",

All the way back in the OT you had Vader openly strangling multiple Imperials with the Force, or throwing pieces of Bespin at Luke rather than simply fighting him directly with his lightsaber, and the Emperor blasting lightning out of his fingers to torture Luke. Palpatine, in particular, is an excellent manipulator but also fully committed to blasting out the most visually spectacular power when his manipulations don't bear fruit. \n\nTrying to fry the Resistance with lightning after his attempts to cow the galaxy with his planet buster fleet is entirely on brand for Palpatine.",

Shit, Exar Kun sacrificed an *entire* species of humanoids (Massassi) to make himself, effectively, immortal. Palpatine also used a form of battle Meditation to keep his troops organized and focused during the Battle of Endor. It was his death that broke the Imperial lines since they didn't have his Force-manipulated coordination. \n\nHowever, what it is, is still Character / Plot drift. It doesn't change what the definition is and how it applies to Star Wars lol.\n\nPalpatine was not originally a Sith lord, nor even Vader's master until ESB. We know what he was through the original screenplay adaptation of \"Star Wars,\" published before the film was released in 77 (sold nearly 5 million copies within a year). Which matches up with the prequels in every facet - except for him being a Sith lord.\n\nThere was *never* a guarantee a sequel would happen, which is how we got *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* btw. So that book and the first movie were their original, \"pure\" depictions.\n\nWhen ESB was given the greenlight, these characters were expanded and how the Force could be manipulated was also expanded accordingly, because they had the chance to - so they did. That's still the definition of character/plot drift. Neither positive nor negative. \n\nThe \"on brand\" Palpatine you and I have now, is *not* the Palpatine as he was originally intended to be. Glad we have it, in some respects, but it is what it is.",

That said, the idea that everything other than ANH is \"drift\" seems to make the term so broad as to render it pointless. Telekinesis didn't exist in ANH, nor did high jumping or future sensing or lightning, but to label that as drift rather than development definitely carries connotations, regardless of your claim that it's neither positive nor negative. \n\nAnd even then, you have the dichotomy between the subtleties of Obi-Wan's light side usage, awakening Luke while he's alone or quietly bluffing past a checkpoint, with the open usage of Vader's dark side powers, strangling a high ranking Imperial in the middle of a conference or announcing to a non-Force user that he can feel someone's presence through the Force. Dark siders have always been happy to get showy with their abilities.",

We already saw in ROTJ when he used force lightning he directed it to only hit Luke, same in ROTS when he made it only hit Windu, in Lords of the Sith (a canon novel) he directed it to electrocute a small militia and only them, completely missing all his other troops. So it's not that far fetched that he would be able to emit a massive burst like this and only hit his enemies.",

                            "comment": "Carey Fisher talked about how unnatural the dialogue was in at least one interview. The original movie had its fair share of dialogue that was a mouthful. My understanding from the interviews I've watched is that Lucas wasn't great at working with actors to get them into the scene and was big for sticking to the script. I also don't think he liked reshooting scenes if he could help it. I'm curious if the on-set script changes in Empire Strikes Back frustrated him.\n\nOT had a lot of UK theatre actors so I feel like maybe it benefited from their ability to pick up a script and make it work? There was definitely some stilted and, at times, wooden dialogue but I think the actors might have just handled it better? Maybe all of the UK law mandated breaks that Lucas hated helped them to be fresh? Maybe people not taking the movie or Lucas super seriously helped?\n\nThe romance scenes in the prequel trilogy are the worst offenders while Empire Strikes Back had the most romance and was not directed by Lucas. It could be that he is just terrible at writing/directing romance scenes. Compare the moon of Endor scene in Return of the Jedi with any of the romance scenes in Empire Strikes Back. It was a rough scene.",

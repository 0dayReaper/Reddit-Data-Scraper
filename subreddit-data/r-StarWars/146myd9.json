    "postText": "I feel Like There Gonna Bring back The Stormtroopers back just to Make Boba Fett loom more like a badass cuz he was was dripping in season 2 of Mandalorian. Another thing I really want him to have a Lightsaber like in The Legends but and yes I know this is canon but still how awesome would it be, before you say he already has that wooden staff thing he could use that lightsaber as a last resort for more stronger opponents",

(Bring back the Stormtroopers back.)  Also, \u201cloom\u201d instead of \u201clook.\u201d  You can say \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cmore strong,\u201d but not \u201cmore stronger.\u201d  You should also end that last sentence with a period.",

Nostalgia is not a reason to make a tv show/movie. I promise it will never be as good as u want it to be.",

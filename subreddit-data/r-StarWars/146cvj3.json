I want to read more about star wars and get more in depth since i find interesting but i don't want to get confused or annoyed (if say vader could destroy a million ships in novels but can only destroy 5 in movie *stupid example but you get the jist*)\n\nFor example apparently starkiller is way too op in the games so it doesnt make too much sense to me that they would make him that op if he wasnt actually \ud83d\ude05",

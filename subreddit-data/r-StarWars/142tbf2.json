    "postText": "Sometimes when I rewatch a movie years later that had originally disappointed me I often enjoy it more and appreciate the things I originally liked without allowing the let down of the things I didn\u2019t to spoil it. Just rewatched TLJ on a plane and man this movie still sucks. I can list so many details and plot points that I didn\u2019t like but what really struck me was how few redeeming moments it had. Even with the other sequels and prequels there is plenty to hate on but they still delivered a healthy serving of amazing moments. TLJ on the other hand really left me struggling. I loved the throne room scene when Kylo kills Snoke and the Holdo maneuver was pretty sweet. There were a few chuckles and a nice moment with Luke and Yoda talking about the force. Crait had a cool look to it but very derivative of Hoth. Can\u2019t really think of anything else. By far the worst SW movie imo. What were some moments you appreciated/enjoyed (or really hated lol)?\n\n\nEdit: Ya\u2019ll whining that I said it\u2019s trash and sucks is soft. Relax! I said \u201cIMO\u201d and I\u2019m not exactly writing for The NY Times here. I\u2019m still open to your comments whether you liked it or not and assure you there\u2019s nothing \u201cunsafe\u201d about this space. That being said holy shit the Finn/Rose/Poe subplots were utter trash. They constantly act/converse as if they have seen all the other Star Wars movies and all their lines are being said to the audience rather than each other. Essentially it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. All of the social commentary and perspective is incredibly surface/cliche yet it\u2019s preaching on such a righteous pedestal as if it\u2019s some ground breaking point of view. Cinematography and set design were great tho.",

When you start with the second one it leaves no actual room for discussion and puts people on the defensive.\n\nI really enjoyed TLJ, it does not \"suck\" and is not \"trash\". I enjoy most of the character's story arcs - Luke's included - except for the Canto Bight part. That's only because it went nowhere because TROS dropped most of the plot threads like a hot potato. If they had extended Finn's development from it into the next movie it wouldn't fall so flat now for me. \n\nIt's also a visually stunning movie. The throne room, the Holdo maneuver, Ahch-to, and Crait are all *beautiful* cinematography. And Luke's walk out to confront Kylo Ren gives me chills every time!\n\nI don't mind if you don't like it - I'm not going to hate anyone for not enjoying something.",

                    "comment": "I would immediately agree that visually, this is the best-looking movie in the series by a wide margin. The cinematography is great, the locations and set pieces are stunning, and the color palet is striking with a lot of black or white voids being punctuated by stark colors like red or blue. This is a very well-made production. The cast is really giving it their all, the crew is doing great work, post is knocking it out of the park, but this movie also marks the start of that dumb tug-of-war between the directors, and boy does it show. To make matters worse the movie is tonally a complete disaster and when you stop and think about something as simple as how a character gets from one location to another, you realize this is likely a first draft. It needed another pass. There is a good story buried in here somewhere, but it's stuck under the weight of too many quips, a pointless series of subplots that have Rey and Finn running in circles for the entire runtime, and a cavalcade of dumb decisions from the rebels that ends with them partying on the Falcon even though all but like 30 of them died horribly and apparently no one in the galaxy gives a shit. Seriously, go back and watch the end of that movie again, and ask yourself if the tone they went with in any way fits the horrific series of tragedies the people on that ship just had to endure.",

            "comment": "I'd say it's definitely the most ambitious in terms of what it was trying to say, that Star Wars as a franchise should do more than just coast off of nostalgia, but the effectiveness of your story is judged not by your target, but your aim. It's tonally a mess, features a conflict so artificial that one can't help but come up with numerous solutions that don't end with the rebellion whittled down to the like 2 dozen people that make onto the Falcon, and undercuts its own message again and again by leaning on that nostalgia it's been criticizing. Like I genuinely find this to be the worst in the series specifically because it's trying so hard to have a point that it keeps undermining at every possible turn. I've seen people interpret that as looking for a happy medium between abandoning the past and clinging to it, but I just don't get that from the events of this movie. \n\nPlus, I will never not be mad at how they did my boy Luke dirty. You want Luke to be a washed-out fuckup? Sure, I can get down with that. It sounds like a great way to give him an arc about redisovering himself as he trains the next generation. You want him to raise his weapon to murder his sleeping nephew before the kid has even done anything wrong, make him refuse to engage in the plot, and then kill him off after he chats with Yoda about what a fuckup he is and taunts his nephew making him just a little more pissed and evil? No, dude, that isn't a logical progression at all. If that's what you're gonna do, you honestly should just not put him in the movie.",

Though not necessarily twists per se.\n\nBasically, I think TLJ has one of my favorite third acts of any Star Wars movie.\n\nThere are some criticisms of the movie I agree with (the Finn subplot felt a little too disconnected from the rest of the movie.  And overall giving Rey/Poe/Finn each their own subplot may have been one subplot too many).\n\nBut those things feel like nitpicks when you compare them to the really cool stuff.  And even within those criticisms I think there's stuff done well (Finn's subplot has a lot of redeeming qualities IMO).\n\nSo I rank TLJ pretty highly.  I feel about it pretty much how I feel  about Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith..   imperfect movies that have so much GREAT stuff in them that I don't really care that much.",

On my initial viewing I came out with mixed feelings and didnt really know how I felt about it. But on the second viewing I outright disliked it and it went down from there. \n\nJust a cynical, dull remake of ESB without all the things that made that movie so good, made by a director whose sole aim was to make a SW film with his own personal spin rather than making a chapter in the saga. Part of this annoying modern trend where writers want to be meta and subversive rather than just coming up with a good story with good characters.",

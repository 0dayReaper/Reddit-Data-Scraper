    "postText": "I only just got Jedi survivor today and have played about an hour and a half so far so please don\u2019t spoil anything. The game is fairly decent so far, nothing amazing but far from bad. My only real complaint would be the graphics and frame rate. I feel ea have went to far with it and it just doesn\u2019t run as smoothly as I would like. I am playing on a ps5 and have my setting set to performance mode and I still notice that in gameplay the frame rate randomly drops and in cutscenes it\u2019s the same if not worse. I honestly would of preferred fallen order\u2019s graphics and a clean smooth running game than the new advanced graphics with some choppy frame rate. Does anyone else feel the same or am I alone in this?",

My close friend refuses to play it in its current state on pc because of corrupted save file issues. Since I\u2019ve already finished it, I haven\u2019t been following patch related stuff. I assumed they may have got things smoothed out by now though.",

That\u2019s not counting all the game breaking bugs I encountered. \n\nI persevered though. Great game. Just needs a few more weeks of patches I think.",

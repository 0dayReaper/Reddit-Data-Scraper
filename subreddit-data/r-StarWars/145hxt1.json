    "postText": "I think most of us can agree Anakin\u2019s *The Clone Wars* portrayal sounds very different from how he does in the prequel trilogy. Compared to James Arnold Taylor, who is doing some measure of an Ewan McGregor impression when he voices Obi-Wan, Matt Lanter is pretty clearly doing his own thing with his character. Which is fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with his performance, but it does make me wonder.\n\nI\u2019m currently reading *Thrawn: Alliances*, which prominently features Anakin Skywalker in flashbacks. So to anyone else who\u2019s read that book or other prequel-era material, I ask you: when you read Anakin\u2019s dialogue, whose voice do you hear in your mind?",

I feel bad criticizing any of his impressions because he\u2019s done *so many* Star Wars books, and you can tell he\u2019s doing his very best every time. His Thrawn and Palpatine voices are actually pretty good. Anakin\u2026 not so much.",

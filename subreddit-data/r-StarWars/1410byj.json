In a seedy bar, the old man hires a desperate, incompetent drug smuggler to help them evade authorities.\n\nDuring their flight, the zealot grooms and recruits the teenager into his cult. Plans go awry, and the teen ends up on a potentially suicidal mission for an anti-government militia.\n\nLater, a different aging religious fanatic tries to recruit the young man to a different sect of the cult. Really, the whole thing is about different cults competing to recruit vulnerable youngsters.",

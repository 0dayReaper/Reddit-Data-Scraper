                    "comment": "__Forget the music career, OP's formula adds up into something incredible.__\n\nOriginal formula:\n\n    x + 4783 - x + 4v|VE| (x + 4)(f - 711) = A\n\nThrough basic Algebra, we can cancel out the two x's, doesn't matter what their values are:\n\n    4783 + 4v|VE| (x + 4)(f - 711) = A\n\nNext, we can FOIL out the two parentheses expressions:\n\n    4783 + 4v|VE| (xf - 711x - 4f - 2844) = A\n\nWell, what now u/TCJulian? We can't possibly fill in any of the other variables without other data. It certainly looks hopeless...\n\nHowever, if you do a little digging, you find that these letters are actually common variables found in physics!\n\n* _v_ commonly stands for [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity)\n* _V_ stands for [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage)\n* _E_ stands for [Young's Modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus), which is the measure of a solid materials stiffness\n* _f_ stands for [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction)\n* _A_ is peak [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude)\n\nThis is where things really start to get crazy. \nIf we can extrapolate that this formula has something to do with the Star Wars universe, then perhaps it might has something to do with space travel (since, you know, that is one of the major themes of the universe right?).\n\nCurrently, space shuttles that leave Earth travel at approximatley [17,500 miles per hour](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS472US472&amp;q=how+fast+do+spaceships+go&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj4Luol8_YAhVO2FMKHSjtCFYQvwUIJigA&amp;biw=1454&amp;bih=895).\nThis turns in about 7,823 m/s, which-guess what?- happens to be a measure of velocity. \n\nWe can plug that into the formula:\n\n    4783 + 31292|VE| (xf - 711x - 4f - 2844) = A\n\nOkay great! Now lets tackle voltage and Young's Modulus next.\n\nThe highest voltage ever recorded in history was created by the [Van de Graaff generators](http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/whats-highest-voltage-ever-made). \nClocking in at 25.5 megavolts (25,500,000), this would pretty much instantly vaporize you. It is feasible to assume starships of the future could achieve such voltages, so we will use this number in our calculation as well.\n\nOn the same vein, it is reasonable to assume that starship material is harder than our modern steel, but not as hard as diamond. \nSince Young's Modulus is a measure of a materials tensile strength, that puts _E_ at around 498 gigapascals.\nWith these new additions, this brings our forumal to:\n\n    4783 + 31,292 |(25,500,000)(498)| (xf - 711x - 4f - 2844) = A\n    4783 + 31,292 |12,699,000,000| (xf - 711x - 4f - 2844) = A\n    4783 + 397,377,108,000,000 (xf - 711x - 4f - 2844) = A\n    \nPhew, that number is quite ridiculous... what is that like 397 _trillion_ meters per second? That number can't possibly make sense... at that point you would be moving approximately 1,325,507 times faster than the speed of light!\n\nBut you see, we aren't finished with the equation yet. Now we have to incorporate friction, and the mysteries of dark matter scattered throughout the universe.\n\nWhen traveling through space at ridiculous speeds, space shuttles and the passengers onboard interact with matter they can't detect with their human senses.\nThis matter, which has been subject to many scientific debates and exploration, is already gaining evidence that [it exists and interacts with other matter in our universe](https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/new-evidence-that-dark-matter-could-be-self-interacting/).\nThis number is incredibly precise: 1,185.000000251472022 units of radiation friction. In order to find the correct velocity, we have add this variable to the equation:\n    \n    4783 + 397,377,108,000,000 (~1,185x - 711x - 4(~1,185) - 2844) = A\n    4783 + 397,377,108,000,000 (~1,185x - 711x - ~4,470 - 2844) = A\n\nWe are so close, but yet where do we go from here? The x variable could literally be anything. \n\nHmm, perhaps we need to look closer into the other variable amplitude...\n\n__And this is where it all comes together.__\n\nAmplitude is a measure of the magnitude of a variable's change over time. \nAmplitude is often used in the alongside the measurement of hertz, which normally uses the timescale of one second.\nIf we apply this same methodology to this formula, then we can make x = 1:\n\n    4783 + 397,377,108,000,000 (~1,185(1) - 711(1) - ~4,470 - 2844) = A\n    4783 + 397,377,108,000,000 (0.000000754416066)\n    4783 + 299,787,674.54\n    ~299,792,457 m/s\n\nDo you know what that number is? __That is the speed of light!__\n\n## OP's MUSICAL GENIUS CRACKED THE KEY TO HYPER SPACE AND BEYOND!!!\n\n__Edit: I am truly humbled by the Reddit Gold.

[It should be -7110.000000754416066.](http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=xf+-+711x+-+4f+-+2844+with+x+%3D+1%2C+f+%3D+1185.000000251472022) The -7110 has just vanished. I'm a bit sad if this is right as it was a gloriously magnificent bit of number fudging with correct maths up to that point. :'(",

                            "comment": "Your units are wrong.  Hertz are a measure of frequency, in SI base they 1 Hz = 1 *per* second, not one second.  It\u2019s easy to see why OP made the frequency variable x when f is already representing friction.  If we take the units now representing Hz correctly, then the units of A must change (and they could never have been m/s, as A is representing amplitude and not a velocity.)\n\nWe also need to break things into base units to get through the simplification of that polynomial since you can only add or subtract numbers with like units, and xf will not have the same units as a term with just x or just f.\n\nVolt=(kg\\*m^2 / s^3 \\*A) where A is amps \n\nE is a stress/strain ratio, expressed as Pa \\* (cm/cm). Obviously the strain units cancel and become dimensionless, so a Pa= kg / m \\*s^2  \n\nFriction is a force, so f=kg \\* m / s^2\n\nNow, plugging all that in and using the values you had above:\n\n4783 + 4 v(m/s) |V(kg m^2 / s^3 A) E(kg/m s^2 ) | [x(/s)f(kg m / s^2 ) - 711x(/s) + 4f(kg m / s^2) - 2844]\n\n4783 + 3.97 \\* 10^23 (kg^2 m^2 / s^6 A) [1185(kg m / s^3 ) - 711(/s) + 4740(kg m / s^2 ) - 2844] = A\n\nWhich gives:\n\n 4783 + 4.70\\*10^26 (kg^3 m^3 / s^9 A) - 2.82\\*10^26 (kg^2 m^2 / s^7 A) + 1.88\\*10^27 (kg^3 m^3 / s^8 A) - 1.13\\*10^27 (kg^2 m^2 / s^6 A) = A\n\nThis answer is completely different than the one you got, which is why units are important all through the equation solving process.  The answer isn\u2019t the speed of light (a simple logic check should show that amplitude =/= velocity).  This answer is in fact the amplitude of the hyperspace distortion effect caused by the entry of a capital ship into hyperspace.  Effects of such an entry on physical space can be seen [here.](https://i.imgur.com/lMNLmTB.gifv)",

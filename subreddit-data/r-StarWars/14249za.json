It totally worked.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just because its flashy. But in general, I put Star Wars on - and if he\u2019s looking towards the screen it\u2019s hard to have him look away.\n\nIt has caused a bit of a \u201cscreen time\u201d debate between me and my wife, though. Which she immediately stopped calling me out when she used her phone to get him to have a successful tummy time session lol.\n\nI dunno. It\u2019s either Star Wars or videos of Elmo. So we kind of have an idea of what his interests will be.",

Just yesterday the younger one asked to watch TFA, that'll happen in the next few days for sure. \n\nWe've only watched RotS once and my older one (almost 9) has only watched Rogue One a single time so far as well. Those ones, while solid entries just aren't fun, which is what brought me and kept me in the GFFA to begin with. I tried to watch RotS and Siege of Mandalore with them last fall and when we got to Anakin murdering Younglings the older one checked out and asked if we could shut it off. \n\nSo like I said start now with that OT and you'll have a fan on your hands for sure.

I found most of the movies slow and boring but had cool fight scenes, my love was mostly cemented by Lego Star Wars.\n\n\nI didn't really understand the themes that made Star Wars so good, and I operated on surface level knowledge for years. I completely misunderstood some parts even.\n\n\nI guess there's no right or wrong age, they will likely learn eventually. But I'd wait until they're a bit older so they can understand and care about what's happening on screen a bit more.\n\n\nAlso do NOT start with the Prequels like I did. Bad choice.",

So do more book and toys.\n\nMy son just turned 4 and now he's fully committed to Star Wars. He's home sick right and requested to watch ROTJ. This is the way.",

If you sit him down and formally introduce him to mommy or daddy's favorite movies, it might not interest him right away. Don't be disappointed if he doesn't love it immediately.\n\nWhen I introduced the younglings to Star Wars, they got bored and wandered away. My feelings were a little hurt, not gonna lie. And I think they sensed that disappointment, and they sort of side-eyed anything Star Wars for a little bit after that. It wasn't until I introduced my mom to The Mandalorian and they watched it with grandma that they started developing their own interest in it. One of them isn't really interested at all and that's fine too.",

She gets scared in shows and stuff pretty easily, so probably not ready for anything with even a bit of violence in it. I'm hoping to bring her into Star Wars when she is 7 or so, maybe start her with Rebels.  \nNote: We are one of those families that try to avoid screen time. When she was maybe 2 and a half (and stuck at home during Covid with her mom), she started watching some disney music videos, but no more than 2-3 a day. Then when she turned 3 we upped it a bit and closer to 4 we started allowing her to watch 1 episode of a show every night that she has behaved well, and a movie on the weekend if she had no incidents at school all week.",

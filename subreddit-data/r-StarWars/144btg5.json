The only time they met their connection to Luke was when Anakin showed up - strolled into the desert and murdered an entire tribe and retrieved his dying mother. That's kind of unnerving.\n\nYet they took him in and protected him. Even when a incensed force user shows up and they don't really stand a chance of fighting her off.",

I know Obi-wan and Owen had beef with each other in Legends, so I thought a situation where they'd be forced to work together would be hilarious and touching as both have the goal of \"protect Luke\" in mind and it'd be interesting seeing them both play off each other like that.",

It's so nice to hear two characters sharing their feelings and perspective on how they view themselves and each other, and you can tell the history between these fully fleshed out characters. Beru is a psychopath that likes to fight dark Jedi, and din is a blank slate that kinda talks at a baby yeed who also can't in turn react or interact with din. Din also is incredibly irresponsible with frogu. Kinda makes me question whether he actually cares or not.",

    "postText": "If you could rewrite any piece of Star Wars canon material to better reflect what came \\*later\\*, what would it be? I'm not talking about really changing the core material or anything. Just shoring up the many little spots that got strange in retrospect given what we learn later. Like removing the Luke/Leia kiss.\n\nFor me it'd probably retooling some of Obi-Wan's lines in A New Hope about the other people he knows. His \"certain point of view\" description of Vader &amp; Anakin, him not remembering R2, calling Vader \"Darth\", and so on. There's shoehorned explanations for a lot of that stuff, of course. But it's obviously all come up with after the fact to patch up things that just didn't exist yet when A New Hope was written. So I think I'd make those a bit more consistent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(To be clear, just to respond to the strawman in my head; obviously none of this sort of thing is really \"necessary\". The movies/shows/etc work fine as they are. Just thought it'd be a fun little exercise.)",

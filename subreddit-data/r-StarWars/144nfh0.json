    "postText": "Let's say the war with Thrawn ended in a strategic and political stalemate. A peace treaty between the New Republic and the Empire was signed. Palpatine did not somehow return. By the time the Vong arrive the political and militaristic situation of the galaxy is the same as if Thrawn was dead. The same goes to the Jedi Order.  \nHow would the Yuuzhan Vong war turn out if Thrawn was still alive when they attacked? Would it be easier for the New Republic and the Empire if he was still kicking?  \nHow do you think would the early stages of the war unfold?",

            "comment": "Thrawn has a pile of wartime strategy experience and is a decorated command officer, yes, but these are qualities in plentiful supply to the New Republic throughout the YV invasion. What set Thrawn apart was his keen insight into a species' culture and thought processes through their art.\n\nWhile the Yuuzhan Vong certainly have an artistic and romantic side, they don't produce \"art\" as we would describe it. To them, art is genetically grafting a new biot into existence, or engineering a more agonizing Embrace, or figuring out how to work a new slave species into their war machine.\n\nAll of that was intel the natives of the GFFA gathered months if not *years* into the war, and thus stripping Thrawn of most of his individual value.\n\nYes, he'd still be an asset, and a damn good field commander, but beyond finely-trained intuitions he would have found himself being pushed back just as hard and just as violently as any other military leader.",

MAybe they'd fair a bit better but the galaxy on the whole was woefully unprepared for what the vong were and jhust being a ReallyGoodTactician\u2122 would only blunt that so much",

I don't think Thrawn would be able to do anything against them because they're just so overpowered.",

Add in his willingness to think outside the box, he would have had defenses prepared already. The Chiss instead of late comers would have been involved from the beginning and his Hand empire would be as well trained and versed in Vong tactics as possible. \n\nAll that said there would be setbacks and losses but he would have overcome those.\n\nAnd he had the Night Hammer\u2026 just saying a cloaking SSD would have f\u2019ed some stuff up\n\nEdit\n\nHe also would have some hella commanders. Daala, Pellaeon, Soontir Fel, Jagged Fel. Those were top notch Imperials",

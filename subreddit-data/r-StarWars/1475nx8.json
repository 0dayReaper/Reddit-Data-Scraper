Every other time, like the games, they end up being slashed in the chest or something. \n\nLike it would be cool but it would have to be a mature game right?",

But its based on real sword play where you don't try to dismember the opponent but try to incapacitate them. You CAN dismember them, but it's not...the go to. You're trying to get them into the position you want them and make that  cut that'll end the fight. What you do after that is a different story",

I don\u2019t think it should be added to everything, but a darker game that\u2019s intentionally more brutal and a character and story that fits it, I would totally love it then. \n\nWould be sick to see an adaptation of the great sith wars or something (if they\u2019re still canon)",

Then it all got toned down once they realized they could make a killing off toys for kids. Either way is fine, but would be nice if we could get a mix of the two. There\u2019s a place for both. Vader\u2019s hallway scene in Rogue One was great because we get to see just how brutal and devastatingly deadly he is. Likewise, it would be nice to have a lightsaber-oriented Star Wars game where you could fully take advantage. I found the decapitation finishers so satisfying in Witcher 3 lol",

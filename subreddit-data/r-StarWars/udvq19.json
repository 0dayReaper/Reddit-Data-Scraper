One thing to keep in mind is they wrote the movies with the sequels in mind. Keep an eye out for fun easter eggs like in movie #2 they have a history exhibit of the wild west and Biff's relatives. The third movie takes place in the wild west. No spoilers.\n\nOh and the first movie predicted the 9/11 twin towers terrorist attack. \n\nWARNING THIS LINK WILL SPOIL THE MOVIES.\n\nThey're old movies but still so fun. \nhttps://youtu.be/P1ULjJ3EqyY for, uh, \"proof.\"",

The characters appeared completely separate from the background or even stuck out slightly from the screen. Like looking in a little window. \n\nBut a lot of 3rd party games sucked at 3d design or didn't care. Their stuff looked like the kind of 3D you'd see on an embossed metal cookie tin where objects slightly stick out from the background.",

You just brought back memories of 2009-2013 when every fucking movie had a 3d conversion, even if not necessary. Some of them were done well but most were horrible.

Our brains just store the modelled version with an approximation of the appropriate physical depth and displays it in our \u201cmind\u2019s eye\u201d whenever we encounter another object that looks to be of the same kind.  \n\nIf we saw in 3D, we would be able to see the depth mesh of objects like in 3D design programs (like those behind the scenes in Pixar films). This is evidenced by the fact that we think some \u201c3D\u201d optical illusions that seem to track with our movement, like paper dragons, are really just a flat sheet of paper.",

I know, it\u2019s expected in Times Square but that\u2019s exactly my point, that\u2019s why locals avoid it as much as possible.\n\n-you are more likely to get pickpocketed in Times Square than just about anywhere else\n\n-it is unrepresentative of New York.  It is basically a living caricature of this City.  You\u2019re from Texas, so imagine someone building a gigantic fake wild west town full of Texas stereotypes, in your vicinity, and then literally millions of non-Texans descend on this fake town all day, every day.  They come from everywhere to marvel at something that you know is absolutely ridiculous.  That\u2019s basically what it feels like to be a New Yorker in Times Square",

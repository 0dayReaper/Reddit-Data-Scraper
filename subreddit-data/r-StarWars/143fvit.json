Han chose flight, in a literal and figurative sense. He returned to the stars not as a war hero and Resistance fighter but as a captain, pilot, and smuggler. With his friend Chewbacca, he easily fell back into the life he had known before he had ever gotten mixed up with the Skywalker clan.\n\n&gt;He convinced himself that he was unfit for marriage or fatherhood. If a Jedi Master, like Luke, and a skillful negotiator, like Leia, couldn\u2019t reach the boy, what could he, Han, be expected to do?\n\n\u2014*Skywalker: A Family at War* by Kristin Baver",

But they didn't really destroy the empire.  The empire splintered into multiple \"remnants\" lead by \"warlords\".  A lot of the details of that are being filled in by The Mandalorian.\n\nThe First Order is one such group.  They managed to almost totally evade Republic attention by going off into the unknown regions.  \n\nThe New Republic demilitarized because they were worried about looking like a new empire (among other things), and the First Order took advantage of their lack of preparedness.  And that's where the galaxy is at the beginning TFA.\n\nLeia is very uncomfortable with the Ressistances seeming apathy external threat,  but nobody listens to her:  so she leaves the New Republic to start the Ressistance and spy on potential threats.\n\nThere are a lot of details that I'm leaving out.  But I've read/watched most of the canon material pertaining to this stuff (like you, I was very curious) so I can probably answer any questions you have about it.\n\nYou can also post questions to r/Mawinstallation, which is probably a better sub for getting straight answers about this stuff.",

Star Wars has always primarily been an \"on-screen\" medium, and if it's not on-screen then it didn't happen. So, we don't know, essentially. The sequel trilogy failed to tell us, and thus failed as a story.",

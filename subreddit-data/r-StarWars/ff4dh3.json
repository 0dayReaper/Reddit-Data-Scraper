I love being able to point my helmet to one side and then watch through my peripherals at people pointing and looking over at my costume through my visor. If someone seems particularly interested, I'll look over and wave them over. It's a pretty cool benefit of wearing a helmet, and I smile for the camera every time even though they can't see it :)",

I\u2019d much prefer the actors be able to improvise and offer experiences unique to the individual and the situation, even if it sounded less than identical to what we\u2019re used to. The prerecorded lines make these interactions seem so awkward and mechanical. Fear of actors saying something out of character probably prevents this, I suppose. But for the right money I\u2019m sure they could find the right ppl.",

The CM was clearly thrown by the question and before she could answer this woman had gotten down on all fours, lifted her dress up, and crawled inside. It was such a WTF moment. Elsa was shocked. The photographer was shocked. Those of us in line were horrified and fascinated. But no one said a damn thing to her! They snapped a pic of this crazy bitch with her face peeking out from underneath the hemline of Elsa\u2019s dress and let her go on her merry way. \n\nThat was the day I realized that whatever CMs get paid, it\u2019s not enough.",

It's kind of a prisoner's dilemma thing. There's a stable equilibrium where everyone buys toilet paper just when they need it, but also an equilibrium where everyone stocks up because that's what everyone else is doing.\n\nAll it took was one person posting a photo of a single Costco being sold out. Lots of Chinese shop at Costco in Australia, and they were a bit panicky over nCov. And Costco has huuuuuuuuuge packs but not very many packs, so if a lot of people stock up in a weekend (with like 3 months supply) then it can sell out. Also, Costco just doesn't care that much about selling out of some stock - they are a bulk discount store - they only care about selling at a low price not like the major supermarkets which try to make sure customers never have to visit another shop.",

    "postText": "I was wondering while re-watching \"Revenge of the Sith\" for like the 1,000th time the other day about the \"celebrity\" status of the Jedi during this area (and others for that matter).\n\nHere's what we know:\nWe know that at this time the Jedi are seen as almost mythical like beings in the galaxy (Anakin as a young boy in Phantom Menace).\n\nWe learn that Obi-Wan Kenobi had a sibling (Kenobi TV series).\n\nWe know that they are separated from their families at a very young age, most it seems within the first year or two if I'm understanding correctly.\n\nWe know that Anakin is seen as a \"hero of the galaxy\" and is a very popular public figure.\n\nWould any family members seek out their siblings/children who have gone on to become Jedi?  For example, after Kenobi was praised for defeating Darth Maul and ranked up to a Jedi Knight would that news have spread across the galaxy?  Would his brother have come to Coruscant to seek him out?  What would have happened if Obi-Wan's sibling had shown up at the Jedi temple wanting to see him?\n\nAttachments are forbidden but would this have happened?\n\nI'm just now working my way through the books and the legends content, so if this is discussed there I do apologize.",

That was one of the reasons why when he fell and became Darth Vader that Anakin \"died\" ... I know that gets colored in more with subsequent SW content, but that's where I'm coming from on this.",

There isn\u2019t anything stopping a knight from going to visit their family in their spare time. \n\nHowever I will note that in the EU there was an issue where the definition of attachment would periodically change due to the different writers having different interpretations. Mainly between family ties being a no no to the Lucas definition of unhealthy love. So there are example like Shmi not being able to send a letter to Anakin, while we also have examples of other Jedi getting letters from their birth families without interference.",

                            "comment": "The problem is that there is a discrepancy in the EU on the definition of attachment. \n\nAttachment as defined by Lucas was unhealthy love. When you become possessive of people and love the way they make you feel rather than loving the person themselves. Lucas stated this was Anakin\u2019s fatal flaw, he would confuse love with selfish attachment. The novelization of ROTS goes into it pretty well with even Anakin himself noting that moment that saving Padme was within his grasp, he choked her out. Why? Because he was thinking of himself. Padme wasn\u2019t doing as he wanted so she was a threat.\n\nThe EU sometimes had the idea that attachment was removal of emotional ties, but even then it would also switch back to the Lucas definition such as in the case of Ben Skywalker explaining that loving someone or even being married isn\u2019t an attachment, it\u2019s instead how you react in the face of adversity to those you care about that determines if you are attached or not, with unhealthy toxic behavior being the key factor in determining the difference between love and attachment.",

The Jedi Council, including Yoda, didn\u2019t approve of Dooku maintaining such ties, but didn\u2019t outright prevent him either. I think it was a good example of how the Jedi struggled to balance competing tenets of their philosophy, where forcing someone not to do something conflicted with the order\u2019s emphasis on encouraging harmony and free will. In other words, they wanted Dooku on his own initiative to cut off contact with his family because he would believe that any attachment would cloud his judgment.",

It talks about how kids across the republic would \"play\" as them, as well as debate who would win if they fought",

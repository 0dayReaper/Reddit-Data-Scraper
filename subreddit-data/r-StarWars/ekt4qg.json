It returned in 2010 after the death of Michael Jackson and closed again in 2014. The theater was then used for some movie sneak peeks, and then *Star Wars: Path of the Jedi*\n\nCaptain Eo is still the best thing that has been shown there, and I'm still upset they removed it. \n\n*note, these are Disneyland dates",

The line from the Magic Eye Theatre stretched all the way out of Tomorrowland, down Main Street, to the Train Station and back up the street all the way to the Adventureland gate. Estimated wait time was over six hours.\n\nAs part of the special event, the park was open the entire weekend without closing. It was really cool for its time and the 3D + practical in-theatre effects were pretty mind-blowing.",

The Disney actors are very well trained.  They are taught the lore and personality of their character and know it inside and out so they know how to answer questions and deal with situations that may be put in front of them. It's all part of the magic.\n\nI remember when we were at Disney World just after our daughter had passed away.  We got to talk to the Fairy God Mother.  She was asking our oldest daughter what brought us there today, and being the four year old that our daughter was at the time, she told the truth. She told her that we were there because her sister just went to heaven and wanted to go some place happy that she would have liked. It was incredibly heart melting, cute and sad at the same time. Fairy God mother didn't even flinch and had a perfect response. She didn't seem sad at a four year old telling her this, she was extremely comforting and it was absolutely perfect.  Any other adult dressed up in a costume because they thought it would be cool could have absolutely fucked this up.",

My daughter had a stuffed bear she left in the hotel room, the staff cleaned the room and put the bear on the bed tucked in with a disney storybook beside it and a note saying they read him a book and had fun with him while we were out.  My son was a picky eater and we were at a buffet where he wasn't eating much so they came up, noticed this, and offered to make him something special, then came back with some pizza for him.  When interacting with Mickey Mouse my sons ears we bought him broke, and he was devastated, when we were leaving the staff came up to us and told him Mickey wanted him to have this and gave him a new pair of ears.\n\nThis is just a few of the things that happened to us over our vacation.  They truly go above and beyond to make every moment wonderful and magical.  It is worth the price.",

People were excited because the current dark side character was only Kylo Ren. But this kid opted out of the Darth Vader boots, so he had new balance sneakers. While guests were taking photos, he was allegedly groping the female guests and saying inappropriate things. His mom and him left after the guests came forward to cast members with the complaints, and probably changed out of his costume because when security came nobody could find him anywhere in the park. The only description of the guy was height and shoe color",

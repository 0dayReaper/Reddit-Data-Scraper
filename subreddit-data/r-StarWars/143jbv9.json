That type of game will be super cool.",

The fact that it first happens when he's dressed as an imperial while hunting (chasing is too nice, man was ready to slice and dice) a fleeing former jedi is the cherry on top. I was almost worried it wouldn't be included at all, considering his more mature and confident character development since fallen order. I'm also a sucker for media where the good guy goes bad anyway so...yeah, all around great idea with a surprising execution (detail-wise) to it as well.",

The script is a mess but it does four things TROS didnt do;\n\n1) it took risks, introduced tons of ideas that made the story interesting\n2) it actually tried to wrap the 9-movie saga up in terms of bringing balance to the force\n3) it actually gave Finn a nice role and a true semblance of an uprising against the empire/first order\n4) it continued the story written in TLJ, it didnt just walk everything back and destroy any semblance of a trilogy.\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/E02BkoY_K0I",

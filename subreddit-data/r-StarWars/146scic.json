If you shoot the ship and slow it down, you'll crash into it because you don't have enough room to avoid it. If you shoot the ship and destroy it, you'll fly straight into the explosion (which is not always a problem in Star Wars, to be fair) and whatever debris is left (a bigger issue).\n\nI can't guarantee that these are the actual reasons, when the main reason is \"the TIE fighter is only there to make things more exciting, not actually stop the Falcon\".",

All he knew is he followed an enemy ship into the Death Star and that if he opened fire in the cramped tunnels he would kill himself and his comrades on the other side of the infrastructure. All it takes is the Falcon to explode or drop debris in front of him not to mention any parts of the station itself.  So he was simply following the Falcon until it resurfaced.",

The page for [Airen Cracken](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Airen_Cracken) mentions him doing so in both tabs.",

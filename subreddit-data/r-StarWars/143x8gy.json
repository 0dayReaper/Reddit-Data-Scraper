    "postText": "There's some conversation online about how new order 66 survivors keep popping up and that is somehow a bad thing, and diminishes both the importance of Luke and the magnitude of order 66. \n\nLet's do the math. No sources though, because you have google too and if someone is going to post about star wars on reddit--they already did the googling.  \n\n\nSo we know there were about 10,000 Jedi during their peak. There are an estimated 400 quadrillion sentient beings in the SW galaxy. A quadrillion has 15 zeroes, so that's 400,000,000,000,000,000.   \n\n\nThe % of Jedi at the peak of their numbers represented 0.0000000000025% of the population.\n\nIf 200 Jedi survived that would be 0.0000000000001%.\n\nYeah I used the same denominator for both. It's a dumb star wars post--of course I didn't factor in birth/death rates or the effects on the galactic population related to the Clone and Civil Wars. \n\nIt's still such a small percentage in both cases. Know anyone with Stone Man's disease? It's a rare condition (1 in 2 million) where a person's bones turn into stone. That's 0.00000001250000% of the population. I included the trailing 0s to illustrate the difference in scale.",

            "comment": "Even 200 out of 10,000 means 98% of Jedi were killed because of Order 66, which would be amazingly effective in the grand scheme of things. And 200 survivors spread out across the galaxy means the odds of Jedi finding one another were low. Jedi surviving the purge in my mind doesn\u2019t diminish Luke\u2019s accomplishments - he brought balance to the Force by redeeming his father, and no one else could do that.",

We know of at least two who were in the Temple and got away. Beq and Grogu.\n\nHow many were in the field and managed to escape? Again, we know of at least 3.",

            "comment": "Even the Jedi that we have seen survived are barely a lot. And some I think have deaths before New Hope anyway. Pretty sure the amount of deaths from the Battle of Geonosis to Order 66 is still at least 97% of the total. The rest would have been away from the battles, like Consulars or the other order that helps with farming or something they wouldn\u2019t have really been around clones or battles and probably could have hid well enough for a time. Combined with Obi Wan\u2019s warning to not come back to Coruscant and the clones turned they would have ran away. However small amount of Jedi were there as the war would have brought most of them into it. That was probably a small amount as well maybe 10 Jedi at most doing that as the war would have taken precedent. \n\nIf the emperor never thought there would be Jedi that survived he wouldn\u2019t have allowed the creation of the inquisitors. Who also did their jobs.",

            "comment": "Some fun math I did last night when thinking about one of the earlier posts on this: \n\nThe republic has 1.3 million planets in it.  Let's assume that the majority have extremely low populations such that the average population of each planet is just 1 million.\n\nIf each Jedi met one person every day, what are the odds that a citizen of the Republic would meet a Jedi? \n\nWell, the odds of being the person met on Any given day would be: \n\n  P=10,000/(1,300,00*1,000,000) = 0.000000077% \n\nThe odds that you meet them at least once is 1 minus the odds of never meeting them, which itself is equal to 1 minus the odds of success raised to the number of attempts. So we get: \n\nP(meeting)= 1- (1-p(success))^(365*100) \n\n*Above assumes Jedi lives to be around 100*\n\nThose odds? \n\n1-(1-0.0000000077)^(36,500)= 0.00028   (0.028%)\n\n\nFor reference, that's low enough odds that in a scientific study it would mean there is a 3 sigma chance that the Jedi are just a statistical fluke and not actually real. \n\nIf each of the 10,000 Jedi lived to be 10,000 years old and met one person a day, you would still only have a 25% chance of meeting one.  (Amusingly, this is the same as if the Jedi live to be 100 and met 10,000 people every day)\n\nBy a fun coincidence, 1.3million planets at one million people each comes out to be 1.3 trillion.  \n\n*That's how many people live on Corescant alone*",

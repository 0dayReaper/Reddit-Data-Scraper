Many would be far more confused than just Palpatine following through on his temptations to Anakin in RotS. He's also far older than Palpatine and gone through a lot in the mmo as it is, and isn't even Vitiate anymore. Unless we're just retconning his whole Legends story and making up a new Sith Lord named Vitiate in RoS so instead of little to no foreshadowing, we're just completely in the dark.",

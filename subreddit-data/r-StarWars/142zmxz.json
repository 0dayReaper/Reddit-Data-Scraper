Also there isn't many force weilders alive at this point due to order 66 and the fall of the empire\n\nbarris offee was likely executed during order 66 along with any other Jedi prisoners from ones that fell and were captured. My thought for this is that the clones were gonna execute maul and ahsoka during order 66 and neither were Jedi (captured ex sith and a citizen who can wield the force).  \n\nAnd for the record no I don't want it to be Ezra but it's pointing to be that way as the theory of it being 8th brother doesn't make sense due to him falling hella far on malachor and losing his saber and ship. Oh and there's of course the temple collapsing as Vader left which likely would have crushed him",

I'm with it. \n\nIs it too much to hope for a Prince Xizor appearance? (apologies if he's been mentioned in the new Canon, I'm relatively in the know, but not completely).\n\nAs someone who ADORES Star Wars and has for their entire life, I've had lots of mixed feelings on Disney, but I'm really pulling for this to be the kind of Star Wars EU stuff we wanted and loved from the Legends Canon.\n",

I have a picture of Boba Fett with it flipped down that's signed by Jerermy Bulloch.  He wore Boba Fett's armor in the original trilogy and also played Lieutenant Sheckil in ESB.  I have had an extreme fascination with his armor every since I my uncle gave me one of the early action figures of him when I was four.  \n\nEdit: I see /u/Ohilevoe mentioned it's a rangefinder attachment as well. \n\nEdit 2:  [Here's a link to the picture on my wall.](https://imgur.com/a/ypihnXf)",

Even if you have convergent evolution causing morphological similarities in life in that galaxy far, far away, those life forms would not be the same. They would not fit into the same phylogenetic classifications. Mammals and birds are clades that do not just refer to what they look like or what they do but also refer to genomes. It is effectively impossible for those creatures in Star Wars to have evolved identically to our own. That said, the terms used in Star Wars, like bird, monkey, and lizard, are approximations to familiar concepts. They are, however, intrinsically different.",

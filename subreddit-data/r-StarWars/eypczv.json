The Prequels, for all their flaws, are fantastic at presenting an expanded Star Wars universe with lived in planets that are memorable. \n\nHe just can\u2019t stick the dialogue or the gritty bits of plot. \n\nWorst part of the sequels for me is how little they *feel* like Star Wars connected media, no matter how much fan service they throw in. Even The Mandalorian feels like Star Wars, so it\u2019s not down to Lucas not directly being involved (even though Lucas helped Filoni get acquainted with SW world building for Clone Wars). \n\nThey just feel like Hollywood films to me.",

The Wookiees were nearly two million years old as a species. 160,000 years prior, spaceflight was a thing, and what became humans drove another species (what became the Mandalorians) off of Coruscant. \n\nI struggle to believe that the Jedi would have used paper to make their ancient texts with that context. \n\nI know it\u2019s all scrapped now, but it\u2019s definitely a retcon.",

It's fair that there are seemingly no examples of leisurely/creative writing/reading within the core star wars films and probably much of the extended universe.\n\nBut this theory does seem to gloss over the fact that there is a universal language, basic, that also has a universal alphabet, aurabesh.\nAnd aurabesh is seen all over the films in various forms. Largely it is used as signage on military equipment, or through viewfinder on binoculars.\n\nBut when we see Coruscant we also see a lot of aurabesh based advertising. And while holograms are used in advertising it's not exclusively used, nor are pictograms. For anyone to bother advertising with the written word we would have to assume a worthwhile market of literate customers exists who can read those advertisements.\n\nThere is however significantly less advertising or visible aurabesh, excluding military use, on the poorer planets like Tatooine. We could assume then that literacy rates on these planets are significantly lower than on the more metropolitan planets. And on the other, richer, planets that seem to have minimal writing (like Naboo and Cloud City) it is perhaps just not culturally appropriate to slap text and adverts onto their obviously decorative buildings.",

            "comment": "This is a fun, silly scene. It shouldn't be there.\n\nIt takes place in the middle of the Hoth evacuation. It is supposed to be a tense sequence - starting from \"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four\" pretty much all the way to when Luke gets to his X-Wing (or when the Millennium Falcon takes off). This whole chunk of the film is a carefully-paced, action sequence, which builds up tension (with a couple of outlets), puts the main characters under quite a bit of pressure, has quite a bit of death (of good guys as well), and has a fairly sombre outcome (the good guys lose; sure, many of them escape and survive, but their base is destroyed and a lot of them die). It's not the kind of sequence you want to throw jokes into.\n\nThere is some humour in there (as there is throughout the OT), but it mainly comes from the characters being themselves; particularly Han Solo making one-liners and quips at people - but that's what he does, and fits with his character (the more serious he gets, the more he tries to deflect with insults etc. - Leia does the same). And for this part of the time, it all happens while furthering the plot in some way. The one exception is C-3PO being dragged through the door after it shuts in front of him - and personally I find that shot a little jarring and out of place.\n\nThis shot (the wampas and Snowtroopers) requires three bits in the film to make it work; something to establish the Rebels have captured Wampas or have a problem with Wampas getting into parts of the base (iirc this was in the script at some point, not sure if it was ever filmed). Second, we need the set-up of C-3PO removing the sign during the high-stakes race to the Falcon. Third, we need the pay-off when the Snowtroopers, chasing the Rebels, open the door. That's three decently-long shots or bits of script dedicated to a joke, which aren't furthering the plot.\n\nFinally, this sequence involves C-3PO acting out of character. Why would he remove the sign? That would go against protocol, surely? Why does he stop when in danger of being left behind? We don't even care about the Snowtroopers being mauled by wampas; maybe if it slowed them down for a bit longer and that had a clearer pay-off later it might work, or if someone other than C-3PO had removed the sign (showing sneakiness and cunning - not traits 3PO is known for). But as it is, it doesn't quite fit.\n\nSo for that scene to be included, we have to break the drama, add in 2-3 extra shots with no plot reason, have to pull someone out of character, all for a single joke where the punch line is some random Snowtroopers getting attacked by a wampa arm.\n\nI'm glad someone said no to that scene. I wish there was someone like that working on the Prequels and Sequels to say no to some of the random jokes.",

I think it's a really funny scene (and I'm not sure you need all three--I think you could drop the first part since the warning sign in itself establishes that there's something dangerous in there and you don't need to establish what exactly it is for the joke to land IMO) but it would throw off the pacing and deflate the tension.\n\nIt's funny that so many say they want it in the movie--this is an example of the exact kind thing I'm worried about in terms of the Marvel-ification of Star Wars.",

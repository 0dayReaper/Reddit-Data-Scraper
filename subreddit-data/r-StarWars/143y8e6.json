    "postText": "I think the next Star wars game should be a story game similar to Jedi fallen order except there is co-op and single player. I think instead of it being trying to restore the order it should be you going around the galaxy freely similar to no man\u2019s sky but your actions determine what side of the force your on, similar to a karma system in fallout. you can explore all you like but there is a story line and you can meet and recruit people for your own order and your actions affect them like in the walking dead. i think space battle combat and showing the true powers of the force towards the end would be amazing and having PVP and sword fighting mechanics similar to the ones in kingdom come deliverance. It would be an RPG with customizations and the only in game purchases are skins and no pay to win mechanics. And you as the main character are a force user but you can use blasters, lightsabers, jet packs, even just the force ur fists. lots of customization and free roam like in skyrim. in short, a RPG story star wars game with many of the best mechanics from other games, let me know if that sounds cool. and im aware this was a dumb rant lmao",

I know nothing about the books or extended universe so forgive my ignorance.\n\nIf the Empire actually succeed in conquering everything, what were their post war plans. Was it just a galaxy of miserable colonies or was there something more to their end goal?",

And with the entire galaxy under his control then he\u2019d have nothing to prevent him from his true goals of studying the dark side, finding secrets to immortality and such.",

The galactic empire was a transitory construct until he could just rule as a sith emperor  instead of having to play pretend.",

To bend the galaxy to his own will and ensure that followers of his ideology stay at the top of the pyramid, or better yet, find a way of extending his life to unnatural lengths and stay there himself.\n\nThis isn't about order or peace or improving the galactic civilisations, he just wants everyone and exist in his shadow.",

            "comment": "After achievement absolute rule I don't think there was a real end goal, at least not for Palpatine. That's the thing about total conquest, almost nobody has a plan for what to do after they win. Palpatine had the end goal of becoming an immortal God king, after that Inguess he just sits around enjoying his power or looks for something else to conquer. The problem with a goal oriented mindset like Palpatine's is that at some point it becomes impossible to be satisfied because all they ever did was work towards a goal so that's all they know. If he achieved total universal domination, Palpatine would likely turn hisneyes towards a different conquest while the rest of the Empire stagnates. It's like the Daleks in Doctor Who, after they achieve total genocide and racial superiority they would have no idea what to do with themselves after because their entire existence has been in the pursuit of that one goal.",

He was so deep into the Dark Side corruption he wouldn't have ever been satisfied.\n\nNow all his Empire subordinates would probably continue to subjugate as many people as possible and gather wealth and power until they were satisfied.

There are worlds and galaxies beyond the hyperspace maps. Sith Lords like Vitiate and Nihilus didn\u2019t pay much attention to what was going on around them, they were focusing their energies to see beyond the known worlds. After conquering the known galaxy, Palpatine could focus his energy on what lies beyond.\n\nSecond: A key tenant of the light side of the force is to preserve, meaning the opposite is true of the dark side\u2026 to consume. A sith will continue to consume and increase their power until killed, typically by their apprentice.",

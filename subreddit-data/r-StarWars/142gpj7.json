Klingon disruptors like on the wing mounts of Birds of Prey would fire bolts as well.

Was always a cool effect to see.",

Not being a Seth fan really, it's by far my favorite thing he's worked on.\n\nIt is also probably the single most overrated show discussed on Reddit.  \n\nThe scripts generally feel like they were lifted wholesale from the \"If we had 10 more episodes\" pile in Gene Rodenberry's office circa 1993 (which in some cases I think they pretty much were).  The VFX are pretty good, especially the Hulu season, but set design, costume, and prosthetic work range from serviceable to pretty rough. Then, some of the performances are straight-up amateurish, like painfully bad in a way that even TOS was not.  \n\nThrough it all though, it's got heart, the lighter tone sometimes feels nicely grounded, plus that kind of show has generally lain fallow for long enough that it feels fresh, and you can just see what a love letter it is from Seth to 90s Trek.  The whole is more than the sum of its parts, but I think there's a lot of nostalgia goggles and dislike of some of the Paramount+ \"NuTrek\" that leads to it getting more praise than it deserves.\n\nAnd while I'm grousing, I do find it very interesting that the crew of the Orville is fixated on North American pop culture from ca1980 to 2000.  It's almost like Seth MacFarlane's formative years were the single most important cultural milestones in all of human history.  Hmm.  :-)",

It's almost like Seth MacFarlane's formative years were the single most important cultural milestones in all of human history.  Hmm.  :-)\n\nI always thought that was kind of an in joke for how Star Trek did pretty much the same thing. Maybe not the hyper fixation on the 80s and 90s in particular, but just Western media in general from \"our\" past, and never anything that was more \"modern\" for Trek.\n\nI think you pretty much hit the nail on the head with the rest, though.",

I just don't feel connected to the bridge crew, and while I appreciate the romances involved I don't need entire episodes dedicated to Stamets and Culper or Burnham and what's his face with the cat.\n\nPicard S1 and S2 sucked. S3 was amazing though in my opinion.\n\nSNW is fucking amazing. It goes back to the style where each episode is a new plot, the season isn't dedicated to one overreaching dilemma. The actors and crew are great, the Enterprise looks great, Pike is great. It's just awesome, definitely give it a watch. Especially since Season 2 starts on June 15th.",

Unless the rebels had some sort of carrier to hold an entire squadron of these, I don't see them being used a lot as most rebel tactics were simply hit and run where massive space battles seen above Scariff and Endor are just quite rare in general. No hyperdrive means the pilots can't flee directly after combat and have to resort to other means.\n\nPlus, the only feature of the prototype was the ridiculously OP laser beam, and no other armaments. A squadron can maybe take out a star destroyer or two, but that's pretty much it. Newer designs featured heavier guns and torpedo launchers that can deal damage at critical structures with precision on multiple capital ships, which was their intended design as an anti-capital ship starfighter. No use firing a weapon only to be left defenseless after using your only weapon.",

The B-Wing didn't appear until RotJ, and considering it's weird look it was probably a recent idea of sticking as many guns onto a ship as they could, the Rebel shipyards slapped those things together ASAP for the battle. Does it fly? Does it shoot? Does it work (most of the time)? Good enough.",

FFS, they could've just used the Z-95 Headhunters as the \"other\" fighter to go with the recovered Y-Wings before the X-Wings were started to be introduced at the end of Rebels.",

The First Order ship already starts to chain reaction after only a few bombs had even hit, if it only took a few to do so then a lot of smaller ships can coordinate and hit different points. Some can tackle the bridge, sensor arrays, the bigass weak spot. If three or four Y-Wings can disable a regular Star Destroyer, I'm confident an entire squadron of them (plus B and X Wings) can take out the slower ship with it's anti starfighter turrets knocked out by Poe and a massive Resident Evil-style \"shoot me here\" spot right on it's surface. That ship was just asking to be destroyed.",

They deflected starfighter-grade cannons with lightsabers on the regular when they are significantly more powerful than handheld blasters. Orbital bombardment from Star Destroyers landing shots like 5 feet away from the main characters and somehow they aren't vaporized. Punching a Stormtrooper in the face with bare fists somehow knocks them out for as long as the plot needed. The power levels are just all over the place with that show.",

But making him a son of Lando would have made sense because then it would have tied him to Han especially and to Leia because they would have been old friends of his father. \n\nFinn even looked like he could be Lando's son. Or making Finn a long lost Windu too would have made sense especially if he were to be Mace's son or grandson which would have been believable. Finn even looks like the actor Samuel L Jackson.",

So that the theme that was lost during the ST that you don\u2019t need to be related to force uses to become a powerful Jedi could had been kept in some form.  Also Finn should have had a different role in TLJ, and onwards.  They set him up in the trailers in TFA to have a main role and he just ends up being a very minor side character.",

The Sequels weren't terrible but you can't deny that if they just spawned another death star like they did everyone would be like.\n    \"omg the first movie was so pointless they can't just magic up a new death star cause someone the death star returned its so stupid boo L movie\" \nEveryone would've done that to just shit on the sequels",

It wasn\u2019t built up to a lot, but it\u2019s not unreasonable for the Empire to try to build another super weapon with the vast resources they had, this time learning from their previous mistakes and now viewing the rebellion as a bigger threat.",

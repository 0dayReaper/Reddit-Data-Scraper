Im definitely jumping on the Galen Marek hype train (because I love The Force Unleashed games) but I think it would be cool thematically to have two people trained by the same master after that master is gone fight against each other. So yes, I hope its him, but we will just have to wait and see!",

Galen's way too strong for Sidious to leave him alone. Inquisitors are meant to be scrubs hunting down Padawans while leaving anything stronger to Vader.",

Just enjoy the stuff done with him in legends. To fit him into canon would mean changing him to such an extent that he is basically an unrecognisable character with the same name. It\u2019s pointless. Just look at it from a practical standpoint as well. This series already has Thrawn, the nightsister, Baylan and his apprentice. That\u2019s on top of Sabine, Hera and Ezra being introduced to those who didn\u2019t watch Rebels.",

I think a film/series following an unredeemed knight could be interesting because they could provide an interesting take. He/she would be unredeemed but would not be strong enough to assume the mantle of the next major villain or find a powerful master (with kylo and Sidious both dead\n\nso what do they do with themselves\u2026..what is their  purpose in this galaxy without someone to serve and without the strength to take power for themselves?\n\ncould be a good little story in there",

I think if you got a good actor like Robert Pattinson or Matt smith you could give them a nice little arc of an ego that far outweighs their actual skill/talents\u2026..you could still bring in the idea they were Luke\u2019s students or at least this one is \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey feel they\u2019ve been passed over constantly in favour of kylo by both teachers",

They\u2019re a brotherhood and Order with strict honour code of conduct (akin to real life medieval knights) that is ruthless but fair **in their eyes**.\n\nThey don\u2019t seek power or to manipulate like the Sith but follow an almost \u201cfate will find my path/chaos reigns\u201d mantra where they trust in the Dark Side to take them where they need to go.\n\nPre-OT the Knights are a small but long standing Order who have slowly fallen into decline as their connection to the Dark Side wanes, and \u201cFate\u201d it seems has abandoned them.\n\nDuring the Rise of the Empire, Palpatine tries to crush any all remaining Force Users who could threaten him, and so the remaining Knights we see by the time of the comics in the OT and the movies of the ST are basically the dregs. A rather sad group of edgelords trying to reclaim lost glory rather than the dedicated warriors they used to be.",

Yeah that would be the idea.\n\nI pitched an possible \u201cEpisode 10\u201d idea months and months ago on here about how we don\u2019t actually see Ben kill *all* the Knights on Exegol.\n\nSo basically some of the surviving Sith Cultists hide from the fleet and destruction on the surface by going deep into catacombs beneath, which are full of Dark Side energies (think the forest on Dagobagh) and artefacts they worship/Palpatine wanted kept safe.\n\nWhen they emerge days after the battle they find one of the Knights barely clinging to life. So they take him and retreat back beneath the surface. The cultists want to restore the Sith\u2026.except they\u2019re all dead now with Palpatine, no one has Sith training\u2026.except the surviving Knight is the closest thing they have.\n\nSo they nurse him back to health and try to teach him everything they know, all the knowledge they gathered, and all the artefacts they have.\n\nThe Knight trains for over a year or so in the dark depths, gradually becoming more powerful. In flashbacks during his training we see that he was a recruit who joined the Knights only shortly before Ben took over the group. Because of that he and Ben especially formed a bond of brotherhood within the Knights, and feeling his force potential Ben personally started teaching this particular Knight elements of his Jedi/Dark Side training from Luke &amp; Snoke respectively.\n\nBens turn on the Knights on Exegol was a personal betrayal and deep hurt to his almost apprentice who viewed them as brothers, but who Ben cast down without blinking and left for dead.\n\nSo the Knight has a deep personal grudge against Ben despite his later death. After completing his training the Knight declares himself to be taught \u201call you know\u201d and leaves the Cultists who are dismayed as they wanted him to lead them. The Knight states that he is not the latest of the Banite Sith (Rule of Two) but something else, something new. \n\nHe takes the training and knowledge of what the Knights once were, what they could be again, combined with his Jedi/Sith training and knowledge and becomes the first of the new Sith Order.\n\nHe arises as Darth Nemo, First Knight of Ren, and first in the Renite Sith Order.\n\nUntil he hears word that a Jedi, Rey Skywalker has given birth to twins\u2026\u2026twins who\u2019s force presence feels very familiar to a \u201cbrother\u201d he once knew.",

And I thought what about something similar but for the Dark Side.\n\nSo Darth Nemo isn\u2019t planning huge wars or trying to build the Empire 3.0. Instead he\u2019s travelling the Galaxy \u201con the will of the Dark Side\u201d, living according to his honour code. \n\nHe is a roaming Knight of old. He kills those he feels should die, spares or protects for his own reasons (there is no glory in senseless death, there is an advantage to gaining favour with this group etc) and all the while seeks only his further understanding and development of the Dark Side of the Force.\n\nHe slowly recruits others and rebuilds the Sith Order as a pyramid. Not a Duo.\n\nWith a Council of 12 made up of the first tier of High Sith (3 top positions), then the lower Sith Lords (4 middling positions), and finally the Sith Knights (5 Apprentice/Journeyman Sith who must survive on their own and walk The Path to eventually rise through the ranks).\n\nBut Darth Nemo\u2019s main personal vendetta is against the children of Ben Solo.",

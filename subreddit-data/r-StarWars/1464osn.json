    "postText": "I think  a show about Darth Maul would be really cool. I know most of his story was explained in Clone Wars and Rebels but they could do the show with a recap or a few episodes showing Maul getting his new legs and maybe filling any plot holes and then make the rest of the show Maul and Savage Opress   finding Obi Wan or make a new enemy for Maul. They teased him at the end of solo and so far have done nothing with that. I think it would be a good way to bring back Darth Maul, A fan favourite character.",

            "comment": "I'd rather pre-TPM maul. I want to see Maul as he was before he fell, to juxtapose what he becomes after and see what he was \"robbed of\" in his mind. I want to see the heir of the sith legacy and how things were \"planned\" to go until TPMs events changed things up. This'll naturally let us expand on pre-TPM sith lore as well. \n\nWe already have so much material set in Clone Wars era maul, if we had to do post-TPM maul i'd want something that bridges TCW to Rebels since we only really know a little about what he was doing around 10 BBY",

Shadow Hunter and Lockdown are both fun side missions that Sidious sends him on as they tie into pre-Blockade plans. Such as hunting down one of the trade federation members who was trying to sell info on the blockade before it happened. I\u2019d love to see them explore this era of Maul more.",

If disney made it good it could be the thing to restart their shows but if it fails it would be a huge hit against them so it would be a big risk.",

There is a Crimson Dawn comic run but I dont think Maul is featured but we know Qira goes to him to train so maybe that could be a cool 2-3 episode arc of Tales, to tease him like that and never pay it off was lame as fuck",

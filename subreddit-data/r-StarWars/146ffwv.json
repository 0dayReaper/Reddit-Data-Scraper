    "postText": "I don't mind episode 7 and 9. They are JJ style films. Story gets convoluted but that's because 8 destroyed a lot of it. But the ending scene where Ben rescues Rey.  It would have been awesome for a couple scenarios to happen rather than Ben dying. They talk about \"essence transfer\" but there is no way a normal being can do it. Has to be a force user.  Would have been cool if either Rey died and Ben came back to give her the last bit of essence transfer she gave him to keep her alive which makes her not really a force user anymore.   Or it would have been cool if both were diminished old hags and the next series of movies came about by a TOTALLY different threat outside the galaxy and the 2 people who are supposed to be the most powerful can't do anything about it because they wasted their \"midichlorians\" to save the galaxy. So a new story line arises. But we get to keep a couple of the characters in the timeline. And we get to hear about Finn's force sensitivity which JJ clearly implied in 7 and 9 and was disregarded.

I was trying to say, rey gave up her life as a jedi which would be thematic with luke (i dont agree with anything they did with luke) to keep ben alive. Or it would have made sense to move from the skywalker storyline where both of them have used up all their force \"essence\" because thats what they do. they care about others. and they turn into old hermits during the next generation of films. they don't have to die for the next thing to happen.",

Heck most of the issues she has is because Kylo exists.  \n\nKylo is the one with emotional issues, and has reason to reconstruct the Jedi order since he\u2019s the very reason why it failed.\n\nHe\u2019s done so much bad that him spending the rest of his life to attempt to fix what he\u2019s done is a huge   Character building and compelling reason to push forward.\n\nHim trying to rebuild the order when some people still remember what he has done would add conflict.",

            "comment": "JJ Abrams set the series up for failure (Luke's Order already having failed, New Republic already getting destroyed, a \"resistance\" already needing to exist), and then when he has a chance to \"Fix\" it in Ep 9, he chose to give the timeline about 2 weeks from Ep 8 and made all the nonsense decisions that came about in Ep 9 (the \"thousand-years old knife that somehow aligns perfectly with the death star wreckage? And how the throne room somehow survived? \n\nThe mental hoops the Abrams apologists go through, I swear lol. Abrams flat-out made Finn's storyline irrelevant with the introduction of the faction that had already been rebelling from the First Order lmao, like his whole \"first order trooper who led a rebellion of other troopers\" shtick was taken from him BY Abrams, what are you even talking about \"which JJ Clearly implied in 7 and 9\" when Abrams is the one who disregarded it?",

I liked that premise. Wild Wild West. Rhian wrote in a new faction that was stronger than the other. Both were wiped out as what is said in episode 9 when they say starkiller base failed. 8 is a shit show.",

Why were rose and Holdo, added?  Holdo manuver working is one of the worst ideas introduced (but it\u2019s okay since it looks cool /s).  Killing off Luke (both character wise and literally) because otherwise she\u2019d greatly over shadow Rey, and to create some reason for why he\u2019s been gone for so long.\n\nHell even Rey isn\u2019t the same person which is hard to tell since she\u2019s such a blank slate.  But she attacks Luke(even though he was a jerk) the Rey from episode 7 wouldn\u2019t have done that.  I mean think about it who\u2019s worse Luke or Kylo the guy who literally tortured her.",

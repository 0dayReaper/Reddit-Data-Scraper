In fact, most go way beyond what Stanislavski originally intended. Cushing, McDiarmid, and Lee come from a different era and largely had a different approach to acting. It's not that one way is always better than the other. But I think many actors try too hard sometimes. To quote Lawrence Olivier, when Dustin Hoffman was being \"too method\" on set, \u201cMy dear boy, why don't you just try acting?\u201d.",

I was supposed to be exhausted from running away from him for three days, so I said I\u2019d stayed up all night for a couple of days, and I winked at him. I was kidding. It was the days of Studio 54, and it was my way of saying I\u2019d partied all weekend. We laughed about it.

Probably just ordered or pulled a lot of those style boots from the props/ uniform store and people picked the size that fit and if you not a standard size then oh well.\n\nEasiest way to do it is just let him wear slippers and keep the camera above his feet",

So he started insisting on taking a mint before every take, just in hopes that maybe he wouldn't offend Carrie with his breath. Meanwhile Carrie Fisher it turned out really loved and admired Peter, and was struggling to deliver such venomous lines to someone she considered such a sweetheart. \n\nSo put that together, and you had an escalating dynamic of gentlemanliness, where every time Carrie'd deliver that line, she'd struggle to get it out, and then Peter would take another mint because he thinks it might be his breath that's causing Carrie to miss the take, causing Carrie to struggle even harder to get the line out, etc. As I understood it, they had to talk it out to resolve the dilemma and do the scenes.",

So when Carrie Fisher becomes upset she becomes British by tapping into her year and a half of going to a British school for central speech and drama as a teenager.  ](https://youtu.be/XBsEuUZcosw) You can see the video of Carrie Fisher, Daisy Ridley, and John Boyega on the Graham Norton Show.",

            "comment": "Man, the entire chain of command and deference in the Empire in ANH was really interesting.\n\nTarkin was clearly top dog. Even Vader deferred to him. Then you had Motti, Tagge, and Yularen around the Death Star conference room, bickering (\"pointlessly\") about whether and how to use the Death Star. Motti's so full of confidence he even insults Lord Vader, although he comes to regret it as Vader chokes him. (And then at a single command from Tarkin, Vader releases him.)\n\nLeia insults Vader by describing him as Tarkin's attack dog - although he is pretty accurately described as such.\n\nMy own head-canon is that these officers were the folks who helped put Palpatine into power. They were the initial heroes of the New Order, born in the fires of struggle and the early supporters. Although they were fractious, they nevertheless respected each other and came up in the revolution together. Even Vader, mechanical and sinister, viewed Tarkin with deference and at least as an equal within the military hierarchy.\n\nThen of course the DS-01 is destroyed and Vader is the only survivor.\n\nNote his drastic change of behavior in ESB. Now that his peer group of fellow early revolutionaries is gone, he's lost all fear or boundaries to his behavior. He's constantly insulting, gibing, and taunting his military subordinates - when he's not outright executing them. It's almost as though Vader lost more than just a close group of colleagues on the DS-01, he lost his entire moral gyroscope as well. Now he's surrounded by military personnel whom he doesn't care about and perhaps doesn't even consider human. Certainly, there's nobody among them who could restrain him the way Tarkin did.\n\nIt's like once the prior generation of leaders died off, there's nobody left to control or moderate Vader's anger and rage and frustration. Left unchecked, he mows through the military top ranks so that serving with him is a dangerous proposal.",

            "comment": "As  childhood member of the Peter Cushing fan club, I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Mr. Cushing in 1975 in New York City. I was 13 years old and filled my misspent youth watching horror films at my local cinema, specifically Hammer films. I was thrilled and entranced with Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee's performances.  My sister and I brought an actual blanket into the cinema while watching a double feature of Horror of Dracula/Curse of Frankenstein. When a scary moment appeared on the screen, we'd scream and pull the blanket over our heads!\n     Thank you Mr. Cushing, for all those wonderful\nThrills and chills and for allaying a 13 year old boy's fears of meeting you with a warm smile and disarming greeting. You are truly a legend to me. I'm so glad that your portrayal as Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars will forever cement your legacy in our popular culture as your portrayals of Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein have done so in my heart.",

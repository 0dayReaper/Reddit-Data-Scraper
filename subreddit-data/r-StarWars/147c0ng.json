    "postText": "My 10-year-old son asked me to watch Star Wars in timeline order and we watched all of it except the animated series. He didn't want to watch any of the animated series. Is there anything important we missed? Also I've been missing out all my years. I'm 41 and I had only seen the first 7 episode movies plus rogue One.\n\nThe Mandalorian was really good and I'm looking forward to a fourth season.\n\nThe new trilogy was kind of underwhelming. At least there's plenty of time and stories to mine in between episode 6 and 7.\n\nCurious where they take it with episode 10.",

Was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one when they were all far more likeable in their own show.\n\nI get what they were going for with them initially but toning the attitude down and having Crosshair keep the standoffish nature worked much better for me. They still know damn well how skilled they are but only Crosshair is a dick about it and that fits his character. One Crosshair is great, a whole team of him is too much.",

The clones will always get me. And my husband made me a full sized Rex helmet and two DC-17s for Christmas last year. He's never seen a single episode. Fives is next. Then Echo. He knows what he has done.\n\nHe'll joke that when he was little he dreamed for a wife who likes Star Wars, now he wants to send me back. Totally blame TCW and Rebels.

They are living, feeling, human beings. They are child soldiers. (Consider that most are *ten* years old when sent into combat.) They are slaves. And the Republic uses them as cannon-fodder. The  *Jedi* use them as cannon fodder. And we're meant to wonder how the Jedi were blind to Palpatine when they were blind to their own evil? The Republic has fallen before the series even starts, and slowly, slowly, you get to see it. It's freaking brilliant. \n\nAnd the clones as individuals are perfect and heartbreaking and just...Rex and Cody and Fives and Echo and Hevy and Waxer and Boil and Hardcase and...all of them...\n\nThen we have Ahsoka and all she represents - a pure, light-side Jedi. What a Jedi is supposed to be. And how that comes under attack.\n\nAnd then Anakin and how his fall becomes an inevitable tragedy instead of some weird, emo flipped switch. And a real, tender passion with Padme that makes sense And seven seasons of his brotherhood with Obi-Wan that lends a chest-kick to everything in the Kenobi series.\n\nAnd Hondo. And Cad Bane. And Ventriss. \n\n... ... ...just skip everything with Jar Jar. \ud83d\ude11",

I\u2019m grateful that the franchise exists in as many mediums as it does, but if only the animated content existed, I\u2019d still think it was a great franchise. It\u2019s a world unto itself, that expands Star Wars with some of its almost imaginative storytelling. \n\nAnd it\u2019s much more substantive and dramatic than people tend to assume.

However, both shows pick up a lot of steam. For me, the last four episodes of CW S7 are some of the best stuff we've gotten- it feels like a really good movie.\n\nBoth shows also have a lot of \"filler\" episodes (cue the downvotes). Some people don't want to admit it, but there are a lot of bad episodes here and there, most of which don't advance the plot at all. If you don't have the patience for that, there are guides on the interwebs that tell you which episodes and story arcs are must watch, and which ones can be skipped.\n\nStay away from Resistance, which is for the kiddies, and even the kiddies don't care for it.\n\nEdit: I forgot the Bad Batch. Similar to CW and Rebels, there are some episodes that are outstanding and others that are boring \"fillers\". I personally can't stand the young girl clone character, Omega, but she doesn't ruin the whole thing. Some episodes feel like a bit of a waste, but overall it's decent. It bridges the gap between Order 66 quite well and goes deep into the abandonment of the clones in favor of conscripted stormtroopers.",

            "comment": "It's not OBLIGATORY to watch the animated series but I do highly recommend them. In the case of both The Clone Wars and Rebels they start out very juvenile and child-oriented (which isn't to say they're bad, just simplistic) but both become much more mature and really come into their own as foundational works in the new canon by their respective ends. The Clone Wars especially helps fill in the awkward gaps in Anakin's character between Episode II and III, while Rebels is very much the spiritual \"first installment\" in Jon Favreau's \"Mando-verse\" series (The Mandalorian, the Book of Boba Fett, and soon Ahsoka).\n\nResistance is something of a mixed bag. It's enjoyable but can be a bit chaotic tonally. It also was apparently rushed to its finale by Lucasfilm and Disney executives and so never has an opportunity to mature with its audience like TCW and Rebels do. As a result, it's the weakest of the three \"main\" animated series, and really only worth a watch if you're a fan of the Sequels in particular. (That said it does have one of my favorite starship designs across all of sci-fi and a great cast of characters)\n\nThe Bad Batch is probably the least worth watching. Not because it's bad but the nature of its premise means it mostly appeals to fans of The Clone Wars in particular. It's not required reading for a casual fan.\n\nI understand your son my have some hesitation to watch the animated ones, especially if he's at the age where he's beginning to outgrow cartoons, but I would definitely encourage you to encourage him to give them a shot. TCW is the best one to start with, both because it is the best one (in my opinion) but also because, being the first, all of the other canon animated shows use it as a springboard for much of their own narratives. You can find an official watch order online (it was initially pitched and developed as an anthology series with unrelated episodes and story arcs but over time became much more episodic, so much of the first two seasons were developed and aired out of order. For example, the TV movie, which came out a few months before the premiere of the series, is chronologically the third \"episode\" of the series)",

At least there's plenty of time and stories to mine in between episode 6 and 7.\n\nPersonally, I hope they are done with making films for the main episodic series. The whole Skywalker/Solo saga just needs to be allowed to rest. Should've been after Episode VI, IMO. The Empire had been largely defeated, the New Republic put in place, and that was that.\n\nI personally didn't get or see the reason to &gt;!just suddenly \"restore\" the Empire as the First Order who somehow managed to become uber-strong again and just resurrect Palpatine through Sith magic, just so they could drag out the story longer for three more films. It just felt desperate.!&lt;\n\nInstead, the focus should be largely on filling in gaps between/before/around the original six episodes. \"Star Wars Stories\" films like Solo and Rogue One, focusing on each character more, as one example; those were INCREDIBLE films. Kenobi, and The Mandalorian, and BOBF are some other EXCELLENT examples of what they can really make shine for the entire Star Wars franchise. The Clone Wars series really shed some amazing light on the Clone Wars era.\n\nThat's the stuff where Disney/Lucasfilm needs to concentrate its efforts in making this IP expand.",

Do more \"filling in the gaps\" series and films, focusing on individual character backgrounds, maybe even a series on Luke's time on Tatooine and his adventures growing up as a kid. They alluded to this a little bit in Kenobi, but it'd be neat to expand on it more, with all the criminal elements on Tatooine, the Tuskan Raiders, etc. there's plenty of adventures a moisture farm boy could have there.",

People complain about the CGI quality which is very of the time, but it did allow for more fantastical and alien environments that make the galaxy look a lot richer than the OT and subsequently ST that mostly happen on sparsely populated mono-Earth biome planets. When I watch things in episode order, it feels like the galaxy gets blander and more confined as you go. \n\n I also think a lot of the significance of what happens in the prequels really only hits when you've seen the OT first. Obviously, you can still follow the plot watching it chronologically. It's just the OT is distilled down to what is essential for a pretty straightforward conflict, whereas the conflicts in the prequels are more complex and meant to answer how they went from a democratic Republic to a totalitarian Empire.",

You also get a lot of good stuff with the clones, you meet new characters that show up in live action later (like Saw Gerrera and Bo-Katan Kryze, among others). Most importantly imo, you meet Ahsoka and get to see her grow into a Jedi.\n\nRebels is shorter, and imo doesn't really get rolling until the second season, but there's some stuff that will provide important context for the upcoming Ahsoka series, and the character arcs are just really good in most cases. \n\nPersonally, I think Rebels is on average a better show than Clone Wars, but they're both definitely worth watching.",

In my opinion, they are all much better than the last two films in the Sequel Trilogy, that is Episode VIII (8): The Last Jedi and Episode IX (9): The Rise of Skywalker. Not to say don't watch them, as I'd rather be mature and say judge them for yourselves, but be aware of the fans' reactions. Some take it rather harshly. But hey, what else is new? You might like them, given the taste of what was introduced in The Mandalorian, specifically the Elite Praetorian Guards - the red guards from the last two episodes of Season 3.\n\n...and just as I finish writing this did I realize you said you've already watched them all. Lol Oops. But yeah, I'm in the mindset that George Lucas's six-film saga is peak Star Wars in the overall franchise, with Rogue One is by far Disney's best film. Hell, it helped Andor be a success. But with all that being said, there is more to catch up on in the galaxy far away.\n\n&gt;He didn't want to watch any of the animated series. Is there anything important we missed?\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, The Clone Wars and Rebels are a must-watch. Especially the fact that you have a 10 year old son to watch them all with. The Clone Wars covers the events in between Episode II Attack of the Clones and Episode III Revenge of the Sith. There is also The Clone Wars movie, but it does have a not-so-good reputation as well, but it is canon...and I may or may not be a sucker for Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. But as far as the animated series, I'd say watch them so you can have a proper background into the Ahsoka Tano character. In my opinion, as good a job as Rosario Dawson did in Mandalorian and likely in future series, I'm a bit nostalgic in saying that Ashley Eckstein is my Ahsoka having voiced her in the animated stuff, which I think is a bit more superior to the live-action stuff (i.e. Mandalorian) thus far. That's all I'm going to say without overly spoiling what the future holds.\n\nThe Bad Batch? Depends on if you like The Clone Wars, specifically the final season. Other animated stuff, like Tales of the Jedi, and Star Wars Forces of Destiny, may not be totally be totally necessary viewings but I think that'll up to you if you're interested. I just watched it all because I'm curious on the lore, and so far, none of it is terrible in my book.\n\nIf you wish to see most of my thoughts on Star Wars, please visit my [Wookieepedia userpage](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/User:J_Fan).",

Clone Wars explains so much more about her past as Anakin's padawan during the Clone War and after she leaves the Order. And it also brings up a lot of very emotional and poignant moments that highlight the terrifying realities of War, slavery, and all the horrors involved there in.\n\nAnd Rebels, by far, was the best of ANY Star Wars content so far. It really fleshes out the Star Wars universe and showed how the \"little people\" of the galaxy were getting along while all the mega battles were being fought. There's a new cast to get used to, but they are all incredibly well rounded, and complex enough that you WANT to get to know them better.\n\nAdmittedly, I initally had trouble getting past the cartoon style animation for both series...

            "comment": "Started The clone wars when I was 20. Stopped after a season because it was a bit childish.\n\nStarted again at 30..season 3/4 ramped it up and turned Maul into a fantastic tragic character rather than just a foil for jedi, made the clones question their purpose, showed the republic is not all good, and the separatists aren't all bad. There's some really nuanced stuff in there under the guide of a kids tv show. They also make Anakin into a likeable character and you get to grow with Ashoka.",

            "comment": "Clone Wars is pretty good. There were omg episodes and some mediocre ones. Shows what happened during Order66 from the clones' perspective and more back story on Akshoka Tano.  Basically see her grow up over 7 seasons. Also back story on Darth Mauls home planet and fight between against Palpatine and he/ his brother.\nSeason 7 was brilliant.\n\nRebels ending was frigging lame ass. But see the final fight between Maul and Kenobi which was done brilliantly.  Also Akshoka vs Vader (her former master Anakin) which was shocking. Also the robot Chopper is hilarious. \n\nOf the 2, Clone Wars was better but Rebels had its moments.",

I personally enjoyed Rogue One and the live action shows and don\u2019t watch the clone wars, but everybody has their own tastes. You could also look into some of the canon and Legends books as well since there is a lot to choose from, depending on your preferences.",

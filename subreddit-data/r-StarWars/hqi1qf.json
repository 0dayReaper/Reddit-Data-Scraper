Yeah, slight exaggeration, but still hella rabbit holes to dive into on imdb\n\nEdit: yes guys. There are other voice actors with long resumes. The industry is still surprisingly small and this was just off the top of my head. But keep looking for  others and adding more. It's impressive just how intertwined the voice acting community is",

We were told that production was ending but also that the final batch would still be grown and trained, and since we see they are still growing batches in TCW it can be assumed they meant last created batch of babies, at the least, since they are already paid for. So the Empire should be getting number of fresh clones every year for at least 10 years, and with no galactic scale war going on the number of clones would only grow. And by the time the last batch is deployed even the oldest clones would only be biologically ~46, still well able to be used as trainers and instructors even if not in the field.\n\nI'd really like this show to give us that answer. Whether it is because of clone PTSD or making the Kamino rebellion canon, I don't care. Either way I think this is a question that needs answering. Otherwise what they've told us doesn't really add up.",

Thrawn only really wanted to turn the Empire towards his own purpose anyway. I'm thinking they get pushed far into the Unknown region. Out so far that the hyperspace routes aren't well developed, so they can't just jump back. Develop Thrawn's species the Chiss a bit more. Take them though a long winding journey through new planets and species, really push the world building/exploration angle. Something like Star Trek, but set in Star Wars.",

The creative staff should probably look to movies like Stalingrad of Das Boot for inspiration on how to make somewhat sympathetic people in a real-life cartoonishly evil regime.

If anything, it\u2019d probably be easier to make stormtroopers sympathetic than Wehrmacht grunts; pretty much all decent people have a (very justified) instinctive revulsion when they see a swastika, while people see stormtroopers as nothing more than the baddies from those movies they watched as kids.",

The first arc of S7 was supposed to give some closure for Domino Squad &amp; progress Rex\u2019s story. That\u2019s why the Bad Batch is called Clone Force 99: it\u2019s a callback to Clone 99, who also had genetic mutations, from the Domino Squad episodes 301 &amp; 302. And the fact that the Bad Batch are all so different from regular clones gives Echo somewhere he fits in, as he\u2019s the only remaining member of Domino Squad.\n\nI feel like if it was Delta Squad, it would be kind of weird for an ARC trooper to join a regular clone commando squadron. And if he didn\u2019t join them, I feel we wouldn\u2019t have gotten as much closure for Echo. \n\nI was, however, surprised by this announcement as I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d choose this arc to make a new series out of. But as long as Filoni is in charge, I have faith. If he can turn the mediocre Clone Wars movie into a great show, he can do the same with this!",

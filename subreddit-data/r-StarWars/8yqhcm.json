My dad and his roommates came back to the room to him trashing it. He was pissed that they wouldn't let him graduate, and he told them all, screw this, in going to California. Even invited them all to come with.\n\nMy dad was on a date with my mom when they went to see American graffiti. He was blown away when his old friend appeared on screen.\n\nWell after he became Han and Indiana, Ripon honored him. As an eight year old, nothing could have been cooler than having Han solo and Indiana Jones walk up to your dad and embrace him.\n\nUnless Chewbacca replies to this. I'll consider my life compete.",

    "postText": "Would anyone like to see a live action film or TV show set before episode 1. Maybe a story centered around a young Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu or Count Dooku. Or maybe we could even see a story centered around Knights of The Old Republic. I know that the Skywalker Saga is supposed to be the center piece of Star Wars but wouldn't it be awesome to see a live action story not set during the Skywalker Saga just for world building and lore.",

And while they're not live action, both Tales of the Jedi and Young Jedi Adventures are set pre-TPM, the former being about ten years before the latter somewhere between 300-200 years before. \n\nI'd be happy to see some adventures set during the High Republic era, let the Jedi actually be successful and uncomplicated big damn heroes. But personally, I don't see a lot of point in going back too far. A distant prequel to the prequels to the original story/setting is just too far removed, to me it might as well just be a completely different universe at that point.",

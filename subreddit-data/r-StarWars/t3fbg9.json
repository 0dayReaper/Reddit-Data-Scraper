I was only freshly 17, and terrified. Not hurt, just shaken super bad. They immediately turned around and helped me out of my car, brought me to their friends place i (luckily lol) crashed in front of, and they let me call police for help. I was given got cocoa and a snack while we waited for the police, and they helped me find someone to drag my car out of the ditch. They were literally my guardian angels. I didn't have a cell phone, and was 8 miles out of town, on a low traffic back road, aka screwed. \n\nAnother time (again in winter, go figure) my mom and I were driving downstate through the adirondacks to see family for Thanksgiving. We were going slow, went to take a slow, slight bend in the road, and the car just kept going straight, and we ended up in the bank. A few minutes later a family in a van saw us and stopped. A young couple and their two young kids. The second they saw us they offered a ride to the nearest gas station with a phone. They really saved us, it was super dark out. But they still saw us in need, and trusted my mother and I enough to let us in their car and help. \n\nA third time, I was in college, living by myself in an efficiency near my school. I didn't have a job, I was living off what the military was paying me a month after my dad passed (rent was 375, and they have me 400$/mo, so beyond my one meal plan meal at college, I was broke). Tried to get a few groceries after class, just some pasta, a small pack of generic hot dogs, and a small bag of carrots, and my card declined. I had no cash and was starving. I almost burst into tears when the person behind me saw, and offered to cover my groceries. Was 10$ tops, but it fed me all week. I'll never forget that sweet old lady. All she said was \"we've all been there, and we all need to eat. It's there anything else you'd like to grab?\" I was so thankful and ashamed I declined extra, but she will always vividly be in my mind. Every time I ate that week I cried thinking of her kindness\n\nSometimes it's just the littlest of actions that mean so much, and leave a lasting impact. I try to pass it on again and again now",

That's the major difference, and there's plenty of different signs for words in each language.\n\nAn interesting fact: the sign ASL use for \"where\" is exactly the same for BSL \"what\" and it's the other way around for the other word in both language!\n\nSign languages in different countries are as different as speaking languages so there's multiple sign languages to learn. Italian Sign Language or Japanese Sign Language etc are different too",

But he didn\u2019t, and he continues to set an example, not only for being an amazing celebrity and doing things like this but by being the kindest and most noble person anyone could be, regardless of the cameras are on him or not. He truly is a Jedi master\n\nEdit: thank you all for pointing out this is not Mark Hamill, but damn it fooled me. He\u2019s still awesome, and so are all the Lukes out there, apparently. Amazing cosplay by u/imflukeskywalker and truly heartwarming seeing this interaction",

Even if it\u2019s just a few phrases, it\u2019s something you worked on just for moments like this and I think it means a lot to Deaf people sometimes. I know a decent amount of sign and I loved the few occasions I\u2019ve responded to a deaf person in sign at work. They\u2019ll often either have written something down or they speak a few words with general gestures and I sign at them and the way their posture relaxes after makes me so happy. Their whole demeanor changes as we start signing and you have a friend for a moment. Deaf culture is really wholesome. I always imagine what it would be like to be someone else and I like to create these moments where someone feels more comfortable in my presence.",

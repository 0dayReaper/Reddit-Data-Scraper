Maul survived getting cut in two by sheer will power and force training, but that drove him mad.

There is plenty of blame to go around, going all the way up to Bob Iger.\n\nThe audience and critics, who ate up Abram's film, which was basically a recycling of the New Hope, have some responsibility on this too. It basically signaled Disney that whatever unimaginative crap they put out the fans would take it gladly and ask for more.",

The problem was that he left nothing for anyone to work with in Episode 9. Luke was dead, Carrie Fisher had passed away so Leia couldn't be the main character, Phasma and Smoke were gone and there was no sign of a new baddie. Even Kylo had taken off the signature helmet. The knights of Ren never really went anywhere.\n\nThat's not entirely Rian's fault though - someone at Disney should have called all that out and had some kind of story arc set up to lead into the last film. Instead they just had JJ pull something out of his ass.",

There are all kinds of sci-fi/fantasy explanations that can be used to retcon a character\u2019s death in this universe. \n\nMaul\u2019s return wasn\u2019t that much less ridiculous in terms of how he managed to survive.  The difference is that Maul was essentially a walking plot device in Phantom Menace, a character with untapped potential. When he came back in Clone Wars, that potential was actually being utilized for the first time. But now that he has finally run his course, I would generally oppose him making any further appearances, unless they took place before Twin Suns. \n\nPalpatine was already a fleshed out character with a fitting demise. I think Palpatine returning for any reason after Return of the Jedi is lazy and boring, regardless of how good the writing is. Pick a new villain. I thought Snoke had potential before someone decided that he was actually a failed clone of Palps. Even after Snoke died, I thought it might be interesting if Kylo was actually the main antagonist of the third movie. Or if he turned good, let Hux take the top spot. Or maybe throw the whole organization into chaos without a dominant force user to unite them, and they collapse into themselves without the need for a customary final battle. Use some imagination is the common denominator here.",

But just because there's good in Kylo doesn't mean it will come out. Redemption is not automatic. In the original trilogy Luke didn't go \"I still sense good in Vader, so you know, I'm just gonna head home. I'm sure he'll come back to the light side on his own. No worries\".\n\nKylo in both the 7th and 8th movie is a deeply conflicted individual who's at constant war with himself. He's not vader. He's a Vader-wannabe. Of course there's still good in him. I think that was clear from start. But that gives narrative flexibility. You can craft a story where he's eventually redeemed. But you can also craft a story where he falls deeper into the dark side. If written well both can work.",

Even if you go down an evil Kylo, or perhaps a swap where Rey turns evil and Kylo good, you need another film for the character development and explanation for why they turned that way.\n\n1 more film no matter what route they took was never gonna be enough to finish the story. \n\nTLJ should have been episode 7 and heavily tweaked, TFA shouldn't exist because it added nothing. \n\nTROS was easily the worst though.\n\n*Edit - I actually also disliked that the first order even had the upper hand in the story. Id have preferred to see the dark side be the underdogs, an evil rebellion that blindsided the new Republic.",

Such characters as Darth Sion, Vitiate, Darth Zash, Maul (George was always planning on bringing him back in some capacity), and even fucking Palpatine himself have been long established in canon as different methods to survive/circumvent death entirely\n\nThis is all very much a key component to the mythos of Star Wars and one of the most important feats available to those who use the dark side, so either you can get mad at Disney for how it was executed or get mad at George for making immortality a very important part of the Star Wars universe",

At the end of Bane's reign he was worried his apprentice, whom he found and raised from a 10 year old girl, was too sentimental and wouldn't kill him/ waiting for him to become inferm and take it because of his weakness instead of her strength. Thus he searched for a way to prolong his life and have time to find a new apprentice. He found an ancient Sith ritual for an essence exchange, or something, where he could take over someone's body. \n\nHe hoped to create a clone, but through circumstances had to try to take over his apprentices body during their final conflict. The story is left open ended, giving hints he did take her over, or at least his force spirit is in her. \n\nDarth Plagueis, the emperor's Master, spent much of his life creating clones and using the force/midichlorians. Possibly even the creation of Anakin himself. If Bane had actually been moving bodies from master to apprentice this whole time he would have thousands of years to develop powers involving his sprit. \n\nPossibly if he hadn't completely taken over his original apprentices body, he may have created some sort of piece of himself like a spirit in her. This then gathered the spirit of every sith after and this force consciousness darkside thing passed on to each new sith when they killed their master. This entity freed itself from needing a body finally upon Darth Sidious's death. That's what we see in the last movie. It looks like Sidious because that was the final body it was in.",

However, this process causes the clone body to decay and fall apart, leaving him crippled. \n\nIt's the same idea as transfer essence. Most sith transfered into inanimate objects, Sidious tried to use a clone but it has the side effect of destroying the clone body.\n\nSidious believed if he used Rey's blood/life force connection to him he could restore the clone body to health OR that he could inhabit her body without it decaying due to her part clone/part human/Sidious relation. That part is a bit open to interpretation.",

(why isn't his master Plagius still around if he mastered cheating death?, there's 2 parts to the process, the ability to cross the veil of death and having a force sensitive body waiting to be possessed, plagius didnt have the mass resources Palpatine aqquired when he became chancellor/ Emperor nor access to the Kamino technology or Pershing research)",

I think if I remember correctly the blast of light that comes up out of the shaft is basically his life force coming back out.  I thought the comic suggested Vader almost succeeded in killing Palpatine because he had no time to prepare.  In that version of the Emperor and in other books, Palpatine was being eaten alive by the power of the dark side so he switched to a new clone body on a regular basis and that\u2019s why he looked so weird looking(which has since been retconned by episode III).  But it was supposed to be an orderly affair when a clone was ready.  He escapes but barely.",

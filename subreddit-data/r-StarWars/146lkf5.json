    "postText": "I'm sure this has been posted in the sub many, many, MANY times before but I was just rewatching The Empire Strikes Back and every scene Vader was in made me realize how much I love his character. He's immensely powerful, has an interesting backstory, amazing character arc, great pilot, great in combat, saved his son, has a badass suit, deep intimidating voice, one of the most recognizable sounds in cinema history (his breathing) and through all the pain and suffering he's been through, he can still control his anger and frustration. For example, when Kylo Ren gets mad, he just destroys everything and everyone he sees. When Vader gets mad, he can actually control it and think strategically and rationally without murdering his entire bridge command. Darth Vader is one of the most basic favorite characters in Star Wars, right up there with Luke and Han, but dammit it's for a great reason. (Boba Fett is also right up there with Vader in terms of favorites for me)",

            "comment": "Darth Vader is hands down the most well written Star Wars character but I enjoys Sheev Palpatine's charactar arc more though because he's cunning, highly intelligent, charismatic, ambitious, can be a trusted mentor to the Jedi, politician, mastermind and the boss of Sith lords at the same time, ruled the Galaxy and he also has interesting story. \n\n\n\nBy the way, both Darth Vader and Palpatine are definitely goated characters. Revan is close second, he's a cool and great character with interesting story, highly skilled and intelligent too.",

Rey just is not well-written whatsoever. How does a girl with barely any training at all beat a guy in a lightsaber battle who's been training basically his whole life? It just doesn't make sense. Even Anakin, one of the most gifted Jedi that ever lived, needed immense training before he could actually go out and fight",

            "comment": "It all depends on where you are and who you ask.  \n\nThe reason the prequels seem so much better loved on Reddit, Twitter, etc, is probably because those platforms biggest age demographic (people in their twenties and early thirties) are the same people who grew up with the Prequels.  And they have a lot of fondness for them.\n\nThe kids for whom TFA was their first real Star Wars theater experience are getting older.  It's hard to imagine those kids don't harbor significant fondness for those characters and that story.  If you can find a social media platform where those youngsters are the dominant voice, it seems likely that such a social media platform would be a lot less hard on them than a lot of Reddit is.  You wouldn't have to wait ten years.\n\nBut statistics show that Reddit in particular, just isn't that popular with the teenagers who would frequent such a social media site.\n\nSimilarly, if you waited a decade but only looked on social media mostly popular with people who were in college when TFA came out, the narrative might not change as much as you'd hope.  Nostalgia is a powerful agent, but folks born in the early 2000s and before are probably always going to be harder on the ST than people who saw it when they were 7.\n\nMost forums like this one are not very good representations of the entire fandom.  And I think it's good to keep that in mind.",

Grogu is a pretty big deal at my nieces school.\n\nBut that's just one group of kids, so that evidence isn't worth much.  Neither is yours for the same reason.  The toy aisles where I live have about as many Star Wars toys as they have Marvel toys.  But those are just the stores near me.  It's all anecdotal evidence.\n\nWe need evidence a lot stronger than anecdotal evidence if we're going to claim that an entire generation has abandoned Star Wars to such a massive extent that there won't be any nostalgia for (checks notes) the fifth highest grossing movie of all time.",

It's probably the 2nd most successful Star War behind the original.\n\nBut the financial success wasn't really my point.  My point was that a TON of little kids saw that movie.   It wasn't just a hit, it was a massive hit with FAMILIES. If only a fraction of those kids had a strong positive response. . . Any hope of the ST being forgotten by future generations of fans is pretty much dead in the water.\n\nAlso:  I've never been able to find a source for that oft quoted fact about toy sales.  But if it's true, it's probably good to remember that correlation doesn't imply causation.  \n\nWhat's more likely?  That kids abandoned Star Wars on a historic level?  Or that kids still like Star Wars and just aren't as into dolls in general as they were 20 years ago?",

What I'm saying is far more nuanced.  Which is probably why my original comment in this thread is on the more popular side.\n\nHuge numbers of kids saw TFA.  Adults tend to be nostalgic for movies they saw as a kid.  When you're nostalgic for something, you tend to not be as critical of it.   And that changes how you talk about it.\n\nIs that not an incredibly reasonable line of logic?\n\nEverything else I've said has been to bring into question refutations of that logic.\n\nI brought up potential (and reasonable) speculative confounding variables to demonstrate how correlation doesn't imply causation.  I don't think the thing you're saying about the Mando spike precludes the possibility.  of the confounding I mention.  But even if it did, the burden of proof would still be on you to show causation.  There are plenty of other things that could be causing those trends.\n\nI could say something similar about your claim about the TFA/TLJ box office drop.  Yes, there was a drop, but you haven't shown that this drop implies a near total breakdown in childhood nostalgia.  Indeed, other Star Wars movies have had massive drops in box office over the years. (See ANH/ESB and TPM/AOTC) and that didn't seem to hurt the pipeline of childhood nostalgia much.  What makes you think this time is different?  The burden of proof is still on you.\n\nYes TLJ and TROS have had significant backlash online.  I think I've shown in this thread that there's good reason to think this doesn't necessarily say anything about how youngsters feel.\n\nNow, I could be wrong about all of this.  I'm open to that possibility.  If there's strong evidence that there's a cultural force breaking the typical trends of childhood nostalgia, I'm open to hearing it.  But so far I haven't seen anything very convincing.  And until i do, I think it's VERY safe to assume that the normal trends of pop culture nostalgia will work on the Sequels pretty much how they work for other popular movies.\n\nMaybe that won't look exactly how it looked for the OT or PT.  But it seems unlikely that it won't happen at all.",

Both AOTC and ROTS were beaten out by the likes of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Marvel movies at the box office. Harry Potter and Marvel have become much more a part of the zeitgeist than Star Wars, and I'd say that a large part of that is down to the Prequels failing to live up to expectations (to put it mildly). I don't think that the ST failing to overturn a decade-long trend is really one of their failings.\n\nEdit: sp",

Kids are more into spending money on Fortnite skins than plastic toys these days.\n\nOh, and yeah, the interest in The Clone Wars was minimal and has only increased as the children who watched those shows have gotten older. Adults at the time couldn't have cared less, for the most part.\n\nThe Sequels and the Disney takeover has reinvigorated Star Wars after some quiet years and a lack of interest after the disappointing Prequels films.",

The characters were generally likable and felt like they had potential. The dialogue was also probably the best - we know about the prequels problems and I find the OT dialogue really campy or dated feeling. \n\nIt was well received and was a top box office hit of all time. I think if the story had a little more originality (or had even just adapted some EU stuff) it would be without a doubt the best star wars film out there. \n\nThere are two things holding it back today. 1, a lot of it felt like copy paste from other star wars movies. 2, it's sequels retroactively make it worse by destroying a lot of the potential that the characters felt like they had.",

The stereotypical fanboy, who howled about George Lucas destroying his childhood, all the while having committed the trilogy to memory and having spent thousands of USD equivalent on them. People bought a lot of prequel era content and merchandise and the movies kept being discussed. \n\nThe sequels are, on the other hand, treated with disappointment. No one is watching them.\n\nThe Prequels did world building to a degree never seen before. This is what allowed so much content to flow from them. And gave us stuff like the Clone Wars which eventually redeeemed them.\n\nThe Sequels, yeah no.\n\nPlus the prequels were a revolution in film making. They really were innovative and at the bleeding edge. The sequels were a by the numbers production.\nAnd let\u2019s face it, the prequel really resonate more in an era where we are witnessing the rise of militarism and right wing political ideologies. The \u201cthis is how liberty dies\u201d line was cringe in 2005. In 2023 it\u2019s uncomfortably close to home.\nIf the sequels are ever redeemed, it will be for different reasons.",

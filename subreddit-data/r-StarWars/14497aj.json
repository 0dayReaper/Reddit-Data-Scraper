    "postText": "Very new to the High Republic content since it seemed confusing to me from the jump. So far I'm focusing on the adult novels (Light of the Jedi, Rising Storm, Fallen Star) and love them. I'm about to start Fallen star and was told by a friend that the Phase 2 books jump backwards in time.\n\nIs there any sort of conclusion to the characters from these novels? I know most probably aren't around during Phase 2, but has anything been said about them returning to them later on in Phase 2 or even 3?",

I'm assuming that the intention was to have Phase 2 to introduce more context to the past of the Nihil, and then bring it together in Phase 3... But until then you have a cliffhanger on one end and starting all over again with a completely new cast of characters on another end.",

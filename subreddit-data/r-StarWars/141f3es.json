    "postText": "Before I begin I will say that the read I've done this is for fun I've seen people constantly rewriting the sequel or the prequel\n\nBut ESB is my second least favourite film so I thought I would try and rewrite it \n\n\nPhase I:\n\n  \u2022  Show the Empire struggling to recover from the destruction of the Death Star, with riots erupting on several planets such as Coruscant, Naboo, and others.\n\n  \u2022  Stormtroopers are sent to suppress the riots, using force to maintain control. \n\n  \u2022  Luke attempts to convince Leia to establish a new base for the Rebel Alliance to support the planets revolting against the Empire.\n\n  \u2022  Han Solo is absent as he embarks on a dangerous mission to pay off his debt to Jabba the Hutt.\n\n  \u2022  Obi-Wan appears to Luke, cautioning him against interfering in the riots and reminding him of the Jedi's non-interference philosophy.\n\n  \u2022  Luke decides to continue his training by seeking out Yoda on the planet Dagobah.\n\nPhase II:\n\n   \u2022 Luke arrives on Dagobah and begins his intensive training with the wise and eccentric Yoda.\n\n  \u2022  Yoda guides Luke through rigorous physical and mental exercises, honing his lightsaber skills and deepening his connection to the Force.\n\n  \u2022  Through their training sessions, Luke gradually becomes aware of his own lineage, learning the shocking truth that Vader is his father.\n\n \u2022 Confused and disturbed by this revelation, Luke questions Obi-Wan about why he concealed this information, paralleling the events of Episode VI.\n\n \u2022 Concurrently, the storyline alternates between Luke's training and the Empire's relentless pursuit of the Rebel Alliance, showcasing their attempts to locate the rebels' new base.\n\n \u2022 This back-and-forth dynamic creates suspense and heightens the tension as both Luke and the Empire undergo significant developments.\n\nPhase III:\n\n  \u2022  The Empire finally discovers the location of the Rebel base, prompting Vader to consult with the enigmatic Emperor about their attack plan.\n\n  \u2022  Luke receives a message informing him of the imminent danger facing the Rebel Alliance, particularly Leia.\n\n  \u2022  Determined to help and seeking guidance, Luke sets out to find Han\n\n  \u2022  Luke's search leads him to a dangerous encounter where he persuades Han to return with him to aid the Rebels.\n\n  \u2022  Along the way, they encounter Lando Calrissian, who is gambling with Han and joins them due to his personal desire to meet the beautiful princess Leia.\n\n   \u2022 The trio hurries back to the Rebel base, joining the ongoing battle against the Empire.\n\n   \u2022 Luke engages in a climactic lightsaber duel with his father, Darth Vader, showcasing his growth and newfound skills.\n\n   \u2022 Despite his improved abilities, Luke is ultimately overpowered by Vader and loses his hand, mirroring the iconic moment from the original film.\n\n  \u2022  The film ends with the Empire achieving a tactical victory, but the Rebel Alliance manages to escape with their lives.\n\n  \u2022  A final scene teases the construction of the second Death Star, setting the stage for the next episode and intensifying the stakes for the Rebellion.\n\n\nStill trying to figure out a way to get han frozen for episode 6 starting",

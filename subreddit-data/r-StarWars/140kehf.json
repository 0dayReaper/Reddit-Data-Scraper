And to actually film these things practically... you need to have a new cast.\n\nBut it would have been so easy to keep R2 and 3PO in the foreground. R2 is a roomba attached to a sound board, and Anthony Daniels has been an absolute champ in voicing 3PO in every medium for god knows how long.\n\nYou'd think Disney would have been able to milk those characters just a BIT longer.\n\nAh well... at least we got BB-8! \n...who thanks to LOTJ now has a legitimate body count!",

I know it's old news that Lucas originally pictured it like that with Hidden Fortress and all... but I always liked that little detail. \n\nIt felt like it was true in Eps. 1-6. R2 or 3PO was always connected to a major player in the series at any given time. 3PO's memory wipe at the end of 3 kinda fucks with that a bit.\n\nI really like the sequels for the most part. They got a lot going on for them. But I still remember that was the first thing I talked about missing after seeing Ep 7. Those two were sidelined.",

The stories and content sort of alter and shift as people add their voices to it, just like the stories of the Greek/Roman/Norse gods changed over the centuries. That\u2019s why the idea of some story elements breaking canon has never particularly bothered me. It\u2019s a shared universe; different people add and subtract different things as the stories continue to get told. I like that it changes and evolves as different people add their contributions.",

It's also not that big of a stretch to suspect the Jedi are just wrong about them, and that simply midichlorians are attracted to force sensitive beings.\n\nThinking about it further, I think it's kinda silly how much people get worked up about small details that aren't super important.",

It seems to me he was manipulated by the sith in the same fashion as Anakin, being lead to believe the power he would gain would help him save his people and his planet.",

The juxtaposition between qui gons funeral and Vader's later is very good, the first is a solem affair and marks the beginning of the fall of the Jedi and rise of the emperor, the second is a happy celebration showing rebirth and hope.",

I really enjoyed most of season 1, but mostly because it both felt fresh, and also in many ways felt like a return to \"old\" Star Wars.\n\nSeason 2 no longer felt fresh, and didn't feel all that consistent with itself. I enjoyed it a lot less. Season 3 was to season 2 what season 2 was to season 1, so I didn't enjoy it much at all, to be honest.\n\nIf the same thing happened again with season 4 I'd rank it lower than the Book of Boba Fett and Kenobi.",

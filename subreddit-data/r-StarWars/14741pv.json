Raises the frigging dead? entombs a man in stone and leaves him to die? draws her powers from the Dark Side nexus of Dathomir? But still, she is unambiguously a good person. \n\nwhich illustrates the crux of the issue - the fandom will love and eagerly accept without question a gray force user in a story if it's done well and thematically fits. it's certain types of wish-fulfillment characters that cause the idea of gray Jedi to attract such ire.",

His opponents in the game were both Jedi who lost their battle with the dark side. His master cut herself off from the Force when she felt herself falling, and was able to climb back and win her fight with her dark side. Merrin even says that when Cal faces his dark side, she'll be there to help him through it, so he won't have to be alone. \n\nLike it's so clear what the narrative is, but people see dark side abilities and then say, \"it's a Grey Jedi!\" without any further discussion.",

It\u2019s about learning to *not lose* that fight despite circumstances. The way I interpret it, they will always have to live with their darkness, they\u2019ll just have to learn to do it without succumbing to it. They\u2019ve all gone through incredible trauma, they\u2019ve lost everything, and that\u2019s not something you just overcome, it\u2019s something you learn to live with. The ending speaks of teaching Kata to navigate through her darkness, because she too will have to deal with it as she grows up.\n\nI think it\u2019s telling that at the end of the game the menu goes back to blue but you keep the dark side special. It could be a gameplay thing, or it could be that Cal *does* learn to use the dark side without succumbing to it. I guess we\u2019ll only really know once the story is continued.",

If we say Grey Jedi are lightside users that also use the darkside, then that would literally describe so many Jedi, the first coming to mind is Mace Windu. You can't give a shit definition that fits actual canon characters then say it's not real.\n\nDescribing them as former Jedi that form attachments, use/feel their emotions would be a far better descriptor. They are constantly at risk of going to the darkside if they don't keep control of their emotions, but since they can keep control, they stay in the light, therefore being \"grey\" Jedi. \n\nIn fact that description is exactly what the Jedi were supposed to be before they made up all those rules of conduct that made them shut away their emotions. This would make Grey Jedi Jedis since they are what the prequel Jedi are supposed to be. Prequel Jedi made themselves more vulnerable when they *had* to face their emotions because they never really dealt with their emotions before and therefore made themselves susceptible to the darkside. Revan even says that the Jedi would be the most powerful force users if they allowed themselves to feel emotion while staying in control.\n\nEpisode 1-6 are proof of this by 1-3 being about how *wrong* the Jedi were and 4-6, proving that a Jedi could have emotions and attachments while controlling them. This is why Luke was able to bring balance back to the force. Until the sequels changed the whole narrative later in his life.",

As far as Lucas has always been concerned, the dark side corrupts. Period.\n\nI think most of the trouble arises from many people fundamentally misunderstanding what Lucas means when he refers to \"balance\" in the Force. He has never meant balance *between light and dark*, be it within an individual or across society. Rather, he's simply talking about *peace and tranquility*.\n\nReal power comes from enlightenment, and enlightenment comes from achieving peace both internally and externally. What's one of Lucas's earliest expressions of this concept?\n\n&gt;I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\n\nOur true strength flows from our acceptance, without judgment, of our own weaknesses and place in the world. We can't deny the darker thoughts and feelings we may experience, but we must not *feed* them. Every time we do, we lose a bit of ourselves to the darkness.",

It's a religion and an order.   \n\n\nThe other is the idea that somebody can live/act outside of the tenents of the Jedi Order without falling to corruption and this is very possible.   I find the Jedi (and Sith) two very flawed orders, insular and inflexible.  We have seen in canon the force is far more broad than what he Jedi practise and the Jedi (at least by time of their fall) seemed little interested in learning new things, prefering to stick to a rigid tradition.  The fact that several of their order fell right under their very noses speaks to their lack of vision, and, pardon the expression, having their head up their arse.  \n\nFor me, I would be interested in seeing a force user more in touch with their feelings than either the Jedi (Conceal don't feel) or Sith (Anger, Hate, Jelousy only pls).  \n\nThe closest I have seen really is Kanan and Ezra, while they were taught some jedi techniques they both seemed far more in touch with their feelings than typical stoic jedi.",

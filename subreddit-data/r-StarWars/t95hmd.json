Starting them off with Ep 4 or Ep 1 has usually been more of a miss than a hit. Ep 4 is too old for them, Ep 1 too childish. But Rogue One they always love.",

That's like a movie starring Hawkeye or Bucky Barnes (esp. in a backstory way) making almost as much as Endgame.\n\nI honestly hope that whomever is working on Star Wars realizes that the strength was always the universe, not the Skywalkers... even back when Legends was a thing, the stories that were /good/ were the ones that minimized the Skywalkers or introduced a lot of non-Skywalker characters.",

I didn't bother seeing it. Which really says something since my fireplace I'm sitting next too has a stormtrooper, 2 little Millennium Falcon statues and a Yoda statue.\n\nI've seen everything related to Star Wars dozens of times, even watched Mandalorian twice and lots of Droids and Ewoks as a kid. The only thing I haven't seen is Ep.9 \n\nI eat up good and bad Star Wars stuff because it always felt like the writers and directors cared about the characters even when they were making Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure.",

That alone was nice to see because it was a cool scene that actually made sense with the story, obviously Krennic reports to somebody. It also sets up the hallway scene to begin with, explaining why everyone was where they were when Ep. 4 starts, and also giving us a visual example of why Vader was so goddamn terrifying. 5 stars.",

My friends and I discussed it, and we realized that was the moment that \\*the fear of Darth Vader was reinstalled back into the franchise.*\n\nIn Ep. 1-3, we saw his human side--heck, the \"NOOOOO\" scream became a meme joke. In Rogue One, we got to see the full-on remorseless killing machine that made everyone fear him in Ep. 4-6, and for good reason.",

Instead of a huge blast of menacing horns announcing its arrival, everything gets really quiet with just a few delicate, somber strings.  It\u2019s so sad and tragic sounding, but it adds so much weight to the scene, like \u201coh, I guess this is it then.\u201d  One of my absolute favorite moments of the movie.",

I'm trying to figure out how to put this so it doesn't sound like an attack on you.\n\nYour point is totally valid, and there's, of course, a ton of deep lore out there to know, that you might not. But all of star wars makes it clear that faster than light travel has been around for tens of thousands of years. Technology, in a general sense, doesn't really advance anymore, outside of specific engineering applications (like the death star) which are usually just a matter of scale. This is \"point A.\"\n\nPoint B is that Finn WAS a stormtrooper. He knows the technology they have. And they've had jetpacks for a while. Hell, we've almost cracked jetpacks... giant troop transports that lift up into the air and fly off into orbit with no downward thrust are WAY more advanced than a smoke spewing jetpack. \n\nSo, combining point A (it's stupid for ANYONE in Star wars to ever be incredulous about any technology) and point B (its especially stupid for Finn to be incredulous about *ahem* \"their\" technology, when he WAS \"they\" a scant few years earlier) only leads to one conclusion: incredibly shit writing. Like a, really, really shitty attempt at a joke. That's got nothing to do with the amount of lore you, personally, know, it's just shit writing. \n\nR2D2, literally in this case, has forgotten better writing than we got from the rise of Skywalker.",

How could they possibly have thought it was going to work, making it up on the fly? How did they get so much fucking money with literally no story written? My opinion of the sequel trilogy has only soured, and toxified, ovet the years. I NEVER thought I'd say this, but the prequels look good in comparison, even if their dialog was also a shambles. They had a story they were telling, and did so competently and with some structure. They, at least, had a plan.",

As a 50 year old dad (now) and to watch my life pass before my eyes with the original cast coming back in character....what a thrill. .... till I watched it :( . Disney destroyed the Golden goose and the entire franchise. Horrible writing, loose plot, rushed story, just lousy as hell. So disappointed.  Ruined a once in a lifetime opportunity to make those movies immortal, like the first 3. \n\nRogue One was fantastic.  The closest feeling, tempo, and storyline (filled in some holes) since the original.  The last scene with Vader, r2d2,  and Leia was perfect. What a shame they destroyed the only opportunity to get those movies right. Starts with upper management it's their fault. Marvel never would have had such shotty material.",

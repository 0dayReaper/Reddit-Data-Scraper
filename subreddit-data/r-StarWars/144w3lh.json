I think it makes sense Kenobi won that time around. Death star? Eh, Kenobi let him win obviously. But could he have beat Vader? If we went with a more canonical age and assuming he kept in shape/training after the series? Sure.",

Kenobi was definitely at Master level and Vader had really benefited from Sith training.\n\nAs Kenobi hid, he gradually became weaker. He certainly would have lost at the beginning of the series, sorta had plot armor / movie setup at the end.\n\nVader was definitely stronger by A New Hope as Obi Wan aged and fell out of training while Vader remained active as a Sith.",

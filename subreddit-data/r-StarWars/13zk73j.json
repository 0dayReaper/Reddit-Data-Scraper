I haven't read it to be able to vouch for it - I've heard it's pretty rough, though, and really makes it apparent why the story needed further refining from that initial draft stage.\n\nEdit:  Just finished reading through the rest of the comments section and saw that someone else already brought this up and you've already read it, so... disregard :)",

    "postText": "In the book \"The Tenebrous Way\" during the end of Tenebrouses life he used his Maxiclorians.(Basically another version of Midiclorians he developed so he can do another way of Essence  transfer due to the info of it being lost because of Darth Gravid) Though he would see Plagueis death before the chosen one (Anakin) so he used the Maxiclorians to escape the body. Which destroyed Plagueis ability of precognition due to it mixing with the midiclorians of Plagueis. What if this did not happen would he be unstoppable would be able to see Sidious killing him?",

I said it's in the same universe though. she compared it to  saying if someone watched black widow they also watch the avengers. but that's not the same as if you watch the avengers and black widow you're watching the MCU. same as if you watch star wars episode whatever and the mandalorian you're watching star wars (as in the universe not the movie trilogy). so who's right",

I think her larger point was that you can watch The Mandalorian as an entirely stand alone thing. \n\nHard to say how right that is but I guess it\u2019s subjective if someone can just watch that show without *any* other franchise context and still enjoy it.\n\nI know someone who watched Picard having only ever seen Discovery and SNW as that\u2019s all Star Trek is to them right now, never watched anything else in the franchise. They claim they enjoyed it. Hard to argue with them but I do find it strange since they\u2019re just missing so much context and callbacks.",

Suddenly you could not only watch Star Wars but also read Star Wars.\n\nFast forward to 1981. TESB had been released and the first movie was re-released as A New Hope. Now there wasn't any movie called Star Wars and nothing but. Everything that followed carried the Star Wars logo in addition to an individual title / byline, except for the Ewok movies and the animated Ewok show later on. EU novels, video games, everything was \"STAR WARS - byline\". I'd say it's pretty obvious that the term refers to the franchise as a whole and not just ANH, the OT, or the cinematic movies as a whole.",

She loves the show but isn\u2019t interested in touching any other Star Wars media except the Ahsoka show (maybe). She\u2019s just a casual viewer. \n\nI watch it and love Star Wars. It just depends on whether the show appeals to more than just one group of people and it can stand on its own. She likes the Mandalorian because she likes the dynamic between Grogu and Din. The show is also designed to pretty much be independent from the universe in the first two seasons.",

You are saying because she watching Mandalorian, which resides within the universe of Star Wars, from your perspective she is watching Star Wars.\n\nFrom her perspective, she is watching The Mandalorian, which IS a part of Star Wars, but if she hasn\u2019t seen any other Star Wars media, then she is watching The Mandalorian, not watching Star Wars. Her analogy holds merit under her perception of the reality she lives in. If she watched Black Widow, then she would not be watching the Avengers, but she would be watching the MCU.\n\nEven if she watched a Star Wars movie, or the movies, and The Mandalorian, she would still not be watching Star Wars, because she hasn\u2019t seen the other Star Wars shows, and, more importantly, she wouldn\u2019t consider those shows as watching Star Wars, until she decides that would be redefined as watching Star Wars for her personal perspective, even IF everything she watched resides in the Star Wars universe.\n\nAn individual\u2019s perspective is subjective to what they think, thus they create their own reality. Within that reality, said person can believe anything they want as long as they\u2019re the one dictating that reality. Now, this reality, also, exists, and overlaps, within the general perceived reality. This brings me to the point of why I think you\u2019re both right. In this situation, both you and your mom seem to be arguing over two different things, but really they\u2019re the same thing. The trick is accepting that your mom\u2019s perspective is as true as your perspective, that will help you to understand that both answers are correct. Both parties are right, none are wrong.",

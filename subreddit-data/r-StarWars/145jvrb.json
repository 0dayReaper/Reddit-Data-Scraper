            "comment": "I'm pretty sure they just mean \"during his absence\". As we're being shown in some of the Disney Plus shows and other supplementary materials, the seeds of the First Order were already being planted long before Luke's exile, but they didn't become a formal faction yet. \n\nMaybe there's an argument to be made that Luke's disappearance and Ben Solo's fall was what emboldened them enough to start making their presence known, but I'm not familiar enough with the content outside of the films and shows to say if that's been explicitly stated anywhere.",

Maybe they were anticipating a show running up to this after ROTJ.",

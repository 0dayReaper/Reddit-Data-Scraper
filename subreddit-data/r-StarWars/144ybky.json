This isn't that, it's just celebrities being there, nothing like the namesake of jumping over a shark and taking a normally true-to-life show into a fantastical place.\n\nSecond, they were barely in the episode. Now, I think this episode was 100% the weakest of this season, which is the weakest season so far. And their inclusion felt off and weird. But they're not on screen long, and it can just become the episode you skip on re-watches. Every show has at least one.",

    "postText": "To this day I so not understand several details between major events of ep 1 and 2:\n\nEvent 1:\n\n Syfo Dias has a vision of a great conflict and orders the Clobe Army for the Republic\n\nQuestion:\n\n1) When and how did Dooku discover about the army and had the chance to order Inhibitor chips?\n2) Why when Syfo Dias ordered the army they didnt have a DNA donor? I understood that Dooku recruited Jango. If so, when? Also: Jango technically knew at least Dooku is controling the war since he saw both armies and his connection with them. Eventually those armies caused destruction on Mandalore.\n\nEvent 2:\n\nThe Clone Wars\n\nQuestion:\n\n1) If Palpatines whole point of the war was to eradicate the Jedi and get total power, what was his plan if Anakin died in the war?",

Anakins fall was a cherry on top of their victory, not the linchpin and they only even learned he existed after a thousand years of planning culminated in sparking the government crisis at Naboo. \n\nAnakin falling was worked into it because holy hell was he powerful and holy hell would it be amazing to be the sith who not only killed the jedi but stole the chosen one from them. What better show of his dominance on the force? But he didn't need it to happen.",

            "comment": "&gt;\"Around the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum requested Sifo-Dyas conduct clandestine negotiations with the Pyke Syndicate, and he headed for Oba Diah with Valorum's personal aide, Silman. However, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, who was Sifo-Dyas's friend and former Jedi Master Dooku, betrayed him by hiring the Pykes to target Sifo-Dyas's T-6 shuttle. The Pykes shot down his ship over the Oba Diah moon. Sifo-Dyas died in the resulting crash, but Silman survived and was taken prisoner by the Pykes. Consequently, Tyranus and his Sith Master, Darth Sidious, funded Sifo-Dyas's army of clone troopers, hired the bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve as a genetic template, instructed the Kaminoan cloners to add Order 66 to the clones' behavioral modification biochips (which Sifo-Dyas originally intended to be a safeguard against any treacherous orders given to clones), and manipulated the Jedi Order into taking command of the army when the Clone Wars erupted. It was not until years later that the Jedi began to unravel the Sith's conspiracy and unearthed the details of Sifo-Dyas's demise.\"\n\nhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sifo-Dyas\n\nAnakin was no more than a tool for Sidious' plans. He would have found another.",

            "comment": "Regarding event 1, I believe Syfo Dias went to Dooku for help because Dooku had left the order by that point. They were old friends so he thought he could trust Dooku. Dooku had Syfo killed and took over the project. Not sure of the exact time but i think it happened around Episode 1, maybe a little before. \n\nRegarding event 2, if Anakin died palpatine would have just needed to find a new apprentice. His entire plan did not hinge on Anakin joining him, that was just good timing on his part.",

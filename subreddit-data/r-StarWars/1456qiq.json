    "postText": "I have been reading up on threads of this and the idea is always shot down and dismissed like it\u2019s not even worth considering. I understand the reasoning of not wanting to alienate the franchise for future kids and that SW was always meant for children. I just think there is room for both to exist and that there is an untapped market for darker and more mature, gritty stories in this universe that George Lucas created. an example would be the Darth Vader comics, especially the 2017 run. Why is the majority so vehemently against this idea?\n\nIt would lead to better writing, more complex character development, a more coherent plot and less \"cringe\" moments. I\u2019m thinking Game of Thrones level maturity in a sci-fi enviroment. Does this not appeal to anyone?\n\nOn the ending note, i\u2019m not advocating shifting the entire format entirely, just a small portion for us who grew up with this franchise and want to still be interested in it but has not been able to connect with the new stuff as an adult.\n\nEdit: most here have mentioned the show Andor which I haven\u2019t watched because I heard basically nothing about it and assumed it was more of the same. I will definitely give it a watch from what you all mentioned to me here.",

            "comment": "Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by \"more adult\".\n\nthis sub is pretty pro-Andor.  And that's a shows that makes less attempt to appeal to children than any other big Star Wars project.  So in that way, I think your assessment that this sub hates the idea of \"more adult\" Star Wars is just flat out wrong.\n\nBut kids can still watch Andor.  It may not be as targeted at kids as the saga films.  But it is not inaccessible to them either.  I think that's a place where a lot of people draw the line.  No R-rated horror, no excessive cursing, no nudity.  Keep it accessible to kids.\n\nI also think some people bristle at the idea that \"more gritty\", \"more adult\" or \"darker\" media inherently leads to better writing.  That just doesn't ring true.\n\nI've seen movies targeted at 10-year-olds that i thought had fantastic writing, and movies designed to appeal only to adults, that were unwatchable.  Most people have.  So I think it kinda pisses people off when people suggest a causal link there.\n\nAnd that goes double for Star Wars fans.  The OTs ability to appeal to kids AND their parents is an incredibly important part of the series' DNA.",

This post is ultimately super vague. \n\nI think Andor is fairly adult-oriented, for example, and arguably the most mature Star Wars has ever been. The show is pretty deeply invested, thematically, in the mechanics of fascism and the banality of evil. It involves deep-rooted ideologies, radicals *with manifestos*, and it also seems to highly-value the power of resistance, both in terms of violent and nonviolent protest. There\u2019s a lot going on there! Is it the most high-brow stuff ever? No, but it\u2019s actually got stuff to chew on.",

It\u2019s really hard explain for me which I get makes it difficult to have a discussion lol. \n\nRevenge of the sith had an extremely dark story but yet the tone of the movie didnt quite reflect just how dark it really was if you know what I mean. It didn\u2019t capture the severity of it and the emotional response therefore is different. Like the movie the pianist for example.

I\u2019m not talking about more serious drama like Andor, as other people have referenced, which I personally enjoy and feel is mature and serious without being grimdark or over the top. \n\nGame of Thrones is quality fiction but it\u2019s dark, violent, and often miserable, which are things that I not only don\u2019t care to see in Star Wars but also think run counter to its core principles and George Lucas\u2019 vision/wishes. \n\nAnd honestly I disagree with the idea that this allows for better storytelling. The entire idea that Star Wars has to be grown-up to be good sort of insinuates that Star Wars is *bad* because it\u2019s for kids which begs the question of why people who think such things still want to be fans. Whenever I want to experience stories like Star Wars in an R Rated setting I turn to franchises like WH40K that has some really fun stories. There are dark fantasy and dark sci fi franchises out there to explore. \n\nBasically - and I\u2019m not trying to single you out specifically - but these suggestions often feel like they come from a place of people either feeling they\u2019ve \u201coutgrown\u201d the franchise or are ashamed of the family-friendly tone of the franchise, and would prefer the franchise to humor their feelings and change to suit their desires rather than keeping an open mind and enjoying the franchise for what it is.",

Given that the calls for more rated R content usually revolve around edgier characters like a Sith or  Boba Fett, I feel like what they have in mind is more so the latter type of \"mature.\" While I think that has it's place in other media, I don't know if it suits Star Wars and don't think they're inclusion would inherently elevate a story. \n\nAlso I know it's been said already, Andor definitely has the former bit of maturity.

I genuinely thought you were being sarcastic because there\u2019s no way a grown adult could think Clone Wars is the darkest Star Wars content haha, it\u2019s a cartoon for children. I\u2019ve seen it all the way through multiple times and I have no idea where this \u2018the clone wars is soo dark and grown up\u2019 meme came from. Yeah I guess some people die, maybe it just seems more extreme to you because it\u2019s in a cartoon format? \n\nOP is asking for mature content akin to Andor and you\u2019re here suggesting the clone wars cartoon, you don\u2019t see how funny that is?",

It's a sacred and perfect morsel of creation made by St. Filoni himself... that kind of talk might get you disintegrated, lol... ;) \n\nBut yea, I agree with you, it's funny how many people think that CW has this incredibly mature and complex writing. It's a good show, and I liked it, but so much of it is really very childish, and even the parts that aren't are not some irreplacable amsterpiece as it's often praised here.",

I dont want to spoil it but anyone who's seen it knows why it is dark. Apart from that we had actual slavery, biological warfare, terrorism, assasinations, brain parasite zombies, piracy and so many brutal on screen deaths nearly every episode. You are right, it is funmy because Clone Wars is much darker than Andor.",

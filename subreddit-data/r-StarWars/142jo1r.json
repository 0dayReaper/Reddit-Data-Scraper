Usually the unspoken assumption is that a jedi who leaves on good terms with the Order will always be welcome back. \n\nThe only catch is of course that most Jedi grow up with everything being provided to them by the Order. And when they leave, that \"everything\" goes away very quickly, as Ahsoka discovered first-hand. \n\nWhich is why many jedi who are leaving usually come to this decision slowly and already have the fall-back plan in place, like a loving family for example, or a clan of mandalorian cultists. So when they leave and give up their lightsaber, they don't need to look for a job ASAP.",

If you wish to leave the path of the Jedi, it only stands to reason to surrender your \"badge of office\". And in any case, it's not like the Order can stop anyone from assembling a new lightsaber if the need for it arises, especially in old canon where lightsabers are not so strongly tied to  specific magical crystals. \n\nThis though was not really strongly enforced. It's just matter of commitment. I mean, if you don't want to be a jedi, but still want to wield a weapon of one?.. Do you REEEEALLY want to quit or just throwing a tantrum?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Also, second thought, how does the Jedi Order financially support itself?\r  \n\r\n\nThere are several options, which are not mutually exclusive. \n\nPrimarily, the old money - the Jedi are many thousands of years old. Wealth tends to settle over time. \n\nThen of course various donations and sponsorships from people sympathetic to their cause. In some cases some of the jedi might come from wealthy families themselves, which further encourages the money flow. \n\nThird option is the Service Corps. It's not stated how exactly they work, but it would be reasonable to assume that they are not a charity. It's a place where jedi who didn't make it to a Padawan or Knight might end up, where they take up less glamorous jobs like navigators, medics or agriculturists. In old YA novels, younglings humorously treated being sent to AgriCorps as fate worse than death =) \n\nEither way, these people are still Jedi and are strong in the Force, so it's reasonable that their assistance should be fairly compensated.",

I imagine during more peaceful times when a Jedi wanted to leave, they would ask for their weapon. But during the main timeline where the Jedi order is about to be destroyed and war is never ending? I probably would let a Jedi who quit keep the saber lol but I also think more than likely the story writers for clone wars just didn't want to create a situation where asoka had to give up her lightsabers for good. Especially for the fact that a Jedi without a saber during order 66 is going to get destroyed lol they wanted to avoid that I'm guessing.",

Most of it self made, except for blaster (toy blaster from Amazon and painted) and blaster holster, and ofc the lightsaber.\n\nI have several ideas to develop it for the next time I'll be wearing it in October. Add some armor parts if I can (small chest armor, vambraces and leg guards) and a harness similar to Starkillers to display trophies from hunts, but that's very in-concept yet :-)",

She is free to make that choice, even if litterally nobody leaves that situation happy with how it all shook out.",

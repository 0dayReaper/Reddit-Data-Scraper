    "postText": "Due to some reactions to my previous post, had to put it in all caps in the title that I'm a first time viewer, to make it clear I'm not someone trying to dig the sequel trilogy out of its grave to spit on it some more, I'm experiencing them for the first time and just want to share my opinion. \n\nOnce again, it's a mess. Sorry.  We've come full circle, because just like the Force Awakens, the start of the crawl is already controversial. Somehow Palpatine returned. Completely out of nowhere, no foreshadowing, no build up. And it's right in your face, like, movie starts, 2 minutes later he's there. It feels like a desperate attempt to get attention, to save the trilogy, but it doesn't. \n\nSo this time we have a Macguffin hunt, something something, Sith path finder. They kinda ignore the fact the resistance/rebellion is reduced to a few people, I didn't get the sense of urgency and hopelessness I got from The Last Jedi. Rey is still insufferable. Finn is still boring, should have sacrificed himself at the end of previous movie, the friend he made becomes a side character. The fleet of mini-death stars is dumb. \n\nThis movie has some fakeouts which I hate. OH NO CHEWIE IS DEAD! No he isn't. OH NO C3PO IS GONNA SACRIFICE HIS MEMORIES TO SAVE THE GALAXY. No he won't. OH REY IS A PALPATINE , no she can just decide to be a Skywalker. OH KYLO BROKE THE MACGUFFIN. Never mind there's two of them. Then there's the plot conveniences. Oh look, we just happen to fall in the cave where the next glue is! Oh look this random cute droid Disney made to sell toys had a clue for the Macguffin all along! Oh look, Force Healing is a thing!  Every time stuff like this happened I was taken out of the movie. \n\nOne thing is fore sure though,  Ian McDiarmid still got it as Palpatine. He opens his mouth and creates new iconic/memeable lines. \"AS ONCE I FELL SO FALLS THE LAST SSSSSKY WALKAH!\" \n\nAdam Driver's acting is cool too, I grew to like his tamper tantrums. And yeah I couldn't help but noticed them copying Endgame. Took me out of the movie and I was like \"Man I should be watching Endgame instead, would be more fun.\" \n\nI don't have much to say, this trilogy did the opposite the other ones did, just kept getting worse. I'll give this one a 4/10.  \n\nYou know, people say that after this trilogy they started appreciating the Prequels more. I'm one of those people who actually really liked the prequels when I first watched them, and now after watching this \"Anti-Trilogy\" , I just feel more validated for liking the prequels.  Anyway, time to move on.\n\nNot sure if I'm gonna watch the Han Solo movie, is it worth it? Fun at least? If not I'll go watch the tv shows, starting with the Clone Wars in chronological order.",

It's not going to change your life, it's not going to make you apoplectic with rage, it's not likely to take up any real estate on your mind, but it will likely entertain you for its run time.",

And they fixed the twelve parsecs issue which was satisfying to me. It's not as good as Rogue one, but the story actually makes sense somehow unlike the prequels.",

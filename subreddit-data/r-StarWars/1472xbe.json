I will be VERY disappointed if Thrawn orders/kills a crew member and if it seems he's out for blood..... he risked his life and position TWICE for the chiss navi children.... his name means in the chiss language literly means raw defender...\n\nlet me know what you think",

We may get a similar overall storyline as the original Thrawn trilogy and/or NJO, but the details will be different. Sort of how the MCU is taking stories and characters from the comics and turning details on their head to give us something familiar, but unique.",

Nor would there be any reason for Thrawn not to emerge earlier if he was a threat. The Dark Council had no contact with him and were just hoping he would reemerge.",

    "postText": "I just binged on Star Wars Rebels. One scene that stood out was from \"The Last Battle\". Ezra asked that if the Jedi, the Clones, and the Droids all the Clone Wars, then who won? Zeb replies, \"The Empire.\"\n\nThat got me thinking about the Sequel Trilogy. And this is my understanding just from the context of the films, no other materials. to my Understanding, the New Republic is the acknowledged government, The First Order is an expy of the Empire (But I'm not too sure what over), and the Resistance is an expy of the Rebellion to the First Order's Empire (But in order to protect the New Republic). The First Order destroys the New Republic's governing body with Starkiller Base, prompting the Resistance to destroy StarKiller. \n\nI'm not sure what happens, but somehow The First Order is in control of most the galaxy.  The Final Order is launched, but I don't understand if they are joined or Final absorbs the First but its clear that Palpatine is in charge because of reasons. The Resistance, its allies, and just plane everyone who can joins in arrives to destroy the Final Order and Palpatine. I'm not sure if extends to the First Order being defeated as well. We celebrate because...\n\n...\n\nWho won what?\n\nIs the New Republic still around? Is the Resistance all that's left of it? The majority of the galaxy isn't part of the Resistance. Or are they now? Are they going to make the New Republic 2: Electric Boogaloo? \n\nWhat exactly was told?",

            "comment": "Okay so basically, summing up everything regarding the rise of the First Order (to my understanding): \n\nThe First Order obviously has its roots in the Remnants of the Empire. TFO was an underlying threat for a long time and the New Republic didn\u2019t want to do anything about it to prevent another Galactic Civil War. So they let the cancer grow until Leia Organa created the Resistance without the support of the New Republic. \n\nAt first, the fight between TFO and The Resistance was more of a Cold War, lots of spies and espionage. Along the way, TFO\u2019s influence spread to tons of systems across the Galaxy but not in the same way as the Empire. This was more of an underground occupation without outright conquest. Again, the New Republic didn\u2019t do anything about it in order to prevent war. \n\nSo with the immense resources they collected, as well as their stormtrooper program which raised children to be soldiers instead of taking conscripts like the Empire, the First Order eventually started conquering systems in the open, instead of from the shadows. Along the way I\u2019m sure they engaged the Resistance but never directly fought the New Republic. This conquest happened very swiftly and, to those who weren\u2019t aware of the situation before, completely out of the blue. All the while they\u2019ve been turning the planet Ilum into Starkiller Base. The base is activated and they destroy the New Republic, opening the door for full-scale galactic conquest which was already happening, just in the shadows. The Resistance destroys Starkiller but the damage is done and the way for full galactic control is paved. \n\nFlash forward a few years to the time of The Last Jedi. The Final Order was happening in the shadows the whole time without even the First Order knowing. The only ones who knew were Palpatine and Snoke. The Final Order absorbs the First Order, the Resistance and every nerf herder with a ship join in the final battle, Palpatine dies, everything works out. The First Order IS defeated because TFO was absorbed by the Final Order. I\u2019m sure there are remnants out there just like there were with the Empire, but at the end of the day the Resistance wins. \n\nThe New Republic 2: Electric Boogaloo (or Republic 3: Legend of Curly\u2019s Gold, whichever you prefer), will need to be established as there is no governing body at the moment in the Galaxy. They will have to work to build this new government and convince systems to join up, similar to the New Republic post Return of the Jedi.",

                    "comment": "Personally, I'm hoping that they stay away from a New New Republic for a while post-TRoS. Whether it's the old Republic or the Empire, we've always had a galaxy in which a single galactic superpower exists and is either Good and must be defended or Bad and must be defeated. It'd be nice to see a bunch of local/regional powers spring up in the wake of repeated collapses of galactic governance, let the setting explore conflicts where each side has a point and the Jedi can't just swing a lightsaber at the first black-clad figure they see and assume they're bringing down a tyrant.",

I've recently been watching the clone wars series and I notice how easy pressured situations wash off yoda; he seems very at one with the force and all it takes. However, Obi wan is as emotionally bound to ani as he is with padme. He gets frazzled and angry when and makes rash decisions because he deeply cares for him. He hides this love affair for his lovee of him, going against all he stands for.\n\nThen everything ensues, he's forced to confront basically his son, 'kill him, and then run away and care for his child for 18 or so years. Shit that would put years on anyone.",

Sold it to Disney to just get the value and rid his hands of it.\n\nBut if he'd just waited a few more years... maybe could have gotten some of his confidence back, while learning from his mistakes and approaching the sequels more collaboratively.\n\nThe sequels proved that too much George Lucas is better than no George Lucas at all. :(",

Mark said \"sure, when does filming start?\" and Lucas replied \"sometime around 2012\"\n\nThe actual movie would release roughly 30 years later in 2015, after presumably 3 years of filming/production",

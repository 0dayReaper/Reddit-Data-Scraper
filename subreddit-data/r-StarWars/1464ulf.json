    "postText": "I'm rewatching the Obi-Wan series. Obi-Wan protects Leia successfully all the way up to a secret tunnel that leads to a friendly pilot that can finally take Leia home safely. He instead chooses to leave her with someone he just met, who then chooses to leave her completely alone so she can watch Obi-Wan fight Vader?\n\nOk, he knows Darth Vader exists now, there will be plenty of time to deal with that later. For now there's only two people who can keep Leia safe and he's the only Jedi, and he decides to just leave her?",

Obi wan felt he had to try to lead vader away because he was killing townsfolk. Tala believed that no one else would be in the tunnel and felt leia was more than capable of reaching the pilot. Tala went back to help Obi wan. She did not count on Reva outsmarting them.",

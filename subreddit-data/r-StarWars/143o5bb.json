There's a few spots where you see some paint chipped off, but looking at the glare shows not a single scratch on it. And the cloth parts are clean and pressed with not a stitch out of place. I understand Rebels not showing a lot of detail because it's animation, but live-action needs to have that kind of thing considered. Especially for a franchise whose whole aesthetic since 1977 has been \"lived-in universe\". It really kind of takes me out of the new shows sometimes. It's weird, too, because Andor certainly didn't shy away from that. Mon Mothma and the people in her orbit were the only ones who looked immaculate at all times. Luthen was rich as hell and his clothes in the shop scenes reflected that in style, but they didn't look like he'd never worn them.",

Just have to see how they want her played, with how her attitude and mannerisms are. I expect her to be toned down when compared Rebels since she is 8(?) years older now if this takes place during Mando\u2019s era. \n\nThe armor\u2019s color seems about right but damn does it looks like shit otherwise. That\u2019s is nowhere near the wardrobe quality we see for Mando or Bo, hell even the nameless background Mandos have better looking armor than that, minus Sabine\u2019s helmet that looks fine.\n\nReally hope they didn\u2019t skimp on the visuals as bad as this still makes it seem, since so much of Star Wars is the visual emersion imo.",

Also, more matte colors lend themselves better to stealth missions (nearly every mission Sabine does in Rebels is a \"stealth\" op) than extremely shiny, in-your-face colors.",

The only logical and rational thing any business would do after such an astronomical loss would be to enforce massive budget cuts across the board. Disney would be no different. It's pretty obvious that this is the course of action which transpired when watching Mando S3 and then going back and watching either of the first two seasons. S1 and S2 look like a movie, S3 looks like a Stargate episode in comparison.",

Animation always holds something stylized that works in a different way with you imagination and live action takes all of that away. Sometimes you can just let stories end and not gulp up characters again and again so that every fan can connect to. After rebels you could have just ended it there. Not everything needs an answer and ezras where about in particular needs no ending really. \nI am certain my opinion is not the best but this is how i feel and i am looking forward to ahsoka just with an asterisk.",

For humans (or any biological being), not that I recall.\n\nOne of the funniest parts of the ST, to me, was near the beginning of *TFA*  when the First Order Stormies go after Lor San Tekka.  As the camera follows Finn and Co. down the ramp, at the bottom of the screen you see one of the first wave is already dead. :D\n\nAnd they've gone out of their way to say and show that even beskar isn't unbeatable: a powerful enough round, or a close enough one, can punch through it like regular armor.",

Don't see any reason why a SW character should be potentially any less sexy than let's say Catwoman or any other Marvel character.\n\nThis style I think would rather fit Hera Syndulla who's an actual pilot.

You have pockets who despise movies/shows that are other pocket's favorites and there is very little good faith discourse about it.\n\nWatch them yourself and form your own opinions.",

If you're just getting into the series, I'd recommend watching the movies in release order and deciding for yourself if you like them or not. There is far from a consensus on basically everything after the original trilogy, so it would be all too easy to be discouraged from watching any of them because of the communities very divisive opinions on a great many things.",

Oh and you'd better watch return of the Jedi to finish the story though that got a little bit of stick for being a toy commercial at the time.\n\n\nIf you want to know which films you might enjoy? Watch all 9 main films, solo and rogue one",

    "postText": "Luke, has been my favorite ever since I was a child and still is today. I want to show the greatest respect for the character. Inspiring to better myself everyday and try to see the best in people. I have always believed it doesn't matter who you are race, gender, sexuality be the heroes that you saw when you were younger. Luke(and Peter Parker haha) where that for me. No, I don't look like him but I love what he stood for and that is what I feel is the most important. How they inspire us. So... I'll stop talking and say once again thank you \ud83d\ude0a and May the force be with you.",

One October night we were sitting around chatting about a costume party that we were both invited to and, after telling him about my proposed costume, I asked if he was going to be  \"The Bat.\" He looked at me like I was insane and, without a hint of irony in his voice, said \"No way, dude, Bruce Wayne is white.\" It about broke my Blerdy heart.Cheers to OP for doing his thing and doing it WELL!",

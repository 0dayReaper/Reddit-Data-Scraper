So how is it misogynistic? Maybe if Lucas took all the credit for the art then that would be charlatan... But pretty sure everyone that worked on Star wars gets their due credit.",

That part of the comment has nothing to do with Star Wars. She's not calling Lucas or Star Wars misogynistic.\n\nThe only real point that is worth taking away from her comment is she feels filmmaking is a collaborative experience and for something as big as Star Wars; no one person has it all figured out.",

I can't find the interview this was pulled from (and the original poster, Star Wars Theory, never gave the source, which is pretty shitty but that's beside the point).\n\nShe wrote a column about the Auteur Myth (the idea that 1 creative person is responsible for and understands why a movie/show worked and everyone else's great work is because of their vision). She argued that misogyny is a key part of why that was (a lot of women were editors going back to old Hollywood and some credit that as a reason why that job today, no matter who does it, isn't given the credit it deserves).\n\nIt's got nothing to do with George.\n\n&gt;George is the creator, writer, and investor who put up his own money time and effort into creating this once-indie franchise we all love. He owned this whole fking thing, whether other people helped or not. That is why he stood on top, not because he is an oppressive male. I swear, people like this are like those minorities that pull the race card every time they need to get an upper-hand in some conflict. It\u2019s absolutely stupid. (I\u2019m a minority myself and find it so dumb)\n\nI really wouldn't take all that from this short audio clip. This most likely isn't what she is saying at all.\n\n&gt;Did George lucas run the show because he was a male? Or because he owned this fking thing?\n\nNobody is saying he shouldn't have ran the show.\n\n&gt;And we saw what happened without George at the helm of the ship. He is the one who truly understands SW on a deep level, not any of the writers KK hired for the sequels, not their garbage lucasfilm story group. They had their chances and blew it\n\nI don't know how to respond to this because it just seems like you are venting and are reacting the exact way the person who edited this video wanted you to react. I don't like how the sequels went either but that does not mean George understood how to do them either. The grass isn't always greener.",

And I think it\u2019s rubbing everyone raw that misogyny somehow plays a part in this.\n\nI would fight the same fight with the world that JK Rowling created. If your going to create a story based in that universe, it should pay some homage to the artistic intent of the creator. Anything else is fraudulent. The same can be said for the Rings of Power. A lot of people have issues with it because it drifted pretty far away from the cannon that Tolkien created.",

George should have split up the workload and let somebody else challenge his vision. The OT was amazing because he let others do the work with him. The OT would not be the OT without the people he hired. He should have learned that when creating the Prequels.",

As Lucas well points out in many documentaries, films are made in the editing room. \n\nThat\u2019s the only misogyny I can think of. Besides that choice word I see her point. Film is highly collaborative. The myth of one person making the movie is a relatively toxic one. We like to glorify one person, forgetting it\u2019s a pluralistic effort.",

It imagines that films are solely the brainchild of one visionary 'man' who must have complete control over everything for the movie to be perfect. But that's not what actually happens, and the closer reality tries to imitate that myth, the worse the movie ends up being. Phantom Menace is not solely the product of Lucas's imagination by any means, but a lot of the behind-the-scenes commentary revealed that nobody was willing to challenge Lucas on any of his creative decisions. Rick McCallum said as much. The movie could have been a lot better if Lucas had a less dictatorial direction style.",

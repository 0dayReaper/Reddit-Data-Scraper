Need to rewatch the end of Rebels as well but iirc, didn't Thrawn call off the attack as soon as Ezra surrendered like he did?\n\nThat was the only time I can think that Thrawn directly attacked a city like that and I'm pretty sure a big part of that was the Governor Price calling the shots.\n\nLike, similar thing with Nightswan in the novels.\nHe says that if the 'civilian' population put their weapons down and go back home, it would end peacefully.\nNightswan raises quite rightly that whilst Thrawn may care about the civilians and doesn't want to cause deaths, the second he leaves, the machine of the Empire takes over and would kill them anyway.",

He is a strategist and a ruthlessly pragmatic one. He saw this as a way to immediately put a stop to this type of behavior and used it. He doesn't care it was \"cruel\" or \"inhumane\". Legends shows this too. He had his bodyguard kill a bridge gunner on the spot after he failed to shoot something down (no disobedience or insubordination). However, in a similar situation, he promoted a tractor beam operator who failed. The reason was the gunner basically showed no initiative. The escaping craft used the debris of a torpedo explosion or something to confuse the targeting computer and the gunner just kind of waited for it to clear. In a similar situation, the tractor beam operator tried something on the fly to sift through and get it to lock through the debris. Thus he killed one for being incompetent and unmotivated and promoted another for being creative and showing initiative. So the execution and the promotion together had value to motivate his crew toward what he expected. Killing the saboteur did something similar. His methods can still be \"evil\", but there is a distinction between him and other Imperial leaders (Vader was the primary contrast). Thrawn doesn't do \"evil\" things for the sake of \"being evil\". He finds the most effective method that gets him what he wants and uses it.",

He was too good at everything.\n\nI like new Thrawn\u2019s blind spot for politics, and I especially love that he\u2019s not as true to the ideals he espouses as he wants people to think. Yes, he\u2019s a decent man, and he doesn\u2019t do things out of cruelty, but he is first and foremost a military tactician. If killing a bunch of civilians is the most efficient way for him to get results he absolutely *will* do it, no matter how loudly he professes that he won\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes his joining the Empire make sense. In Legends he\u2019s too much of a benevolent dictator type, the updated Thrawn that Tim Zahn gave us feels like a more well rounded and fleshed out version of the same character idea.",

The real answer is probably some mid rim or less important core world defense fleet. Very unlikely to see actual action. Not used for attack, so no risk at any of the major battles. Post battle of Endor, those positions become much more dangerous\u2026 but that\u2019s still more true of attack fleets and groups, and also the now stranded outer rim positions, so a defensive fleet on some mid rim world is still probably most desirable for survivability. Even then, most end up at the battle of Jakku anyway, if they haven\u2019t surrendered yet. \n\nAgain, all assuming surviving is the objective here. If it\u2019s military satisfaction\u2026 then probably Thrawn.",

Having been in the military, your lower enlisted ranks (E1-E5) are so far removed from the presence of Fleet Admirals, 4 Star Generals etc that you might see them one time in your military service. You serve and interact with your immediate command structure. Captain/Colonel(O6) is about the highest rank most lower enlisted service members see or speak to on any regular basis.\n\nTo put this in perspective: Ft. Bragg is the 2nd largest Army post in the entire Army - 50,000+ soldiers. The highest ranking person their is a 3 Star General. To see a 4 Star General or Admiral is rare.  Now apply that to a Navy responsible for covering and entire Galaxy",

Whereas intrigue and political connections normally decides someone\u2019s post. Those officers passed Thrawns work effort down the ranks. Being under thrawn command was like being in a different Navy with a different work culture.\n\nUnder Thrawns command speaking up and questioning orders was not only permitted but encouraged. If you had a valid concern and recommendation it would be taken into consideration. If not Thrawn would turn it into a teaching opportunity. Failure was also not punished if it was due to circumstances beyond your control. \n\nIn a instance when A rate tractor bean operator underperformed and when a B rate operator performed just as well as the A rates he recommended the first get a refresher course and the second a promotion. So even in low ranks if you performed well you had a good chance of being noticed and promoted.",

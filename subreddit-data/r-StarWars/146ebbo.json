            "comment": "G canon is that the Darkside is a corruptive part of the force. Balanced is achieved by removing darksiders from the equation. \n\n it exists and always will but using it is unadvisable because you can't escape the effects of it. As we see in Yodas s6 arc he has to accept it's there and the potential exists but he never is told to embrace it.",

The Jedi order at the time of the prequel trilogy was shown to be flawed, but the Jedi code is not. The dark side of the force uses the force as a path to power instead of working WITH the force and being a conduit for it.",

Life and death, day and night, light and dark. The issue is the dark side is corrupting on people and causes them to act irrationally. Even Yoda admits in the Force planet arc that fear was blinding his senses to the rise of the dark side within himself and around him.",

    "postText": "In Episode 1 there is a prophecy that \"the one will bring balance to the Force\".\n\nSo if the Jedi are in power (and great in numbers) and the Sith are not in power (and their numbers are extremely limited), that would mean the balance is in favor of the Jedi.\n\nAre the Jedi actually self promoting their destruction by taking Anakin Skywalker under their wing, to train him? They must have realized the unbalance in the Force was actually them and not the Sith.",

Bring balance to the force not leave it in darkness!\u201d\n\n\u2022 the Last Jedi: Luke says \u201cthere was balance, for a time\u201d (referring to the time after Anakin killed the emperor)\n\n\u2022 \u2060TROS: Anakin\u2019s voice says \u201crestore the balance Rey, like I did\u201d (when she\u2019s fighting palpatine).\n\nSo everything indicates that the Jedi\u2019s view of \u201cbalance\u201d is correct, with only one weak counterpoint often quoted of Yoda saying that it was perhaps misread, but in context they were questioning whether Anakin was the chosen one. And the Jedi have obvious reasons to doubt this since Anakin did turn to the dark before he returned to the light and destroyed the sith.\n\nEdit: and yes this is all canon both under Lucas and with the new Canon after he sold the franchise.",

That Lucas sold the franchise doesn\u2019t matter *unless* there\u2019s new evidence to contradict this, which there really isn\u2019t any. \n\nAlso out of universe - something that has been maintained by LucasFilm before and after the sale is that Star Wars is a hopeful story and setting to provide people with a positive message - so to argue that the cosmology of the force contradicts this idea by presenting some bleak idea of balance meaning wiping out the good guys and the bad is counterintuitive. \n\nWhen you\u2019re arguing against a position that has the benefit of being presumably true, people are going to call you out without real evidence saying otherwise. \n\nAs to the canonicity of the StarWars.com databank, I\u2019d say it\u2019s held in pretty high regard considering it\u2019s the official website\u2019s encyclopedia (you will even see it cited frequently on Wookieepedia).",

And in that novel another former Apprentice of Dooku questions Qui-Gon on why he assumes that Balance will be a good thing for the Jedi. \n\nAnd now more stories by Disney are showing the cracks in the Jedi and their Philosophy. That same book has them approving Slavery in the Republic, on behalf of the Senate. The Dooku episodes of Tales of the Jedi are more examples.

Like maybe they were too early and Luke was meant to bring balance by redeeming Anakin who in turned kill the Emperor, thus bringing balance to the force. This is also backed up by the interaction between Maul and Obi-Wan in Rebels, where Maul asked Obi-Wan if the child he was watching over was the chosen one, and Obi-Wan confirmed that he was. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he was, just that Obi-Wan believed he was. He also once believed Anakin was, so that evidence is kinda flimsy. I have also considered the possibility that they were right the first time and Anakin really was the chosen one, they were just too early and he wouldn't bring balance to the force until he killed Palpatine and redeemed himself. Like maybe it was his destiny to endure all of the pain and torment to prepare him to make the right decision at that exact moment, as well as giving him the strength to fight through the force lightning long enough and put him in the perfect position to kill Palpatine. So in a roundabout way he actually did fulfill his destiny, although he likely wouldn't have if it weren't for Luke.",

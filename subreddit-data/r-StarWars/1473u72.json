I wouldn't have cared half as much about the death of some guy I'd known for an hour if I'd watched in release order.\n\nI already knew Vader was Luke's father from pop culture and general playground talk so Empire's big reveal wouldn't have surprised me. \n\nEven people who have never seen Star Wars know about that plot twist. Barring those rare few who literally know nothing about Star Wars, I don't see any real reason to watch in release order other than because everybody says so.",

I was hooked on Star Wars with that one, then checked out 1 and 2 at the local library to watch. My local library system didn\u2019t have the original trilogy on DVD at the time so my parents had to find and buy it. Then fast forward a few years, I begged my parents to bring me to the theaters to watch episode 3 when it came out. I don\u2019t think there was ever a time that I didn\u2019t know Vader is Luke\u2019s father. It didn\u2019t really matter to me and the fact is so ingrained in pop culture that it\u2019s just one of those things that everyone knows even if they don\u2019t watch Star Wars. Star Wars has grown way past that plot twist.",

When we discovered we both liked Star Wars, we bonded instantly. Problem was I had only seen episode 1, he had only seen the OT. He starts talking about Luke Skywalker and I smugly corrected him \"it's Anakin\", he then retorts with \"Luke is his Son\" and proceeds to explain the history. That conversation was how I discovered there were more movies",

Maybe if you very specifically don't know there are 8 films after you could see it that way. Although if you've not picked up on the menacing nature of the clones and palpatine from the ending of 2 you've probably got other problems. \n\nAnd with regards to a movie where the bad guys essentially win at the end, maybe.... Empire? You know. The film with probably the most famous plot twist in entertainment history? \n\nAlso why would someone having twins be a plot twist? Luke and leia *being* twins IS the plot twist.....",

Unfortunately, he botched it so badly that hardly anybody even notices it's supposed to be a \"surprise\".",

To be honest, there aren't many people alive who don't live under a rock that don't know Vader is Luke's father, and realistically that's the only plot twist in the entire franchise. I think it fits way better that was because you're not having to explain things in the OT that will eventually be explained in the prequels.",

It is an interesting perspective to know I'll never have, especially since I like Episode I a lot so I tend to have a blind spot for its many shortcomings, but the idea that it does little to nothing to really compel viewers to feel invested in the story is fascinating, while just watching the OT is enough to want to go back and watch it.",

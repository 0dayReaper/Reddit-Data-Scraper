The Empire struggles regardless, lacking Vader as a comically dangerous pilot and combatant. (Though possibly getting back together with Maul, once Maul is back together with himself.) \n\nAnd ghost Anakin can hang out with Obi-Wan in exile. Possibly not splitting up the kids? No huge reason to, at that point. The question is whether comically-dangerous twins Luke and Leia grow up as prince and princess, or dirt farmers. The latter is definitely funnier. And those high-powered teenagers are gonna be ready to fuck up some Stormtroopers to save Owen and B-- \n\nWait. The opening fight of A New Hope wouldn't happen. Leia wouldn't be part of Alderaan's \"diplomatic\" envoy. Holy shit they might not know about the Death Star! Obi-Wan and company wouldn't be running off when Han fries Greedo, except through narrative contrivance. They'd all be on Tatooine when Obi-Wan feels a planet explode. \n\nThe Rebellion would have to defeat the Death Star the hard way.",

From my memory Yoda and Palpatine are just talking shit to each other on a video call and Palpatine is basically like \"All right then come down here and face me coward!\" and Yoda says, and I quote, \"Coming to see you, I am now.\" and Palpatine is just utterly gobsmacked as he looks up to see the Death Star hurdling towards him. Also Yoda had to definitely kill what must have been tens of thousands of civilians because of it.\nThose infinities comics were fun but each issue was a stand alone story so it was disappointing that you would never see a continuation of any of the endings of the comics.",

Leia and Luke are raised as Vader's children, Imperial nobility. When the twins are teenagers, Vader finally decides to kill Palpatine and become Emperor, however Palpatine has prepared for this and defeats Vader, but doesn't kill him, just leaves him badly wounded and disfigured.  \n\nVader had taken precautions for the possibility of losing, and some of his most faithful in the 501st take Luke and Leia to a safe place.\nAround a year later, the rest of the 501st, who are fugitives for having helped Vader in his attempt against Palpatine, are killed one by one by a mysterious dark figure, clearly a force user but nobody knows who it is.  \n\nLuke and Leia end up on Dagobah, where their protectors have been able to track down Yoda and decide he's their best chance for survival. Yoda trains Luke and Leia who, by order of the Emperor, had not been allowed to learn the Force.  \n\nThe mysterious dark figure arrives on Dagobah, of course it's Darth Vader, only this time he can't speak and he's a complete slave to Palpatine's will. See, Anakin's brain was damaged, and the cybernetic components used to save him, override his own will. Anakin is pretty much trapped inside his mind as his body is there on Dagobah to kill his children.  \n\nYoda sacrifices himself trying to protect the twins, but kind of fails. Leia is taken down, presumed killed. Luke is badly injured. At this point Palpatine tells Anakin he has no more use for him, and remotely executes him. Imperial forces take the wounded Luke with them, to be Palpatine's new apprentice. Spoiler, he's going to become Darth Scion.  \n\nExcept, Yoda didn't completely fail. In the fight he used the Force to knock Leia out and then make it seem like she had died, masking all her vital signs. Now that the imperial forces have left with Luke, Leia comes to and finds the dying Yoda, he tells her she's her brother's, and the galaxy's, only hope, before vanishing. Spoiler, Leia is going to become a space pirate queen in her quest for revenge.",

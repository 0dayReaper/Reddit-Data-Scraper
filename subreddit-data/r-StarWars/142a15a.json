            "comment": "My buddy is making me a set. He first made me the helmet, but that thing is just too small for my head (I guess I have a rather large dome) and there was like a a solid 2\u201d of my chin still showing when I had the helmet on as far as I could go with my crown touching the top\u2026and I even have a no-guard buzz cut all the time. So, he printed a new one at 110% and hopefully that one will fit., but the thing looks fucking HUGE. Like a s Spartan helmet from the pic he sent me of him wearing it. He\u2019s in CA and I\u2019m in VA, so I can\u2019t just go and try it on whenever. He said the armor files were made for a person 5\u201910-6\u2019, and I\u2019m 5\u201911, so that should be easy enough to work first try. \n\nQuestion. Which spray paint did you use, and how what did you use for the visor portion and how\u2019d you secure it?\n\nMy buddy just used 2 little strips of command strip stuff to place it in, but it\u2019s rather flimsy and it\u2019s not fully flush onto the cheek portions of the helmet.",

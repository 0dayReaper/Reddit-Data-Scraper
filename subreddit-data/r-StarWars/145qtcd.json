He wore a Jedi robe over what we find out in the prequels is the style of the early jedi (but in black) with the overlapping \"vest\" panels. When he goes to Endor he is working as a Rebel. Some Rebels, like Han wear their civilian clothes, while Luke wore the tan uniform in ESB, here he is wearing \"civvies.\"\n\nI also have found his minimalist black outfit when he goes to confront The Sith significant because rather than a nod to samurai, it looks more like a ninja, who were assassins and he is going to assassinate the head of state.\n\nThanks for giving me something to think about.\n\n(Last note, in TLJ, Luke is wearing the vest/loincloth garb as his last act as a Jedi in that parallel universe)",

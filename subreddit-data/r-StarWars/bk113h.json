I'll keep trying - maybe one day it'll get me the same way it gets you all. \n\n\nPeter's passing hurts me in a similar way to Verne's. Great, genuine people of great fame and renown - posting kind and gentle things on reddit without promotional intentions. Truly wanting to spread happiness and kindness to us. \n\n\nLet Peter truly rest in peace, and let us all be reminded of how truly grateful we all are for his contribution and inspiration. May God bless Peter Mayhew and guide him to the Great Place where he belongs to be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n^^EDIT ^^-- ^^Restructured ^^comment.",

I feel like it's still kind of a callous, dismissive quote in some contexts, and was probably even intended as such when Yoda says it to Anakin in the context of the movie. It's one thing not to be saddled by mourning and grief, but to just abscond from them entirely because they're \"greedy\" always seems like kind of a harsh thing to say under the circumstances.",

I was young but the images and sounds have been with me my entire life. The imposing Vader and the Wookies Roar ever present in my heart and mind and a constant in my 41 years of life. What we don't talk about enough are how actors in full costume like Chewy,  C3p0, and R2 conveyed genuine emotion in the characters they inhabited. \n\nChewy felt like my friend, and we knew Chewy was a good guy because of the good guy in the suit. No matter what ups and downs i had in life i could look at a picture of Chewbacca and feel safe and at home again. My grandparents and parents have been gone for a while now. My heros are passing on more and more as well. Its the way of things. But i will be forever grateful for the magic i had when i was young because of them.\n\nRest well Peter Mayhew.",

            "comment": "I just met him at Star Wars Celebration a few weeks ago, this is so surreal. He was in a lot of pain and it was very obvious. He canceled the first day due to exhaustion, and the next day he did come out and sign for everyone. He wanted to call it quits a couple times while I was in line because he was hurting so much but he stuck it out and I'm pretty sure he signed for everyone. At the time I just felt awful that he was in so much pain and having to sit there and sign, but I'm really glad I got the chance to meet him now. I know he loved the fans and I wish he felt better so he could fully enjoy his last Star Wars Celebration. Rest in peace, thank you for everything you've done!",

Which con is closest to you from my list? We'll make front page! Cheers, Peter Mayhew\" \n\nUnfortunately, that never came to be. Now it never will and I feel so devastated. \n\nOh, Mr. Mayhew, you were such a truly kind person with constant love and appreciation for your fans. When we lost Carrie, though you were losing a true friend, you came to this sub to remind us that we were all grieving together. You shared pictures you found from your time on set together to share with us. \n\nYou were so much more than the actor behind a beloved character. You loved sharing your joy of the series with us from both perspectives; As the man that brought Chewy to life and as a fan that loved it all with us. \n\nSo genuine. So kind. I WILL NEVER cease to miss your comments, with your always friendly *Cheers, Peter Mayhew* \nsign off. \n\nGod speed, sir. **Punch it, Chewy**",

Same thing happens that bridges how we go from where we last see maul to S7 maul becoming the son of dathomir comic.",

Those episodes honestly felt so pointless. \n\nI get that Disney probably only let them have quite a limited amount due to budget issues, but 4 episodes that maybe tie up other loose ends like Boba v Cad and stuff would've been great. \n\nFiloni *did* promise to somewhat 'finish' the unfinished episodes - with something called - 'Clone Wars: Legacy'. But after Disney let him make his own live action show, he probably couldn't care any less about finishing the arcs and wanted to pursue a whole show about Ahsoka. I can't blame him, lol.",

And Book of Boba which probably was also in pre-production at the time.\n\nI guess that and maybe Filoni not being interested in making a fully-fledged season and instead just wanting to focus on bridging the gap between the show and Rebels with Ahsoka and Rex's stories. And as the other guy said also - while placing in pilots to gauge popularity for a new animated show around the timeline.",

Which is why the OT trio got the treatment they did to set up Rey and others to be the be the face of star wars. But the sequels did so badly that Disney had to reconsider. I dont know if it was before or after the clone wars finale but Disney went from barely acknowledging the prequel characters to all the prequels based content weve been getting lately (tales of the jedi, bad batch, the ashoka show etc)",

But due to the higher ratings of the bad batch arc and how it would further neatly tie in the general theme of cloning in star wars, The Lucasfilm story group and Kennedy suggested Filoni to take the other route. It makes sense, I mean, he somehow got the sisters to appear in a bad batch episode, he apparantly really likes them, lol.",

But they haven\u2019t been given a chance to change on screen. I imagine sentiment about them would change if they were given that chance. We see some of that potential in the Bad Batch where Rafa is not being entirely selfish like she had been in their Clone Wars arc, but she still has her attitude. \n\nFor the record, I think the Martez sisters\u2019 arc only served to shuttle Ahsoka to the Siege of Mandalore, and the sisters should have been abandoned. The arc should have been replaced with Asajj Ventress or the unfinished kyber crystal heist, or another Ahsoka tale to get her to Mandalore.",

Grab the kids from the family when they\u2019re young which disturbs their ability to form emotional connections. They\u2019re at the age where they\u2019re becoming self aware but are still easily conditioned and manipulated, especially when it comes to their beliefs and ambitions. The spartans would train them to death and ration their food in such small portions they would have to learn how to fight and steal each others food to live. Only the strongest survive. Now the mantra maybe different but the idea and goals are the same, create warriors who wont allow their emotions to get in the way of their mission. And it does make produce some legendary warriors. The problem is separating kids from their families at a young age and encouraging them not to form emotional connections is also a recipe for sociopaths.",

Or I wish it had been made a little bit more interesting and they followed through more.\n\nGiven that she never shows up in other projects, it was immediately obvious the character had an isolated storyline that didn't have much impact outside of the clone wars, and it made me enjoy her arcs less. I felt less invested or curious to know what she would do or where she would end up. \n\nWhen I learned about her comic storyline with Quinlan Vos, it made me both way more interested in her, and disappointed we didn't get to see an on-screen resolution to her character (and more exploration of Vos we never really got outside a few CW episodes). Cause that was a pretty dope storyline. Given that storylines conclusion though, I don't expect we'll ever see much more of her and that's again, really disappointing. \nMade me feel like she was just a plot device that was cast aside for better storylines, just like poor Maul by Sidious..",

See: Boba Fett, Darth Maul, etc.  \nShe benefits from too much plot armor, she's so narrow minded that she comes off as idiotically childish, her backstory is riddled with contradictions, and ultimately she feels more like a 1D caricature than a 3D character.\n\nIf she does appear in live action, I imagine she'll be less leapy, and will probably have that Cad Bane annoying quality of being played by one person and voiced by her toon VA, giving her a very fake feeling.",

            "comment": "I love her and ahsoka\u2019s like \u201cmirror image\u201d relationship (or some term like that) as characters. Both raised by a cult that they were eventually betrayed by, and then once betrayed they saw the flaws in that cult and would not be willing to come back even if invited. Also dual wield. Ahsoka showing up later with two white sabers, I wanted asajj to show up in rebels era stuff or later dual wielding black sabers to continue their \u201cmirror image\u201d stuff. (I\u2019m aware of dark disciple info, but im just imagining).",

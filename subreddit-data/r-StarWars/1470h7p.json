I don't mind her being female but I'd like to be able to mix up the game and if it's open world with starwars then letting me choose sex, race voice, clothes makes it 10x better. And it's ubisoft so we know we ain't getting Red Dead levels here \ud83d\ude02 if they're so big going for this (first open world starwars, which it isnt) then we should be able to make our character.",

Just go forward or backward in time, I don't really care. But as interesting as the trailer for this game might look, I just can't find it within me to give a shit about this time period anymore. Can't wait for yet another piece of media about helping Rebels resist the all-seeing rule of the Empire, certainly haven't seen that one before.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nSo with Ashoka on the horizon and learning that it picks up right where Rebels left off I\u2019m realizing that I really need to dive into this show. I\u2019ve tried to start it several times but I just can\u2019t stay engaged with it. \n\nI\u2019ve watched Clone Wars in its entirety and all of the other shows and movies multiple times. \n\nSo what are your favorite SW Rebels episodes that you would recommend to someone who it\u2019s trying to get into it? I fully trust the hype behind it and I know there\u2019s something there, it just hasn\u2019t clicked for me yet.\n\nFor reference I love the grittier storylines in the SW universe. \ni.e. General Krell CW arc, CW final season, Rogue One, Andor,",

            "comment": "It\u2019ll be easier for me to say which ones aren\u2019t 100% essential. Since most of the show is episodic some episodes have payoffs later. It here\u2019s what I think can be skipped. It\u2019s really only the first third that\u2019s rough. It really picks up towards the end of S2\n\nS1\n\n* Breaking Ranks - there\u2019s someone introduced who becomes a big role in S4 but not enough to suggest\n\n* Idoits Array - this is really the only one I call filler\n\n* Vision of Hope\n\nS2\n\n* Brothers of the Broken Horn - I mean this reintroduced Hondo, but for the whole story nothing that important happened\n\n* Wings of the Master - some development for Hera\n\n* Blood Sisters - some dev for Sabine\n\n* Legends of Lasat - some dev for Zeb and part of the epilogue\n\n* Homecoming - some dev for Hera and her father\n\n* The Mystery of Chopper Base \n\nS3\n\n* Iron Squadron\n\n* The Wynkahthu Job - pretty much the sequel to the Hondo episode \n\n* Double Agent Droid - you will miss Hera going berserk at the end",

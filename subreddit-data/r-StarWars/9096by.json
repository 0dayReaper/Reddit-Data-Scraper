With the Siege of Mandalore we only know the outcome from the Ajsoka novel, they have a lot more room to work with because by the time the novel goes into this Anakin has already left to save Palpatine and order 66 happens. That said, they could probably adapt how Maul escaped Palpatine and the whole arc after in about 3 episodes and then focus on Anakin, Obi and Ahsoka on Mandalore. ",

The influx of Clone Wars merch and content being announced these past couple of months make a lot more sense now. \n\nI really hope this isn\u2019t going to be just a few episodes, but actual full seasons. Also I wonder what this means for SW: Resistance. ",

So assuming all four from the former and about four from the latter, Utapau/Crystal arc would be the most likely conclusion to make up the rest of the 12 episode count. Of course, they mention Fives in the trailer (though I think that section is re-used lines), so if you read into that I could be wrong.",

The ships have artificial gravity, but most of the settled planets are earth-like with near-earth gravity and a breathable atmosphere.\n\nIt's acceptable if you think about it. We wouldn't settle on a planet that didn't have a breathable atmosphere and comfortable level of gravity.",

Wether it\u2019s inside a space slug or a barren desert/tundra, it\u2019s all going to be the same.",

He even got Force hallucinations induced by his Death Stick addiction where he saw Mara Jade, Luke's wife and Cade's great-great-grandmother. He clearly never met either of them and yet the Force still showed both to him, one as a proper ghost and the other as a hallucination.",

Reddit basically slapped on a massive cost to use the API that the apps are using, so Reddit is basically forcing their hands and having them stop development, or pay a huge price. It's scummy, and Reddit's UI design is terrible, so many users are going to just flat out stop using it as they'd rather not use it than use the official app. Hence the \"Reddit is dying in a few weeks\".",

The best experience just comes from working on set. If you don\u2019t wanna go to college / can\u2019t spend the money on a degree, you can always ask your local college\u2019s film program if they need any help on set. We used to volunteer on AFI (American film institute) master program projects when we were younger!",

They went to the same acting school when they were young, became friends, and were in a same film together, *Shattered Glass* (2003). *On the film, Dawson and Christensen didn\u2019t really get to share much screen time. However, it\u2019s safe to say that the two enjoyed catching up with each other on the set.*\n\nThere is also a very cute picture of them hugging and this is how Dave Filoni reacted to that picture: *\u201cI have to say, for Dave, going online and looking up things \u2014 when he came across a photo of the two of us hugging each other, he lost it,\u201d Dawson told StarWars.com. \u201cHe said, \u2018How is this\u2026? This was meant to be.\u2019\u201d*\n\nI mean, this is just super awesome when you think about it. :)",

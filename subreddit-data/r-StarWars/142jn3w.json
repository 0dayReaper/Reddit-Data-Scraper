In the look and feel of the machines, the home-built junkyard podracer scenes succeed where the Vespa scooter kids fail. It gives the folks on Tatooine something to do on a major holiday, and it's undoubtedly as corrupt as a two-sun day is long with Hutt-managed gambling, extortionist pricing on concessions, and jacked-up hotel accommodations. Everything about it makes sense given what we know about life on the frontier.",

The worldbuilding it does with all the side stuff happening during the race is incredible. To me, one of the greater Star Wars moments was the Tusken Raiders fucking with the race by shooting at the racers.  Such a great and appropriate blending of older characters with new elements.  Additionally, all the shots of things like concession/souvenir vendors, the racers dealing with their pit teams, Jabba knocking the little creature off the edge of his balcony out of boredom, etc.  It really gave so much more depth to life on Tatooine.  And all the while, one of the better action sequences in the films is moving along.  \n\nEven little Ani just looks like a badass in the whole event!",

Far, far longer than needed to advance the plot or reveal Anakin\u2019s character/abilities. Almost gratuitous. \n\nI walked out of the theater 5/20/99 and said it felt like Lucas was designing his new Star Wars ride. The scene felt like the old 3D rides (Star Tours, that Michael Jackson one) that were very big in the mid 90s. It seemed like Lucas had just pre-shot the ride footage for Disney to use (I think Star Tours was a Disney at the time). \n\nIt created too much dead time in the middle of the movie. Main plot stopped advancing, let\u2019s just watch CGI landscape fly by. Considering how political that movie was (and that trilogy as a whole) the minutes could have been spent in plot development or better exposition. \n\nBut, yeah, as a concept it was fine.",

How would the events have changed if she did tell them? She could have prevented the entire fall!",

Maul said Sidious had been grooming Anakin for a while, and Palpatine had been such a close confidant for Anakin for several years. Knowing Palpatine\u2019s end goal would\u2019ve given Windu an edge, and he would\u2019ve approached that whole situation differently.",

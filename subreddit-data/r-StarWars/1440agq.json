    "postText": "When I heard about this show I was excited, and while I\u2019m still looking forwards too it and think it\u2019ll do fine, I can\u2019t help being a bit disappointed. \n\nThe more I hear and see from this show, the more it seems less like the Ahsoka show and more like season 5 of Rebels in live action. I want a show about the former apprentice of the chosen one, a veteran of the clone wars who experienced what was wrong with the Jedi order and tried to find her own path. The warrior who fought multiple sith and lived, spymaster for the rebellion who discovered her mentor had become a monster. At the time of the Mandalorian she\u2019s arguably the most powerful individual in the galaxy, with Luke probably being stronger with the force but nowhere near as good or experienced a combatant, and Palpatine presumably being a clump of evil cells in a test tube on Exogal. \n\nThey\u2019ve had to bend reality twice now to keep her around, being resurrected by the embodiment of the light side of the force and then guided by her in spirit-owl form, and introducing time travel to save her the second time. It just seems like a bit of a letdown if the character who\u2019s gone through all that ends up with her own show and the only purpose is to help Sabine and Ezra hookup and fight an Imperial who\u2019s been a non-threat off in the unknown regions for years. \n\nObviously there seems to be a bit more to it than that from the trailers, but the Rebels plot continuation seems to be the big focus. Am I the only one feeling this way?",

            "comment": "I never considered Ahsoka to be a continuation of the Rebels plot. I\u2019d say the roughly 10 years of time between Ahsoka and Rebels is enough for the two stories to be detached. Finding Ezra again is only going to be a small part of the plot, and if I were to guess probably something that they succeed with by the end of the first season. \n\nI think the main point of Ahsoka is to explore the relationship between The Empire and First Order and explaining how the First Order was able to just show up and chill with no one really bothering them for a while. The destruction of Hosnian Prime in TFA was the *beginning* of their war with the Resistance after all",

It's only natural that Rebels characters will be featured as that show ended as pretty much a cliffhanger. In the Dave-written/directed episodes of Mando, we've had great character moments and emotion and I'm confident that we'll be seeing more of that in Ahsoka.",

            "comment": "Im not even a little worried, they are gonna continue the Rebels characters story only (imo) as it applies to finding Ezra (and Thrawn) which includes Ahsoka and maybe more in potential subsequent seasons or shows by showing the build up of FO and possibly The Grysk. Rebels characters being the focus of the trailer seems to imply thats whats going on in the first few episodes (trailers typically do this). After that I expect mystical force shit centered around Ahsoka, it might not be what you want it to be but I dont think anyone will be disappointed other than gatekeepers.",

The clone wars really fleshes out the conflict, characters and Vaders fall to the darkside.\n\nRebels is great, even more so in context with Andor. Also there are links/easter eggs in the Mandolorian, and there appears to be a direct link to the upcoming Ashoka series.\n\nNot to mention Visions, tales of the jedi....\n\nYou are in for hours and hours of a real treat.\n\nedit - typo fixing",

He truly believed he could wield the dark side without succumbing to it and use it for good. He even believed, at one point, that Palpatine supported him and the Seperatist movement. Dooku is the perfect example of how the dark side corrupts even those with the noblest of intentions. He truly did want Obi-Wan to join him, however possibly not to destroy the Sith, but take them over. Perhaps, in a way, he believed if he killed Sidious and ended the Sith religion he could still accomplish his goals and have nobody standing in his way. He believed his intentions were noble enough to justify his actions, when in reality his actions were fueled by the corruption of the dark side. He ended up falling into the same pattern of every Sith before him, wanting to kill his master and replace him, even if he did believe it was for a good reason.",

But I think no, he was just trying to deceive ObI Wan to work with him in order to convert him to the dark side so together they both could overthrow Darth Sidious (the Emporer).  As Dooku knew he wasn\u2019t powerful enough on his own to kill Sidious. Just my guess.",

    "postText": "Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control. \n\nFurthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's entirely possible that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies.  \n\nAnd finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to why I believe it is not only possible, but *plausible* that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo first, let's **establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior.**  While this does not in itself necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, it's highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe-- very rarely do we see \"normal\" characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives.\n\nSo here's [Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault](http://gfycat.com/ThirstyEverlastingAmericanbittern).\n\nNow, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi.  *In* the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane dialogue and cowardly-lion act.\n\nHe also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though he's *always* incredibly, amazingly successful.  Whether single-handedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb \"luck.\"  \n\nBut is it? [Obi-Wan warned us otherwise.](http://i.imgur.com/Y233Zgb.png)\n\nThis is one of the main reasons we as an audience hate Jar Jar so thoroughly;  he breaks the fourth wall, he he shatters our suspension of disbelief, because we know that no one is *really* that lucky.  We dismiss it as a lame, cliched trope-- the silly pathetic oaf who always seems to inadvertently save the day.\n\nI posit that, instead, this is a deliberate facade on the part of Jar Jar as a character, and on the part of the writers and animators.  As we know, the Jedi themselves are inspired by Shaolin Monks, and there's a particular kung fu discipline that Jar Jar's physicality is purposefully modeled upon which allows him to appear goofy and uncoordinated even as he lays waste to his enemies; namely, [Zui Quan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zui_quan), or Drunken Fist wushu.  This discipline seeks to imitate the \"sloshing,\" seemingly random foibles of a drunkard, but in reality the staggering and stumbling is the use of bodily momentum, deception, and unpredictability intended to lure and confuse opponents.\n\nLet's take a look at Jar Jar displaying some wushu (the compasion clips are taken from [an instructional Zui Quan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU9-3J9CQwE)):\n\n[Jar Jar kipping-up](http://gfycat.com/IdealisticFragrantHyena)\n\n[Zui Quan Comparison](http://gfycat.com/FamousLegitimateDartfrog#)\n\n[Jar Jar \"sloshing\"](http://gfycat.com/AcrobaticFaroffBeauceron#)\n\n[Zui Quan Comparison](http://gfycat.com/PettyUnlinedIberianmidwifetoad#?speed=2)\n\n[Jar Jar Sweeps the Leg](http://gfycat.com/EnormousColorfulIbisbill#)\n\n[Zui Quan Comparison](http://gfycat.com/LimpDisgustingGiantschnauzer)\n\n(if you [slow down the above gif](http://gfycat.com/EnormousColorfulIbisbill#?speed=0.125), you'll notice how Jar Jar *dodges* an incoming blaster shot at the very beginning. You'll also notice how he's mysteriously aware of the droideka as it appears behind him, even though it isn't in his line of sight and he couldn't possibly hear it over the din of battle....)\n\n[Jar Jar Centering himself in preparation for a Force jump](http://gfycat.com/LimpBewitchedBaiji#?speed=0.25)\n\n[Zui Quan Comparison](http://gfycat.com/DistantAptGangesdolphin)\n\n...ok, that's all well and good, but even *if* Jar Jar is a secret Drunken Fist boxing master, that doesn't make him a force user, right?  Well, it should at least make us suspicious of his character period.  It establishes that his over-the-top, childish antics are a veneer masking a more complex character than we're led to believe.  But even if you choose to ignore Jar Jar's seemingly magical prescience in battle, I believe that there is a particular scene in which we do see him *clearly* make use of the physical force...\n\nIn TPM, when Jar Jar and the Jedi ambush the droids and rescue the queen and her entourage, Jar Jar \"accidentally\" botches his leap from the balcony.  A few frames later, he is seen dropping from the *opposite* side of the balcony, which would seem to be quite be impossible without a force assisted jump and/or force sprint of some kind.  Let's take a look at the full scene:\n\n[Jar Jar Ambush](http://gfycat.com/PrestigiousDefensiveBordercollie)\n\n(Note that as they sneak up, Jar Jar is just as effortlessly stealthy as his Jedi counterparts.  Interesting.)\n\nNow as I said, we see Jar Jar catch hold of the balcony on the far right side, but then he drops to the ground on the far left.  Easy to dismiss as a continuity or framing error, I suppose... except that one of the droids continues to fire on Jar Jar's initial position, even as we see him drop elsewhere!\n\n[Here it is in slow-motion](http://gfycat.com/LinearAgreeableArachnid#?speed=0.5)\n\nSee the droid that comes charging up, right behind the one Qui-Gon chops down?  What's he shooting at up there??  And see its head swing back towards Jar Jars new position after the shot? You can also see another droid behind it tracking Jar Jar with its head, and manage a shot on the new position.  This means that the animators knew very well where Jar Jar was *supposed* to be- dangling from the balcony over Qui-Gon's left shoulder- and purposefully animate the droids tracking his inexplicably fast movement elsewhere.\n\nI think what has happened here, even though we don't see it directly, is that Jar Jar has purposefully split the attention of the enemies by grabbing on to the balcony as he falls, and then (using the force) propelled himself with a pull-up/flip to land in an unexpected place.\n\nIn fact, [this is a maneuver we've seen before](http://gfycat.com/ChiefForcefulJellyfish)... from a jedi.  Twice, if you want to count Obi-Wan doing it in the Duel of Fates to take Maul by surprise.\n\nIn addition to this kind of highly suspicious physical \"luck,\" I also believe that we're given enough clues to justifiably suspect that **Jar Jar is also a master of Jedi Mind Control.**\n\nConsider: We hate the way Jar Jar influences major plot points for the same reason we hate his physicality- *it messes with our sense of realism*.  Two experienced Jedi on a serious mission would never *actually* bring someone that stupid along with them.  No character that idiotic would ever *really* be made a general.  They certainly wouldn't be made a senator.  How could anyone like Jar Jar really convince the entire galaxy to abandon democracy? That's ridiculous.  \n\nThese things are just the political version of his physical \"luck.\"  Inadvertent, seemingly comical bumbling that *just so happens* to result in astoundingly positive results.  But what if it isn't inadvertant, and what if Jar Jar's meteoric rise and inexplicable influence isn't the result of dumb happenstance, but the result of extensive and careful use of force mind powers?\n\nJedi (and presumably Sith) exhibit telltale signs when using the Mind Trick to implant suggestions or influence behavior.  For one, [they always gesticulate](http://gfycat.com/InferiorPoliteIsopod) and [not-so-subtly wave their hands at the target.](http://gfycat.com/DarlingWellgroomedIchthyostega) \n\nHere's a look at some pivotal Jar Jar moments during his political career:\n\n[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to Bombad General]\n(http://gfycat.com/ChillyWideAardwolf)\n\n[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to the Senate]\n(http://gfycat.com/LameImmaterialEwe)\n\n[Jar Jar using Force Persuasion as he hand-waves the entire Galactic Senate](http://gfycat.com/CheerfulHugeDutchsmoushond) and ushers in the death of democracy.\n\nActually, if you watch the prequels with the idea that Jar Jar might be a manipulative, dark character, you begin to notice just how insidious and subtle his manipulation is, and how effective, in almost every sequence he's involved in, and also just how hyper-aware of the overarching plot he really is.  \n\nExamples: Jar Jar tricking the Jedi into traveling through the planet core (so that they need him).  Jar Jar carefully causing a scene so that they run into Anakin.  Jar Jar constantly mocking Qui-Gon behind his back while Anakin is watching (so that Anakin learns disrespect for Jedi authority early on).  Jar Jar telling an 8 year old child that the queen is \"pretty hot,\"  fanning the flames of the child's infatuation that is exploited later on.  I could go on.  \n\nNow if you lend even the slightest credence to my above points, and acknowledge the possibility that Jar Jar might *not* be an idiot, you're almost forced to conclude that **Jar Jar Binks and Palpatine were co-conspirators.**  If Jar Jar is putting forth an elaborate act to deceive people, it means he's not a fool... and if he's not a fool, it means his actions in Episode II that facilitate Palpatine's plans are not those of an unwitting tool- they are those of a *partner.* \n\nRemember- Palpatine and Jar Jar are from the same planet, which in the scale of the Star Wars universe is like growing up as next door neighbors.  It's entirely possible that they knew each other for years prior to TPM-- perhaps they trained together, or one trained the other.  And Naboo is a really strange planet, actually; remember those [odd ancient statues](http://i.imgur.com/yXgDgaF.jpg) with the third eye?  Naboo is the kind of place an \"outcast\" Gungan might find a Sith holocron or two.  \n\nBut that's just speculation.  Let's stick to what we know-- what we know is that even after Palpatine is elected as Chancellor, *years* after Jar Jar has been \"tricked\" into helping elect him, [Palpatine *still* hangs out with Jar Jar in RotS.](http://i.imgur.com/Ues6Llm.jpg).  Why?  Wouldn't he be a constant source of public embarrassment?  This is the same character who can't walk five yards without stepping in poodoo or squealing like a rabid donkey, right?  What use does he have now?   Why is he still at the right hand of the most powerful person in the galaxy?   Could it be that in fact Jar Jar ***is*** the most powerful person in the galaxy?\n\nFine.  Maybe.  Hilarious conspiracy theory, but why would George Lucas bother to create this devious Gungan character with an elaborate conspiratorial past, but then never actually reveal his true nature?\n\nHere's George Lucas (from a documentary) talking about Yoda:\n\n\"Yoda really comes from a tradition in mythological storytelling- fairy tales- of the hero finding a little creature on the side of the road **that seems very insignificant and not very important**, but who turns out to be the master wizard, or the master thing...\"\n\nAs we all know, one of Lucas' big deals with the prequels was that they were intended to \"rhyme\" and mirror the original trilogy in terms of general narrative themes.  So there *should* have been a seemingly innocent creature found on the side of the road that later reveals itself as a major player.  We *do* have a creature that this seems to describe precisely... Jar Jar... but of course he never develops into a \"master\" anything.\n\nHere's what I think happened:  I think that Jar Jar was initially intended to be the prequel (and Dark Side) equivalent of Yoda.  Just as Yoda has his \"big reveal\" when we learn that his tottering, geriatric goofball persona is just a mask, Jar Jar was intended to have a big reveal in Episode II or III where we learn that he's not really a naive dope, but rather a master puppeteer Sith in league with (or perhaps in charge of) Palpatine. \n\nHowever, GL chickened out.  The fan reaction to Jar Jar was so vitriolic that this aspect of the trilogy was abandoned.  Just too risky... if Jar Jar is truly that off-putting, it's potentially ruinous to the Star Wars legacy to imply that he's the ultimate bad guy of the *entire saga*.  So pretend he was just a failed attempt at comic relief instead.  \n\nThis is why Dooku seems like such a flat, shoehorned-in character with no backstory; he was hastily written in to cover the plot holes left when villain Jar Jar was redacted.  Yoda was meant to duel with his literal darkside nemesis and mythological equivalent at the end of AotC: not boring old Count Dooku, but *Sith Master Jar Jar*.  And Binks was meant to escape, not just that duel but to survive the entire trilogy... so that he could cast a shadow on the OT, too; you'd rewatch the originals knowing that the Emperor wasn't necessarily the big baddie after all... Jar Jar is still out there somewhere.  It would have been sort of brilliant.\n\n***But*** I believe it is likely that the writers of the new trilogy will resurrect this idea.  Most people seem to think that Disney wishes to distance or somehow disassociate itself from the prequels... but this doesn't actually make any economic or marketing sense.  There is far more prequel-era based intellectual property to capitalize on than there is OT, if only because of the Clone Wars movie and series.  Billions of dollars in iconic toys, images, characters, games, park rides, etc that an entire younger generation grew up on.  Disney is not going to pretend that *over half* of the $4 billion in IP they bought simply isn't worth acknowledging.  \n\n(and anyway, we have [behind the scenes TFA footage](http://i.imgur.com/SZwUBjd.jpg) clearly showing imagery being reused from the prequels.  Also, many of the flags above Maz's castle in the trailer are from TPM)\n\nNo, it stands to reason that one of their primary goals will be to reinvigorate and ultimately try to redeem the prequels in the eyes of the fanbase.  To elevate and improve them retroactively, as much as possible.  So how do you do that?\n\nJar Jar Binks has undoubtedly become the face of everything that is \"wrong\" with the prequels- he was too silly, too unbelievable, seemingly pointless.  If you are able to somehow change the nature of Jar Jar from embarrassing idiot to jaw-dropping villain, suddenly the entire prequel trilogy must be seen in a new light, because it becomes the setup for the most astounding reveal in film history:\n\n**Jar Jar Binks is Supreme Leader Snoke!**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It referred to Yoda as Qui-Gon's former master, not specifically in name but it did say that Qui-Gon's master had spent 900 years in the order. Only one character fits that description.\n\nSuddenly, in AotC, Dooku was Yoda's former apprentice and Qui-Gon's former master.",

They point spears at him, and don't act like he's just a bumbling idiot. They seem more worried about him than the two Jedi he's with. Contrast this with the absolute conviction of the federation dudes that the Jedi are a huge potential threat. It is clear soon after that they recognise them as Jedi, so they're not acting from ignorance.\n\nNot long after, when they're on the way to the planet's core, Qui-gon asks Jar Jar why he was banished, and Jar Jar acts very shiftily, saying it was because he was \"clumsy\" and yes, \"you could say that\". He does, though, acknowledge this was \"a small part of it\", while being extremely evasive. The Jedi seem skeptical, but presumably don't think too much more about it. Jar Jar then describes causing great damage.\n\nThey are then attacked by a big fish, who is then eaten by another, bigger fish. Qui-gon comments that \"There's always a bigger fish.\"\n\nThis \"introduction to Jar Jar\" struck me as very strange. It never occurred to me that he might be the big villain of your theory, but damn, it really fits. We're introduced to Jar Jar as feared, dishonest, and with reference to a \"bigger fish\".\n\nIt also seems strange that they have this guardian angel of a giant fish.",

Just as Yoda has his \"big reveal\" when we learn that his tottering, geriatric goofball persona is just a mask, Jar Jar was intended to have a big reveal in Episode II or III where we learn that he's not really a naive dope, but rather a master puppeteer Sith in league with (or perhaps in charge of) Palpatine.\n\n&gt; However, GL chickened out. The fan reaction to Jar Jar was so vitriolic that this aspect of the trilogy was abandoned. Just too risky... if Jar Jar is truly that off-putting, it's potentially ruinous to the Star Wars legacy to imply that he's the ultimate bad guy of the entire saga. So pretend he was just a failed attempt at comic relief instead.\n\nOn the off chance you're right about this, what a damned shame that Lucas chickened out.  Jar Jar being revealed as Evil Yoda in the second movie would've retroactively redeemed so much of TPM... Honestly, even if you're not right, you've written a much better version of the prequels than what we got.",

            "comment": "Thank you for posting this, it's the most enjoyable thing I've read online in months. \n\nI had a few thoughts supporting your theory:\n\n1 - George Lucas did an excellent job of hiding the truth of Vader being Luke's father from people, down to filming the scene one way and then bringing a elect few back to do the scene again. So, if it is as you say and the idea was abandoned partway, it's very plausible the number of people who knew the epic twist would be a scant few. \n\n2- Given the size of Naboo and the fact the droids go only after the Naboo and not the Gungans, it is extremely unlikely Binks would just happen to be at the landing site of any federation ships, much less the ship carrying Qui Gon Gin. He can't sense droids maybe, but I bet Master Qui Gon was a big bright beacon.\n\n3- When Qui Gon sees him, those ships aren't moving fast and all things around are fleeing. Jar Jar makes no attempt to flee, but instead waves his hands and blocks QG's path, then clings to him. Afterward, he follows QG, pledges to be his servant and when told \"that won't be necessary\" replies \"oh, but it is, it's demanded by the gods it is.\"\n\n4- His whole initial dialogue with the two jedi focuses on two points, A, that QG has saved him once, then again, and he owes him and must be his servant. B, the safest place is Gungan City, but Jar Jar will be in great danger and trouble if they go, setting himself up to go with them when they leave. \n\n5- during the dialogue with Boss Nass, they cut to Jar Jar as Nass is talking, and Jar Jar gesticulates in his handcuffs, perhaps steering nass with the force. \n\n6- QG \"overdoes it\" when he uses the force to calm Jar Jar when the third fish shows up. This conveniently gives Jar Jar an excuse to close his eyes and focus on taking control of the nearest bigger fish to come rescue all three of them. He wakes up and clears his head, dramatically shaking it off the very moment the fish 4 takes its first bite of fish 3 and the dnager to them has passed. \n\n7 - Honestly, I half suspected you'd somehow tweaked or altered the balcony scene as part of an elaborate hoax, but having just watched it twice Jar Jar is just as stealthy, then suddenly becomes a clutz in time to present a target and then jump away and land on the opposite side, complete with droid firing high then snapping its head to Jar Jar's position. \n\n8 - On the way up the ramp to the ship during the escape scene, just prior to your hyperdrive sabotage theory moment, Jar Jar gestures, and then is the second person up the ramp following Amidala/her double, with her honor guard in tow. There is now way an un-jedi influenced personal queen's guard is going to let a Gungan they just met, a race that hates Naboo, be between them and their queen, right?\n\n9- The first thing Jar Jar says on Tattooine is, this sun is doing murder to meesa skin. He's aquatic. Why the hell is he going with QG and R2 to the city to find parts? QG seems appalled at the idea of taking Padme, so why is he cool with taking the clumsy/bumbling Jar Jar? Perhaps because Jar Jar contrived to be there. \n\n10 - When Padme is at her most uncertain, it's Jar Jar's mention of the Gungan's grand army that gives her the push to go back to Naboo, and coincidently make Jar Jar critical to her plan, as he is the only Gungan she knows.

            "comment": "Just to add a bit to the theory: Lucas almost always draws on other sources (like any good storyteller) to form his world. So can we find inspiration for the character of Jar Jar Binks in the way that you describe? Absolutely.\n\n1) This has already been mentioned by several others, but if Jar Jar is simply playing the fool as a means to the insidious ends of bringing about the fall of the Republic, destroying the Order of the Jedi, and establishing a galactic empire, then his character would almost mirror that of The Mule from Isaac Asimov's foundation. Powerful telepathic mutant who played the fool but mind controlled and manipulated others to get his way, worked mostly in the background and through politics, and managed to bring about the destruction of the complacent First Foundation on Terminus and establish an empire spanning a third of the galaxy. The correlations are painfully obvious if Jar Jar is, in fact, maliciously manipulative.\n\n2) The name could perhaps provide some clue. Lucas is often not particularly subtle with his naming choices while still not making them seem unnatural. Skywalker, Solo, Darth Vader, etc. So can the very name Jar Jar Binks help solidify this theory? \n\nLet's take them in order. Jar can mean a number of things. From Merriam-Webster.com, \"to have a harsh or unpleasant effect on someone or something\", \"to hit or shake something forcefully\", \"to make someone feel uneasy\". A couple of secondary meanings given are \"an unsettling shock\", \"an unpleasant break or conflict in rhythm, flow, or transition\". \n\nNow for Binks. My best guess is that Lucas was drawing on another already existing source as his inspiration for Binks. The popular fantasy world of Xanth, created by Piers Anthony and with its first book published in 1977. The main character of the first two books and a recurring character through other books in the series is...Bink. Copy/Pasted from Wikipedia, here is Bink's description.\n\n&gt; Bink is the Magician of Magical Invulnerability and the main character in the first two novels of the Xanth series, A Spell for Chameleon and The Source of Magic. He is the son of Roland of the High Council and Bianca. He serves as king pro-tem during Trent's reign.\n\n&gt;Bink is banished for not possessing a magic talent when, in fact, he does possess magical ability. Bink's magic does not want to be known because, if it were, those of non-magical means would injure Bink and his family, with the magic being indirectly responsible. Hence, in order to keep itself hidden, Bink's magic works in quiet ways, by seeming coincidence, and very few people know of it. For example, it causes an invisible giant to walk by just as Bink was to reveal his magic whilst under a truth spell. Furthermore, Bink's magic protects him, making him seem an unusually lucky man.\n\nSo, Jar Jar Binks. With the above information, his name seems like it could actually help inform what George wanted from the character. And based on this information, if Bink is in fact the source for Jar Jar Binks' last name, then it implies a hidden magic user who appears to be just ridiculously lucky but is in fact just keeping his true nature on the down low. And the two Jars are perhaps to tell us that he will cause a dual jarring: one in the Star Wars universe when he destroys the Jedi Order and dismantles the Republic, the other in the movie audience when his true nature is finally revealed.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for my first gold!",

            "comment": "George Lucas has a history with characters turning out to be more then they seem/plot twists:\n\n- Lando's betrayel, and redemption\n- Leia and Luke being siblings\n- Obi Wan's introduction as a mysterious robed krayt dragon-screeching hobo\n- Yoda being introduced as a drunken muppet\n- Darth Vader being Luke's father\n- The Death Star 2 actually being operational\n- Leia as the thermal detonator bounty hunter at the Hutt palace\n- Han being a scumbag who's in it or the money, but later transformed into a rebel general\n- Obi Wans story about Luke's father.\n- Palpatine, Dooku, both assumed the guise of good guys.\n\n\nThe list goes on and on, George Lucas loves these kinds of plot twist.\n\nAfter some thought, I also understand why Palapatine and Jar Jar killed Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon hated Jar Jar from the moment he saw him, and was a way more competent Jedi than Obi Wan. He instinctively fought Jar Jar's whole act. He might have been able to prevent the whole Anakin shitstorm, and thus saved the Jedi order.\n\nDarth Maul was a sort of Kamikaze pilot (We all know George Lucas loves himself some japanese culture, and Darth has the whole samurai scary helmet thing this going on). His mission was to kill Qui-Gon, the whole fight was rigged that way. The walkways and energy walls were the perfect way to seperate the two jedi. After killing Qui-Gon, he sacrificed himself. Losing to a disarmed Obi Wan after fighting 2 jedi at the same time and killing the master isn't something I ever thought was very logical.\n\nThe fight on Tatooine between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul also hints at this. Darth Mauls droids have had ages to locate them, yet Darth Maul only appears when everyone but Qui-Gon and Anakin are on the ship. He was literally waiting on a cliff nearby, when the droid tells him the target is approaching. He completely ignores Anakin, let's him escape and positions himself between Qui-Gon and the ship.\n\nThe sith knew Obi Wan would be granted Anakin, while being way to inexperienced to handle such raw force potential while two sith slowly maniplulated Anakin into being the perfect jedi killing bomb. I mean seriously, Obi Wan was a nice dude, but he was just a dumb warrior. Always just a bit behind the facts, always unpleasantly surprised by the turn of events. Wouldn't you grow resentful of being trained by some doofus who isn't really a jedi master while you're the most powerful dude in the galaxy? \nIt's a really good plan.\n",

It wasn't triggered by anything though. We were just being sarcastic, just amused by the idea. We even threw in a few of the ideas mentioned here, in the loose, i.e the way he seems to be too pivotal for someone so stupid, and present at the major events. But it was just a joke\n\nEven when first reading this, I thought it was going to be a sort of sarcastic piss take, satirising fan theories in general... I'm really dumbfounded that this hasn't been noticed until now, so blinded we were by our hatred of Jar Jar. It's the perfect Sith disguise, it's masterful. \n\nI honestly believe /u/Lumpawarroo has discovered George's original intent. It was staring us in the face; literally, when that droid turns to look at the camera. I wish now, George had maintained true to his original vision. I can see why he may have been terrified of a fan boycott, though.\n\nIn any event, if Abrams was never made aware of this, I hope he sees this, and appreciates the glory of it.",

When they sit down in the car, Jar Jar comments on how nice the Queen is being to them.  Then he pointedly comments, \"Pitty hot!\"\n\nTo me there's no question that he's literally saying that the queen is \"hot,\" as in attractive.  He's not commenting on the weather or anything.  It's a completely nonsensical and inappropriate thing to say to a little kid, and is totally weird in the movie....unless you realize what is actually happening (that Jar Jar is a bad guy manipulating an impressionable Annie)\n\nAlso note that in Attack of the Clones, when they first meet up again, Anakin is forlorn and tells Jar Jar, \"She (Padme) has forgotten me completely.\"\n\nJar Jar is very quick to buoy his hopes, though, telling Anakin, \"No, no she's happy to see you, happier than I've ever seen her!\"\n\nSee, Jar Jar has a vested interest in Anakin's continued lust for Padme.  Because he and Palpatine have already formulated that as the easiest way to undermine Anakin's loyalty to the Jedi.  \n\nThere's *no telling* how much Jar Jar has been deviously encouraging Anakin's infatuation in the formative years between TPM and AotC.  And we must assume that he has been-- why else would Anakin *immediately* start talking to Jar Jar about how the queen has forgotten him?  It's because Jar Jar has become his confidant/wing man in the matter.\n\nI wouldn't doubt that it was Jar Jar, also, who eventually plants the Padme-death-by-childbirth nightmares in Anakin's dreams.  Master of mind control, after all.",

R2-D2 notices that this character is doing something suspicious, and gives him a well-deserved smack, and shakes its head as if to say, \"Uh uh, don't F with my ship, buddy.\"  Unfortunately, R2 is forced to head elsewhere and deal with outer hull damage, allowing Jar Jar to finish his dirty work.\n\nHow wude, indeed.  See, Jar Jar hates droids, and they hate Jar Jar.  They are immune to his Mind Control powers and thus immediately recognize him as a foul threat.  You see this throughout the movie (example: in Watto's shop, awakened Pit Droid immediately kicks Jar Jar in his Jar Jars).",

It's pretty obvious that he's just a non-Jedi wearing Jedi robes by the way he moves, but perhaps he's using his mind powers to influence the Separatists and gain the trust of Padme?  He's also able to go beyond communication with sea animals - he can get them to do things when there is no easily visible benefit to them.",

When he's \"accidentally\" zapped by the power arc and his hand gets stuck in the engine blades?  Padme has to come \"save\" him...\n\nLittle side theory, here: Jar Jar creates moments of feigned vulnerability or victimhood to lure in his most important thralls.  It's when his target let's their mental guard down, trying to help someone else- this is the essence of evil: exploiting the good nature of people.  \n\nHe initially enthralls Qui-Gon when the Jedi \"saves\" him from being run over by the big droid transport.  Note that after this moment, Qui-Gon will do *anything* Jar Jar suggests.  \n\nHe enthralls Obi-Wan when they have to \"save\" him from the water after their bongo falls over the waterfall ([this is a deleted scene\\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxdpNpIAYZg&amp;t=1m21s).  Funny how an aquatic creature who's already shown us that he's a professional acrobat has to be pulled from the water like a drowning victim, huh?\n\nHe enthralls Anakin at the moment he \"saves\" him from Sebulba.  Funny how Jar Jar just happened to spit a dead fish at the one market patron who just happens to be Anakin's rival, huh?  That'll get the boy's attention- which was precisely the goal, of course.\n\n",

So we are meant to believe that he is the village idiot, cruelly exiled. \n\nThis raises questions - are the gungans such a cruel race that they exile all their mentally disabled? They seem fairly peaceable. Why not imprison Jar Jar? Commit him to a home, where he and others will be safe? \n\nInstead they exile him. Why? I don't think what happened was an \"accident\" - it sounds like maybe a power grab went wrong, and they knew he was too strong to be killed or contained. So they made a deal. They wouldn't tell anyone what happened if Jar Jar left them in peace. \n\nIf he were simply the village idiot, so hated for his stupidity, why were the gungans who saw his return so wary of him? They aren't a particularly polite race - why didn't they tell him to GTFO? Simple. They are afraid of him. They let an exiled gungan re-enter without protest. \n\nA security officer comes over to handle it, and instead of just showing the village idiot the door, what does he do? TAKES HIM TO THE LEADER OF THEIR RACE. What? If he truly was a bumbling dork, that would not happen. \n\nDarthDarth Binks. ",

            "comment": "The subtlety of everything here complements something I realized while watch [this fan edit of the prequels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9LEhOZZbuk&amp;feature=youtu.be): Lucas had a lot of great subtle points he buried under a very thick and lumbering story.\n\nThere are two examples that stick out to me from one watchthrough: The Manipulation of Anakin and Obi-Wan and The High Ground.\n\n**The Manipulation of Anakin**  \nIn the original edit, Palpatine's manipulations when it came to turning Anakin to the dark side were not clear.  In fact, my mother's biggest complaint about Episode III was that it took this basically good kid and inexplicably made him evil.\n\nHowever, when I watched that edit I saw the genius of Palpatine's plan.  He knows that the Jedi Council are beginning to distrust him and would like an opportunity to spy on him.  He also knows that his friendship with Anakin would make Anakin an ideal candidate.  So, he plants a seed of distrust for the Council's motives in Anakin's mind.  Then he asks that the Council make Anakin a member.  As Anakin says, nobody has ever been on the council and not given the rank of Jedi Master.  By not promoting Anakin, they water the seed of distrust Palpatine planted by making Anakin angry at the Council and clouding his judgement.  From there, the other seed, that Padme might be made to live, is allowed to take root, but only if Palpatine also survives.\n\nEDIT: Because this wasn't entirely clear, I mean that while Palpatine manipulating Anakin at all was obvious, that him getting Anakin onto the Council was part of the plan was not.  I had thought he had just wanted Anakin on the Council to either get someone he's turning into his guy onto the Council or to just get Anakin more power or legitimacy.  I did not realize that he wanted the Council to refuse to make Anakin a Jedi Master so that Anakin would grow angry with them and believe what Palpatine had said otherwise.\n\nHe also wanted the Council to ask Anakin to spy on him for them.  This would play right into the narrative that Palpatine had created for Anakin, that the Council was looking to overthrow the Chancellor, and make Anakin, who is already angry, even more distrustful of their motives.  The way it played in the original edit, it felt more like a tug of war for Anakin's soul than Palpatine being a chess player and using the Council's predictable reactions against them.  To me at least.\n\nEND EDIT\n\n**Obi-Wan and The High Ground**  \nLucas (in)famously said that the trilogies rhyme like poetry.  One case which is often overlooked is the rhyming of the duels between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul and between Obi-Wan and Anakin.\n\nWhen Obi-Wan faced Darth Maul he found himself dangling at Maul's feet.  He then utilized a Force Jump and Pull to get behind Maul and defeat him.\n\nIn the intervening years he studied this situation and learned of the many defenses one can employ when you're on the high ground.  Perhaps he sensed he would need it, or he just got an interest in the theories behind high ground vs. low ground lightsaber dueling.  Or maybe he didn't study the situation at all.\n\nRegardless, one day he finds himself on Mustafar dueling Anakin.  Only this time, he has the high ground.  He sees the reflection of his situation against Maul and recognizes Anakin's next logical move.  He warns Anakin not to because he knows how to defend against it.  Because it mirrored where it all began for him.",

I still do wonder why Maul just stood, waited and watched as a Jedi jumped over him, grabbed a lightsaber and cut him in half though.\n\nI thought the manipulation of Anakin was all pretty obvious though, mainly achievable due to him being an impatient and impetuous spoilt brat. It's all a bit lightweight and flimsy and doesn't do the character of Darth Vader justice.\n\nI'd kind of imagined something more like, yes the befriending by Palpatine still occurs, and Palpatine feeds him whispers of sith influence on the Galactic Council. The Jedi Council refuse to act and Anakin decides to go it alone and investigate himself, to weed out the Sith threat and earn his place on the Council and as a master. He manages to follow the trail to wherever, and big reveal (to him), Palpatine is Sidious. In a scene mirroring Luke attacking the Emperor in ROTJ, he gives into his hate and attacks (thereby falls to the dark side). He is however bested by Sidious and begs for death, but Sidious takes him captive, tortures him and twists his mind against the Jedi, blaming them for Padme's death (occurred in intervening period due after the kids were born, she started leaving them with the nanny/Jedi/whoever on Coruscant and investigating leads on Anakins disappearance, stumbled onto the planet where he was being held and was murdered by Sidious). Only some time later does Obi Wan manage to follow the trail and find Anakin, apparently alone but filled with hate. Obi Wan frees him but Anakin attacks, believing Obi Wan killed Padme. Obi Wan fights defensively trying to reason with and explain to Anakin, but can't get through. Fight progresses as per Episode III to the High Ground situation, and continues  as per film from there (without the \"Noooooooo\" at the end).",

There could have been more, but I was hitting the 15,000 character limit on the post.\n\nI didn't even show Jar Jar using the force to predict the future:\n\n[Jar Jar the psychic doorman](http://gfycat.com/HoarseAdventurousLadybird)\n\n... how did he know the Jedi were going to arrive precisely then and there?  There was no doorbell.  They didn't call ahead of time or anything- otherwise the Queen herself or her security would have been there to greet the distinguished Jedi- and besides, we know they didn't give advanced notice, because after this scene, Jar Jar has to call out to the Queen and tell her who is there.  And everyone's surprised.\n\nBut not Jar Jar.  He sensed them as they were coming up, just like the Jedi sense the intruder assasin bug later that evening.  \n\nNote how he slyly checks around every corner as he's walkin there, slinking about like it's only natural for him to be sneaky and stuff... but only dials up the \"Gee shucks I'm a goofball!\" routine when the elevator doors open.\n\nI'm telling you, watch the prequels and keep an eye on Jar Jar when the other characters aren't looking directly at him.",

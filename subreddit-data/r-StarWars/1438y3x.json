For example, they capitalize on survival and primal instincts to tap into rage while in a conflict, but go through the rest of the day like a dad who is also a serial killer?\n\nI feel like you could be fairly daunting without being evil. Instead, you let that evil, those intrusive thoughts flow through you while you need them. We hear that the dark side corrupts the user. I\u2019d argue the light does so as well by weakening the subtle nuances of observation and emotion and replacing them with a sense of righteousness, elevated to an ethereal plane. What do you think?",

I don't think they'll inevitably become a mindless murderer but they will do whatever it takes to achieve their own ambitions or fulfill their desires and if causing untold pain to those around them helps them achieve it then they won't hesitate.\n\nI'm not sure where you get the idea that the light side corrupts either. It doesn't dull emotions, a Jedi can still feel anger, fear, pain etc, (Obi wan seemed pretty furious with Anakin when he burned down the jedi temple) they just need make sure they dont act on those feelings and clear their mind when accessing the force.",

This time its just using the force to reach out, \n\nBoth sides use the enhanced reflexes precog to use the lightsaber to be murder blenders against enemies, but the red ones are the bad guys.\n\nI suppose my point is, does it really matter how they use powers rather than why?",

An animal that kills another animal to end the hunger in its stomach or feed its babies isn\u2019t falling to the dark side, what they\u2019re doing is just part of the natural order. \n\nThe predator eats the prey, the predator eventually dies, it\u2019s body decays and feeds new life. It\u2019s a circle, a harmony. A Force. \n\nBut when someone comes along and takes more than they need and doesn\u2019t wish to feed back into the system, or is so filled with rage that they kill for their own satisfaction, or is so surrounded by cold and darkness and only wish to shut out or destroy the light- that is The Dark Side.

    "postText": "I think the first three episodes are rearranged masterfully. And the 6th is also pretty much perfect. A lot of awkward stuff is gone and the music is so good. But I still thought that it was lacking a little  around episodes 4 and 5. For example I think episode 4 could be cut entirely and almost nothing would be lost, but the movie would feel more tight (about 2 hours instead of 2.5) and the pacing of the story would also be better. And I think there are also some excess scenes with Tala and Haja and Ice Cube from episode 5. But this might just be personal preference.\n\nAnyway, how are the  other cuts and what do they differ in? Any that might be worth watching? Any one that cuts the God-awful episode 4?",

(Now Leia is not captured again and they move directly to Jabiim)\n\n\\- They moved the flashback combat scenes to the final confrontation of Obi-Wan and Vader, making a nice parallel between the two fights.  (Both edit use the de-aged version made by Darth Porg)\n\n\\- They use Battle of heroes (version rescored by Cinevore) for the final fight. That fit the scene better than Duel of the Fates imo.",

Even though they didn't reply to this one, you'll always see the same 10 names, or so, that feel compelled to reply to every post and reply early so they can set the tone, with windbaggish posts that are nothing but praise and making anyone who complains out to be \"tOxIc\". If you block those names you'll find that the quality of life around here significantly improves.",

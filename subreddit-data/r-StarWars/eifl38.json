The hard part is that there is a couple second delay until VLC actually starts playing the movie.  I moved everything to a SSD to try to at least make the delay consistent.\n\nUnfortunately New Hope is the most obvious when it's off by even a fraction of a second as it's not a long drawn out explosion.  It worked perfectly on my test run but it seems my SSD decided to be a tad slow when it counted!  Better luck next year!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the kind words!  I would definitely recommend trying this sometime if you're a Star Wars fan.  It's cool watching 4 movies playing  back seemingly at random but knowing that they're all going to sync up at the finale.  I was very happy with the results, the overlapping audio at the end was the coolest part.\n\nTo those asking:\n\n* New Hope and RotJ were the Despecialized editions which are the original cuts of the movies.\n* Keyboard is a Input Club K-Type with GMK Honeywell.\n* The  script starts playback according to how many seconds were left until  midnight.  My PC is really old so I did briefly stop and restart each movie close to midnight in order to resync the  video to the correct time.",

It may not have been their intention when TFA released, but everything just kinda worked out and now it's a nice connection from the ST era to the PT era.",

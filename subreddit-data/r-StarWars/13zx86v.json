That's kind of like retconning the episode 1 titles to say \"Darth Vader played by James Earl Jones\".\n\nIf all he does is the voice, should he really get credit for \"being\" The Mandalorian? The body acting, posing, and character comes across through the actor's movements, so whoever is in the suit should get credit (too).",

When you\u2019re 30, as long as you haven\u2019t quit or totally fucked up your life, they\u2019ll start calling you.\u201d \n  \nIt\u2019s a totally different field from acting, of course, but I feel like it\u2019s the same for him.

Like it\u2019s two layers of thick ass fabric on the sleeves. It\u2019s very warm and very comfy. Fits weird though, very large and long sleeves but the torso runs a little on the short and tighter side. If you\u2019re a skinnier dude it\u2019s true to size but if you have a gut I\u2019d recommend going up a size. Worth $90 imo.",

So if the whole idea is that the Force restored him to his \"ideal\" image, even if retained his age, he wouldn't look like old man Sebastian Shaw, he would still look like Hayden *because this motherfucker hasn't aged a day*.\n\nThat's just from a lore perspective, of course. If we're looking at it from an \"integrity of filmmaking\" perspective, then sure, we can talk all day about the merits of the Sebastian Shaw ghost.",

McDiarmid in *Empire* is probably the most glaring example. I just think the original theatrical versions should remain available, even if they're no longer canon.",

The Duel of the Fates really was an epic battle, and now Disney really needs to go above and beyond that, and their track record is pretty hit or miss at this point. How can they top Kenobi leaving Vader to die almost limbless and covered in 3rd degree burns on Mustafar?",

    "postText": "So I finished Jedi Survivor recently.  Not to spoil anything, but the High Republic as a setting is referenced (unless I completely misinterpreted something)\n\nI\u2019ve never felt much interest in it, so never sought out any high republic stories, but now I think it might be worth looking into.  So, High Republic fans, what\u2019s worth reading?",

That's your first read.\n\nBut be aware, if you're reading in hopes of learning more about Dagan  / Tantalorr / Zee / etc, you're out of luck.  All of the books so far deal with events taking place a little earlier In the timeline of the High Republic that appear to be separate from what's described in the game.\n\nThat said,  the High Republic authors have a history of taking things that seem unrelated and revealing connections.  So it's possible that stuff will appear in future books.",

It certainly left me wanting more, so I had to jump into the next book right away. \n\nI'm currently working my way through A Test of Courage, the first Middle Grade novel, and the characters are likable enough. Up next is Into the Dark, the first Young Adult novel. I've heard good things to say the least.\n\nI've been mostly trying to go by release order. I generally try to do that as it's usually the intended order to go through material. Gonna try to take in the whole High Republic if I can.",

But I'm certain that it won't be the case, because the Eighth Brother was a Jango Jumper, and this inquisitor looks much more like a human, and I have highlighted the major difference.  \nAnother easily noticeable detail is how his lightsaber is different, but that's not a good argument because he could have just got a new one.  \nThe thing that I'm wondering is why they gave him such close resemblance, considering the Inquisitors all have very distinct designs.",

That part was in there from the beginning, someone attacked the temple and the order was branded traitors. At that early stage I think the emperor was supposed to be a useless pupper to his administrators and aides.",

I don't think I've ever read it, but I would like to take a look. It might have been in the \"early\", but I really doubt it was in scripts/background in 1977",

The separatists weren't a thing until 2002 with AotC. There is absolutely no way Lucas was thinking about Separatists in 1977.",

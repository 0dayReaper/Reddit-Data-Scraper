I'm not really talking about how many forces were use in battle I'm talking more about what one battle was the most long drawn out and challenging battle on which both sides did not surrender. Was there one battle that lasted months or years without a stop. A battle in wich The Rebel Allience refused to retreat or surrender and it just dragged on.",

            "comment": "The Empire and the Rebellion as it's normally understood didn't fight that much. Until the events of Rogue One, the Rebellion was largely scattered throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe Empire was engaged with insurgents on Lothal and Jedha for awhile. They also took awhile to defeat and enslave the Wookies on Kashyyyk. But most of the armies that were put together to fight the Empire were largely destroyed quickly because the Empire had such a vast amount of resources.\n\nIt's also difficult for an Empire that only lasted like 25 years to have any long term engagements simply because they weren't around for that long. Now the Old Republic or the Sith Empire, they had battles that lasted centuries.",

It also has the distinction of massive ground aspects as well as a massive space battle. It dwarfs every other battle we saw, even Kuat.\n\nAdditionally, there continued to be battles on the surface of the planet for months after the actual battle finished, as various imperial holdouts refused to surrender and dug in.",

That would generally imply that it happened shortly after, not years later while the Empire sat around waiting for them to properly arm themselves.\n\nAt the time, Mandalore had no navy, there's not a damn thing they could do to challenge an enemy with overwhelming space superiority intent on levelling their planet rather than occupying it.\n\nMaybe we'll get more details at some point, but there's really no indication that anything happened other than, after the occupation ended, Mandalore was immediately besieged and soon after obliterated.",

In the Battle of Yavin they only send their best fighter squadrons (Red and Gold Squadron) out to take out the Death Star and Hoth was just one base (of which the Rebels have multiple). The entire reason why Vader himself is drawn to Hoth and brings a massive Imperial fleet there with him is because that's where Luke is. The Empire really didn't need to bring that much ground military with them to take out the Rebel base on Hoth. They did because A) Admiral Ozzel screwed up by jumping out of hyperspace too close to the system and alerting the Rebels to their presence and B) Vader was highly determined to capture Luke.",

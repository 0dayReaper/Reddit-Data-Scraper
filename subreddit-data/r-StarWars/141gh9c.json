    "postText": "I get the lore and their purpose, etc, but how does one actually read or gather information from what is in them?  Obviously this could just be plot hole picking, but some of the phrases you hear:\n\n* They store information and secrets\n\n* Any question you ask, it will answer (when merging the Sith and Jedi holocron in Rebels)\n\n* Users \"see\" information, assuming with their mind through the Force.\n\n* They are keys that open doors (Sith)\n\n* Is the information contained based on the user opening it, or is there specific information in each one like a selected book or text?\n\n* Who and how does information get put inside a holocron?  \n\nHas there been an explanation (canon or legends) of how they work?  Like if I open a library book, there's only so much information there, and if I read it, I will gather information, but that's only limited to the topic of that book. \n What does that look like in the form of a holocron?  Is there like some mental glossary that Force users can see and navigate for information?  Do they \"ask it\" and it just presents information in front of their minds?  If they ask or seek something in a holocron, does it ever \"error 404,\" the user because the information does not exist within that particular holocron?",

The Gatekeeper of the holocron will judge your degree of readiness and will teach you at his own discretion.\n\nIn new canon as we've seen in Rebels, holocrons just project recordings of the lessons that other jedi upload to them. The interface is not described, but there has to be one, maybe even verbal one that takes requests.",

    "postText": "So I see this image in multiple articles related to Phantom Menace. For instance, it's the first image in this one:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/heres-why-duel-of-the-fates-transcends-star-wars.html](https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/heres-why-duel-of-the-fates-transcends-star-wars.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr merged with Force Awakens screenshots like here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://screenrant.com/star-wars-phantom-menace-force-awakens-stories-similiar/](https://screenrant.com/star-wars-phantom-menace-force-awakens-stories-similiar/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't see it in the scene itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo\\_\\_6MZIg6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo__6MZIg6U)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything within the throne room itself; at least as far as the lightsaber duel goes; occurs within the first 70 seconds of this clip. Was that image a screenshot of a scene that was since deleted from the movie? Are there versions of it with that scene still in? Or was it not from any version or deleted scene and just a promotional image made to promote the movie?",

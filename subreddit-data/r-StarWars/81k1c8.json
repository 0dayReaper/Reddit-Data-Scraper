Past heros have a limited number of things that they can become if they don't die while completing their great quest.\n\nThey can become a king, a teacher/mentor for future heros, a prophet (who's frequently blind), and several others that aren't used as much. With Luke we got a little of the mentor and a lot of the blind prophet. He's blind because he cut himself off from the force. If you need some other modern examples, Paul Atreides in Dune and Neo in The Matrix follow very similar paths to Luke.",

It\u2019s a rare storyline to see explored these days, especially in a blockbuster, and I liked that about it. \n\nI mean, sure we all wanted Luke to have a noble, Yoda-like ending, but then again everyone imagines that for themselves.

I thought he was *so* wise with the Force that he could live alone in a hut and contemplate nothing but the universe, and that that would be as fulfilling to him as a life of adventure was to Luke. It wasn't until the prequels that I felt that interpretation was cast into doubt. \n\nAnd there's still a bunch of other stuff about Yoda that I simply can't accept from the prequels, and I have to separate it into two timelines: the Yoda as presented in the OT only, and the Yoda as described by the OT + prequels. Pulling out a laser sword is certainly something that falls into the latter category. (If the Yoda in the prequels *had* to fight, I always pictured him being so balanced with the Force that he'd simply deflect blows with his hands, but most likely would find some alternative solution long before a lightsaber fight became necessary.)",

    "postText": "So i generally enjoy the prequels and i think it might be because of my autism. anyone feel the same?\n\ni noticed i generally cant read faces well and i dont know many appropriate emotional responses and can not really distinguish good acting and bad acting unless its comically bad (like in THE ROOM or in porn) so one of the most glaring critiques i read of the prequels just kinda glances off me. i dont even think jarjar is annoying, i feel pretty neutral about him.",

            "comment": "I think it's okay to enjoy the Prequels without having to explain it through your experience with autism. There are plenty of people without autism who enjoy those movies too. You may enjoy some details that others don't focus on or have a different perspective on why you enjoy it. We all enjoy movies for different reasons sometimes. \n\nI think your appreciation for the Prequels is something you can think of as common ground with many fans. If you don't feel like you have similar interests as others most of the time, enjoy knowing your interest in these movies is shared with people of all types.",

By now though, there aren\u2019t many left who still despise the prequels anymore. Things like The Clone Wars and the plethora of other prequel-era content has given much more depth to them now. The same thing is starting to happen now with the sequels, too.",

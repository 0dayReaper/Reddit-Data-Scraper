If you'd told me years before it was official, that Momoa was going to be Aquaman, I'd have thought it was a lie.  Let me get this straight, the guy who played Ronon on Stargate Atlantis is going to be Aquaman and the guy who played Boba Fett is going to play his dad?!\n\nI think that's part of how those crazy rumors get started.  I'm not sure Tom Cruise as Superior Iron Man is much crazier than John Krasinski being Reed Richards.\n\nThinking back it would have been hilarious for them to use the voice actor from the Galactus radio drama to play Reed.  Why?  It's Ethan Peck.  They already had Captains Picard and Pike in Multiverse, why not Spock?",

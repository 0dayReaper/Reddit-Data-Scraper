He finds ex stormtroopers in Ep 8 but fails to rally them or get them to join the cause. The stormtroopers are scared as shit of the First Order like Finn was in Ep 7. \n\nHim and Rose go around this side of the story instead of Kanto Blight and her weird \"We save people\" nonsense is like a \"Fuck the stormtrooper exiles and their fears, likes be heroes.\"\n\nHe still ends up on the ship at the end, he still ends the film being defeated since the films narrative is about accepting defeat and getting back up again.\n\nBut in Ep 9 hes on the verge of becoming a real force user. He finds a way to convince the others to join the war effort and they show up at the final battle when the whole Galaxy comes to save the day against the Final Order.\n\nThe his story ends with Rey agreeing to train him to become a Jedi.",

Hell I did my own tweaks that kept the movies somewhat the same while meshing in EU elements. \n\nEdit: some of these changes was making the new republic not painfully stupid by having them not demilitarize rather be tied up in a war with criminal powers trying to make a power move which took priority over dealing with more of the empire's remnants nipping at their heels again, Kyle katarn being around still as well as playing a fairly important role in last jedi, and rey having been a student of Luke's Jedi academy that became so traumatized by Ren's massacre that she severed herself from the force and in essence ever forgot she was ever a Jedi in training. Also possesses force psychometry which helps her pick things a bit faster.",

Overkill, overkill, overkill like a bad anime.\n\nBy all rights the Final Order should be *completely* unstoppable even after that big dick fleet came in.\n\nIf Finn could get a few dozen ships disabled by mutiny and a few others completely turned \"good guys\" and start firing on each other you'd have a really epic scene as Finn starts to decimate parts of the order by pitting it against itself.\n\nHave some command ship somehow take control and start reorganizing around the battle and defeat the small pockets of rebellion untilt he Lando scene happens.\n\nThen you have Finn with ex-soldiers land on the Command Ship and take it out with an exiles vs Final Order battle on a Destroyer which gives them and the Lando group an edge. But instead of just the rejects from Endor you'd have newly turned stormtroopers who are discarding their armor and shit running down to help the good guys.",

That's would have been great.\n\nWe could've had Fin run across more dead troopers that he knew and have taken care of them, so like after a battle we see him organizing the dead, but just like a bunch of piles of dirt or something to symbolize them cause it's supposed to be available for kids and just a pile of corpses isn't something you show off in broad daylight, and on the edge of a mental collapse. Or we could have a depressed Fin, sitting alone when everyone else is celebrating a victory, and when one of our main cast, like Rey, which would give her something to develop off of too and would send him away from her as a love interest, asks him why he isn't celebrating he tries to just brush them away gently, giving hints that he doesn't want to talk about it, and referencing a problem a lot of guys have of wanting to deal with their problems alone, before they press further and say something about how they really showed those bucket heads. Then he snaps and starts shouting, yelling at whoever had talked to him about how they wheren't just a bunch of machines that killed, they where people, people why where taken from their family and raised from birth to fight for the first order. Faceless, without a name of their own. It would have driven home the point, that the trilogy tried to make, that your name doesn't matter, where you came from doesn't matter, what matter is what you do here and now.\n\nBut no, he has one of the highest stormtroopers kill counts in the movies, apart from Poe, Holdo, and Rey. Who destroyed a planet, a fleet, and another much larger fleet in that order.",

There was an old thought that the force was stronger when a jedi died, as they were then connected with the force. This could be the reasoning behind the search to maintain consciousness after death in the clone wars animated series by Yoda. But I'll digress and move on. \n\nTwo - the potential for the number of force sensitives could be a limited thing, but with the mass deaths, and the lack of anyone finding these people and training them, (10000 jedi died in the purge presumably per Rebels at least) that would be a large number of potential force sensitives. \n\nEh. That's at least how I think about it.\n\nEdit- Afterthought - all beings are sensitive to the force, the question is to what extent - source Rebels - animals can be more sensitive to it than people in some cases. When the mass death happened, the force potentially grew with all of the life forms contributing their living energy back to the cosmic force. (Different kinds of \"force\" being living and cosmic, if I remember correctly. Source TCW episode with the Father, Sister, and Brother.)\n\nMain point which the above post attempts to provide evidence for - Mass genocide of force sensitives caused mass amount of new force sensitives.",

Not equal amounts of light and dark, or done grey state of natural order and like most idiot gods (H.P Lovecraft) doesn\u2019t see nuance. So one explanation for all of the Force sensitive storm troopers might be that the force corralled them together in the same platoon/battalion for some reason yet unknown to us. \n\n\nI dunno, I\u2019m just trying to make sense of JJs horrible storytelling so it doesn\u2019t ruin it for me.",

Until recently, I always thought a force sensitive, or even a minor force user, could go their entire lives without developing if they never were shown the ways. Kinda like, if qui gon didn\u2019t land on tattoine, anakin might have just grown up being a really good pod racer and mechanic. And I always liked the way that sounded. But now we got highly advanced force techniques sprouting up as if they are a common and casual event.",

He clearly had history with him, he was aware of either Luke or Leia, I'd have liked to find out, maybe through some Luke exposition, how he tied in with things in layer films. But no, he just got tossed in the trash, apparently with any ideas of a continuous narrative, like so many other dead ends, and I found it a fitting comparison to the trilogy as a whole. Maybe it got covered in a comic series, like Luke's fight with the Knights of Ren or Kylo's crossguard saber explanation, but it would have been real nice to see it happen or heard it explained on screen, not read about it on Comic ComicVine or some shit.",

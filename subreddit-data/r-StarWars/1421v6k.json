    "postText": "i think ezra could be at pair of afew of the greatest jedis of the past  \nmaybe close to kit fisto level (obviously he would be much better than the jedis that \"fought palpatine\" excluding windu)  \nin terms of potential/midiclorian count: he could be a prodigy, i mean he learns a darkside ability, and a one pretty complex tho, the mind control i would put him close to mace windu, not more not less just close doesn't means he can beat windu, just that if he was train properly he could be powerful as him  \nin terms of experience and battles: he would be pretty good not at the level of the generals but sure close to ashoka from season 7 in terms of planning  \nskills: since season 2 ezra already was equal to kanan in lightsaber skills, when they were sparring it ended in a tie, and since in S4 seems pretty good, i would put him close to grand inquisitor, or in a jedi temple guard level more likely  \nin force power/abilities: maybe master kenobi from TCW, ezra has a great relation ship with animals and a great control over them he controlled the purgills, afew loth-wolfs, those things that attacked grand inquisitor and stormtroopers, loth-cats",

He what you'd call \"grown into his power\" somewhat, compared to his initial shaky steps on the jedi path. \n\nIn time he would've been as powerful as Cal Kestis probably. We'll see how timeskip treats him. Timeskip did magic on Ahsoka.",

That\u2019s not how it works. The Force can be a trickle, a stream, a river, a flood\u2026 for **anyone** who can sense it. Think of yourself as a door. The wider you open, the more easily the Force flows through you. Some people just start out with their door a bit more open. But any door can open wide.

The whole Canto Bight/Running from the FO bullshit I almost entirely forgot and the whole deal with Smoke was clearly just to move the plot along, but the deconstruction of the hero's myth with Luke and Rey's arcs was *interesting* (whether you actually liked it or not).\n\nLuke's journey and especially his \"fight\" with Kylo Ren was a highlight of the entire anthology for me. And Rey's exploration of her own identity as an orphan, as well as the prospect of a complex relationship with Ben was really interesting (immediate retconing notwithstanding).\n\nBut yeah, everything about TROS is forgettable and tbh TFA is not much better, though at least the characters were interesting and properly used/motivated since they weren't yet playing tug-of-war between fifteen interested parties at Lucasfilms.",

Ventress and Vosa, his apprentices both used two sabers, Savage used a saber staff, and even Palps seems to favour two sabers. Grievous speaks for himself.\n\nI like to think seeing Padawan Anakin try to pull some weeb shit against the greatest duelist of his generation just amped Dooku up, and he specifically cut off the arm to prevent that kind of nonsense in the future.\n\nIt only gets better in the ROTS novelization where Dooku is specifically super pissed that Skywalker now uses a prosthetic arm, as he feels a true warrior would learn to fight one handed.\n\nAnd then the cherry on top, dude gets killed by two sabers, one of which is his own and the other is held by the prosthetic arm he looked on with such contempt.",

Whereas the sequels, although enjoyable at certain times in their own right, don't ever seem to have that spark that could have been fanned into a flame. The hardships that Lucas went through ends in slightly less controlling role that he played in the originals was key, but not having him or someone like him with a vision at all for the sequels really hurt them.",

Sidious celebrates by shooting electricity into the air, laughs his maniacal laugh, and sits down on his thrown, grinning his evil grin. Then things just go quiet. All we hear is the low hum of the cave, and a few beeps from computers. Sidious' laughter is fading away, and he's wiping a tear from his eye.  Things continue to be quiet. His smile fades. Then off in the distance one of his henchmen asks, \"Now what?\" Then the fading smile is replaced with a sudden look of disappointment.  \"Oh shit.\" he says as he realizes how fucking boring life will now be. Fast forward seven years. He's on the streets of some alien city, people passing by, and he's handing out pamphlets. \"Become a Jedi!\" they're titled. \"You! Don't you want to be a _Jedi and fight the dark side_?\" Sidious says in a dramatic tone to a child passing by. \"Get bent, old man.\" the kid responds without so much as a a glance in Sidious' direction. Sidious turns to the droid next to him holding a stack of the pamphlets and signals a shrug of confusion. Sidious throws his small stack of pamphlets on the ground in frustration.

Even this edit, which is amazing, but is still less than what I expected going in the first time, would have sufficed. And what did we get? A few quiet voiceovers? When we\u2019ve SEEN many, many times before that force ghosts are a thing. Visible, ethereal forms of Jedi who have made themselves one with the force. I would have cried like a baby seeing them all again behind Rey, and it would have created much more of an appreciation of her as a character. \n\nThis scene could have undone EVERY OTHER BAD THING IN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE for me. I could have forgiven the Chewy death fakeout. I could have forgiven the Rey is a Palpatine thing. I could have forgiven Palpatine\u2019s return in the first place. I could have forgiven how they did Rose dirty like that. I could have forgiven every unnecessary character introduction and every awkward stock footage Leia interaction. If I could just see the Jedi again, helping Rey destroy Palpatine. Luke, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Anakin, Leia, Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, even Ahsoka and more from TV shows/books/games whatever. They could have made the effort because IT WAS THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE SKYWALKER SAGA. It deserves that much pomp and circumstance! If there ever was a time to over-do it it\u2019s now!!!!!!! \n\nBut unfortunately, Disney put their faith in JJ, a man who was in no way prepared to end the trilogy and the saga, fresh from coming off one of the most hated comic book runs of all time, to do this rushed job just because he made TFA and made them a bunch of money. He then took every good, forward-thinking change that Rian did in TLJ and threw them all out the window. \n\nSo JJ, I hope you\u2019re proud of your work here. Knowing that what was supposed to be the most epic conclusion to a cinematic story that began in 1977, spanning movies, shows, games, books, and everything in between, turned out to be a turd in the punchbowl because you couldn\u2019t ask Hayden Christiansen and Ewan McGregor to record an hour of footage for the fans in favor of having them send you a voicemail so you could have their whispery voices play behind a loud scene so that we all had to google whose voice it even was.",

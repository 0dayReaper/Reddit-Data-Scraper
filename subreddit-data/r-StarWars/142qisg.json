Just seems to be his MO.\n\nAnd TBH, the weird trope here is the expectation that an opponent *would* talk during battle. The villain taunting and \"monologuing\" is such a common trope that it feels odd when it doesn't happen. But IRL, once people commit to fighting, they mostly stop talking; it's a distraction from the life &amp; death struggle they're engaging in.",

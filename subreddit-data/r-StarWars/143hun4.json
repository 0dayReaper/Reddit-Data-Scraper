    "postText": "**Star Wars Episode VII: Echoes of the Past**\n\n1. The story opens with Chancellor Leia Organa leading the New Republic. Various political challenges, both internal and external, are revealed, alongside subtle rumors about Grand Admiral Thrawn and his Imperial Remnant fleet hidden in the Unknown Regions.\n2. Concurrently, Luke Skywalker runs a Jedi Academy on Tython, where he guides the new Jedi Order in their quest to understand the mysteries of the ancient Jedi.\n3. On another front, Poe Dameron and Finn, soldiers and close friends in the Grand Army of the New Republic, lead daring missions against remnants of the Empire.\n4. Han Solo and Chewbacca, upon hearing rumors of a force-sensitive individual among the Mandalorians, find Rey. Discovering her potential, they set course to the Jedi Temple on Tython.\n5. Leia, in the meantime, decides to visit Tython to see her brother Luke and her son Ben, who has passed the trials and is made a Jedi Knight. It's during this visit that Han and Chewbacca arrive with Rey. This eventful day brings about a long-awaited reunion between the original heroes - Leia, Luke, Han, and Chewbacca.\n6. Amidst this poignant moment, the need for Rey's training becomes clear, and she becomes the newest member of Luke's academy.\n7. In the final act, the rumors of Thrawn are confirmed as his fleet launches a surprise attack on Coruscant. The Senate building is evacuated, but Leia, with a determination characteristic of her, stays behind to coordinate the counterattack. The attack results in her untimely death.\n8. In response to the attack, Finn and Poe, now promoted to Generals, lead a counterattack against Thrawn. As the situation grows dire, and with Thrawn's fleet mercilessly bombing civilian targets, Finn makes a difficult decision. He evacuates his ship, asking Poe to do the same.\n9. Finn, in a heroic sacrifice, pilots his ship directly at Thrawn's flagship in an attempt to halt the bombardment, causing massive damage. However, it remains unclear whether Thrawn survived the onslaught.\n10. Amid the chaos of the attack, the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is destroyed, revealing an ancient Sith Temple beneath its ruins. This ominous discovery leaves the audience with a chilling sense of what's to come.\n\n**Star Wars Episode VIII: Shadows of Korriban**\n\n1. Three years have passed since the destructive attack on Coruscant by Thrawn's fleet. The New Republic, still recovering, stands tall under new leadership while the Jedi Order has begun to rebuild itself on Tython.\n2. Luke, sensing that Thrawn is still alive, begins to have visions of the ancient Sith homeworld, Korriban. Believing it to be a clue, he sends his most trusted Jedi Knight, Ben Solo, along with his Padawan, Rey, on a mission to Korriban.\n3. The quest takes Ben and Rey to the shadowy depths of Korriban, where they explore the ancient Sith temples and tombs. Thrawn and his fleet, however, are nowhere to be found.\n4. The journey takes a dark turn when the ceiling of the tomb of Darth Bane collapses, separating Ben and Rey. As Ben searches for a way back to Rey, the Sith ghost of Darth Bane appears to Rey, attempting to seduce her to the dark side.\n5. When Ben finally finds Rey, he senses a deep change in her. Realizing that she has turned to the dark side, he tries to reach out to her, pleading her to resist the lure of the Sith. But Rey, fully embraced by the dark side, attacks Ben, resulting in his death.\n6. Back on Tython, Luke feels a deep disturbance in the Force and is filled with grief when he realizes his nephew's demise and Rey's turn to the dark side. During his time of despair, he is visited by the Force ghost of his father, Anakin Skywalker, who offers him comfort and guidance.\n7. As news of Rey's actions and Ben's death reaches the New Republic and the Jedi Order, an urgent council is called. In this meeting, the leaders start planning how to counter the rising Sith threat, now made real and personal by Rey's betrayal. The episode ends with a heavy sense of uncertainty about the future.\n\n**Star Wars Episode IX: The Sith Reborn**\n\n1. A year has passed since the tragic events on Korriban. Rey has discovered Thrawn's hidden base beneath the scorched surface of Mandalore. Thrawn, recognizing Rey's power and determination, accepts her as his second in command.\n2. On Tython, the Jedi Order holds a solemn funeral for Han Solo, who died of grief following the loss of both his wife and son. The loss is immense, with Chewbacca, unable to bear the grief of losing his oldest friends, deciding to return to his home planet of Kashyyyk after saying a final goodbye to Luke.\n3. That night, Luke is visited by the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan reveals a long-held secret: Rey is his granddaughter, a result of a secret affair he had with Duchess Satine of Mandalore before the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan shares with Luke a hard-earned insight \u2013 that love is the essence of the Force and that the old Jedi Order's strict policy on emotional detachment was flawed.\n4. Driven by his love for his family and friends he has lost, Luke seeks out Rey, determined to bring her back to the light side. His confrontation with Rey ends tragically, with Rey, consumed by the dark side, killing Luke.\n5. Following Luke's death, Rey returns to Thrawn and persuades him that the time is ripe to destroy the Jedi Order and the New Republic. Thrawn, swayed by Rey's resolve, agrees to this dark plan.\n6. Rey returns to Tython and deliberately reveals herself to the Jedi Order and the Grand Army of the New Republic, luring them to Mustafar.\n7. The climax unfolds in a massive space battle above Mustafar, with the New Republic and Jedi Order launching an all-out offensive against Thrawn's fleet. Despite suffering heavy losses, the New Republic and Jedi manage to overcome Thrawn\u2019s forces and capture Thrawn himself.\n8. However, Rey manages to escape amidst the chaos, taking refuge in Vader's Castle on Mustafar. There, she is visited by the Sith ghost of Emperor Palpatine, who convinces her to reject the Rule of Two, the principle that had defined Sith relationships for centuries.\n9. Palpatine urges Rey to create a vast army of Sith to bring down the New Republic and the Jedi Order. The story ends with Rey, now a symbol of a new Sith era, beginning to plot her next move, setting the stage for the next trilogy.",

They spent 5000 years before Bane grinding their faces against the republic and jedi constantly being defeated more by their infighting weakening them.\n\nThe empire falls because the sith are incapable of producing a stable regime and he was never able to get reliably available superweapons up to get around that, the rule of 2 wasn't the fault there it was working perfectly fine at solving the specific problem it was designed to solve, giving up everything else that let them win is what defeated them.",

So instead we form one parasitic unbroken chain of greater and greater strength.  That worked perfectly the entire time pretty much and combined with the new \"do things in secret\" approach meant nobody knew they were there, taking over and getting more and more powerful over time.\n\nedit: The things that led the sith to lose in the OT had everything to do with the sith being a bad system that can't produce functional results and them not being able to be content to be the unknowing shadow masters of the republic but *having* to rule openly. Abandoning secrecy and the shadows was the problem, abandoning the only thing keeping the order itself stable won't improve that",

            "comment": "Nah this is terrible. If Star Wars is Generational epic, the stories need to involve the next generation of Heroes, and this creates a problem. The Prequels set up the big bads the OT had to defeat. The Sequels would need to do both, while looking for justification why the OT generation couldn't face the threat, failed in their own goals etc etc.\n\nAdditionally, this has way too many characters and too many moving parts. Movies are usually extremely simple and dumbed down stories, which is why movie adaptations of books are so terrible and why movies rely on trope so very much. Tropes allow the storytellers to communicate in as little time as possible who or what something is.\n\nThe Sequels as they are, aren't actually as bad as people make them out to be. There's a lot of great things in isolation, but when you put them in the order that they appear on screen, you end up with the hot mess.\n\nThe best way to make the Sequels is to rewrite the Force Awakens as a treasure hunt movie with Luke as the McGuffin, and reduce Han Solo's presence significantly. TFA opens great, just when Han Solo appears he trades a ship he's carrying with the dual protagonists and leads the first order on a merry chase in the Millennium Falcon while Rey Finn escape. Rey Finn in a new ship goes to a few spots from Luke's last known location and figure out clues that eventually lead them to Luke. Along the way they talk to people to understand the more recent Galactic history as well as Why Luke went into exile. Heck they could even end up having to track Lando down on a Casino world to get the commentary that nice looking rich places have even worse people than Mos Eisley and there's war profiteers providing arms to both the first Order and Resistance. What the movie doesn't need is a trench run or a planet sized death star. Starkiller base should be revealed in the final movie, and it can launch system destroying being through hyperspace, threatening the entire galaxy. The minor advatange is resistance spies can track when an attack is launched and what system so they can evacuate the planet in that time.",

We got what we got and it seems like Dave Filoni is \"fixing\" or at least expanding on the sequel trilogy through TV shows similar to the Clone Wars with the prequel trilogy.\n\nIn my opinion, bringing back Palpatine was an insult to Anakin's redemption arc.",

People say this stuff about pretty much every Star Wars movie, never stopped me from liking those either.\n\nFirst it was return of the Jedi that was the trash story that ruined Star Wars, then it was the special editions, then it was the prequels, then the clone wars was dumb garbage for kids, then rebels, then the sequels ruined Star Wars, then bad batch was dumb garbage for kids, then book of boba fett ruined Star Wars, then it was Kenobi, and currently it\u2019s the mandalorian, and then in a few months it\u2019ll be Ahsoka.",

In your first film they kind of chill around for a while, and the only looming threat was some rumors of thrawn. You can start in the middle of the conflict instead.\n\nI like some of your ideas. The hidden sith temple, the sith abandoning the rule of 2, rey turning to the dark side. Would actually be cool if they were added to the sequel trilogy we got. If snoke revealed rey to be his mindwiped sith apprentice, reveal that she was guarding a hidden sith temple on jakku this entire time. Snoke restores her memory.\n\nKylo still surprise kills snoke and darth rey defeats kylo, leaving him for dead, floating in space. Rey sets out to build that massive sith army during the timeskip between ep 8 and 9. Ben Solo is picked up and saved by Leia. Ben Solo goes through an arc that results in him reluctantly reforming to the light side. Is the only hope to stop darth rey at the end of ep 9. \n\nDont know what happens to Luke though lol. Maybe kylo\u2019s redemption arc starts with him reluctantly helping Luke rebuild a new jedi order.  Ok guys I know, my story is shit too",

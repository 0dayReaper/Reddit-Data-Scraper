He is Anakin himself, a young, cocky powerful Jedi who loves his friends and has no fear. He is Padme, a bold warrior who will sacrifice anything, including his life, for the greater good of the galaxy. He is Obi Wan, trained by the same big brother figure as Anakin. He is the Jedi, the pure force users of the light.\n\nAs Vader watches Luke being tortured by the Force Lightening, he sees the last piece of him dying on the ground and he sees the last living piece of Padme, this is his second chance to save Padme, his second chance to do the right thing and reject power for compassion. He spends all those years reliving the moment he lost Padme and he realizes that Luke IS Padme, it's Padme's son too and he makes the right choice.\n\nEither way, ROTJ is pretty perfect like the rest of the OT and I wouldn't change a thing.",

It also restores Kenobi and Yoda to physical form as well.\n\nVader embraces his son in an emotional \"you came back\" moment.\n\nWhere things went after that, unsure, but that was a planned execution of that scene at one point.",

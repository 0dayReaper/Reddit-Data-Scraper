I swear he fallen into starkillers role where his popularity is solely attributed to him being \"cool\".  Is there anyone else who just doesn't care about him?",

Cal takes back what he is in JFO, a jedi.\n\nIn JS, we meet up with Cal and he has really grown into his own as a fierce opponent of the empire and more importantly, as a jedi. He continues to learn and build his skills with a lightsaber and in the force eventually attaining what appears to be Jedi Master levels or at least very close to it.\n\nCal has a really cool ship &amp; squad in the mantis crew, Merrin especially is a really interesting character, being a nightsister &amp; also from Dathomir. \n\nIdk dude, Honestly for me, Cal seems pretty solid as a Jedi Protagonist in SW.",

Cere was much better in JS, to the point I actually liked her, but in FO I did not understand her at all. \n\nIdk I think putting Cal close to a Jedi masters level is pretty far fetched, just compare him to Cere. And as far as him being a threat to the empire, idk. It just seemed very forced (get it) and not genuine.\n\nLook you don't need to take my opinion, I am in the VERY tiny minority that thinks Rey has a beautiful arc, much better than Cal to tie it all together. It's just no part of me cares if we ever see Cal again.",

Cal used a force trick yes, but that should again be a testament to his skill in the force that it wasnt seen through and that absolutely has to be worth something towards Cal's skill.",

Ok he's from the high republic but we see him do nothing. Santari beats him, Cal beats him then he runs away, Cal and Bode have the upper hand and he runs away again, then Cal kills him. He has 4 fights in the game and loses all 4, doesn't seem very threatening",

Sorry you didnt gel with his character, maybe the next game will have somebody that sticks for you!",

Is Han Darth Vader's equal cuz he got the jump on him during the trench run? No, he just outsmarted him and caught him off guard.\n\nI'm really not trying to change your mind, I'm just giving my reasoning. I'm happy you like the character and enjoy the story, it just didn't click for me. Hopefully they tie it up well in three and I enjoy it. Peace \u270c\ufe0f",

That was a refreshing perspective in contrast to all those stories that follow some special A-Team protagonist(s), chosen ones etc. dealing with the fate of the entire Galaxy. Having him go against Vader was a bit much but since he was effortlessly beaten without any chance of victory did put him in his place.",

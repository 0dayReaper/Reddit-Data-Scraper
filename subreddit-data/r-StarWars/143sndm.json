I\u2019ve gotten close to finishing all the current canon novels, got like 8-9 left I think, I\u2019ve read 50ish I\u2019d say. I\u2019ve barely scratched the comics though, there\u2019s a ton of content in those. For books, I\u2019d recommend you either start with one of the newer big publishing events like the High Republic, or pick and choose some stories that sound interesting. \n\nDon\u2019t know how big of a reader vs. audio book person you are, I\u2019m normally more of a paper reader, but Star Wars audio books do tend to be pretty good too. And you can listen to those while doing other stuff, like games and driving. I\u2019ve finished a few recent novels that way when I was busy and it was a good experience. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend stories by Claudia Gray(!), Timothy Zahn(!), Charles Soule(!), E.K. Johnston, Cavan Scott, Alexander Freed(!), James Luceno(!), Beth Revis, or Justin\u2019s Ireland. The (!) ones are some of my top favorites. Different books have different vibes. Alexander Freed does military style fiction well. Claudia Gray and Charles Soule do stories about the Force and general character work very awesome. Zahn tends to just write Thrawn stories but those stories are often dope.",

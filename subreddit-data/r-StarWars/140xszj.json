    "postText": "After reading some on the background of of our favorite overused Dark Lord, I discovered some entries stating his dislike of lightsaber combat, despite his general mastery of each form. This prompted the idea of his fight against the Jedi who came to arrest him, but instead of dueling them blade to blade, he relies on his usage of the dark side, as was his preference. Any thoughts?",

I'm impressed.\n\nAhsoka Tano: That is what the Council wanted.\n\nBo-Katan Kryze: Still. You succeeded where many have failed.\n\nAhsoka Tano: I've learned from the best, including you.\n\nBo-Katan Kryze: I wish I was good at something other than war.\n\nBetween Anakin and Bo-Katan, yeah, you're going to get something more hardass than Kit Fisto.  Kit was from that generation trained to be keepers of the peace.  He was raised when the idea of having to really fight for your life in a lightsaber duel was unthinkable.  Ahsoka, on the other hand...\n\nRex: Something on your mind?\n\nAhsoka: As a Jedi, we were trained to be keepers of the peace, not soldiers. But all I've been since I was a Padawan is a soldier.\n\nRex: Well, I've known no other way. Gives us clones all a mixed feeling about the war. Many people wished it never happened. But without it, us clones wouldn't exist.\n\nAhsoka: Well, then perhaps some good has come from all of it. The Republic couldn't have asked for better soldiers, nor I a better friend.\n\nKit probably never had to take a life until well into his adult years.  Ahsoka spent her childhood building a large body count.\n\nAs for how effective dark side stuff is, again, she was around Anakin ALL THE TIME.  This was just the usual, for her...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lk9K8TnEouA\n\nFrom her vision on Mortis...\n\nOlder Ahsoka Tano : Are you happy, child? Your master, does he treat you well?\n\nAhsoka Tano : What concern of it is yours?\n\nOlder Ahsoka Tano : I am your future. Your potential.\n\n[Ahsoka ignites her lightsabers] \n\nAhsoka Tano : This is a trick!\n\nOlder Ahsoka Tano : There is a wildness to you, young one. Seeds of the dark side planted by your master. Do you feel it?\n\nAhsoka Tano : No! He is like no other Jedi! Passionate, impulsive... but I trust him with my life!\n\nOlder Ahsoka Tano : There are many contradictions in you. And in him. Be warned, you may never see your future if you remain his student! Leave this planet!\n\nSo, yeah, she built a tolerance to Sith Scream.  It wouldn't have affected Anakin, either.",

Yoda and Palpatine are masters beyond anything that the other Jedi are capable of. The other Jedi *do* train in the Force from childhood, but they simply will not reach the level that Yoda and Palpatine are at. They need lightsabers to beat someone else wielding a lightsaber. Yoda and Palpatine should not need a lightsaber to beat someone else wielding a lightsaber. If their mastery of the Force is really so great, they should simply be able to overpower a lightsaber wielder using *only* the Force.\n\nYou keep asking these very pedantic questions that have nothing to do with my point. It honestly makes me wonder if you've even actually watched Star Wars before. This is all very fundamental stuff established in the first three movies. The Force, lightsabers, Yoda and Palpatine, all of it. But you honestly sound a bit like you're genuinely asking me to explain how it all works. Maybe just sit down and watch the films?",

At some point, lightsabers were invented. In order for the average Jedi and the average Sith to compete with each other, they both need lightsabers. If only one of them had a lightsaber, it wouldn't be a fair fight because they are fairly equal in the Force. Yoda and Palpatine are *not* average. They are significantly more powerful in the Force. More powerful to the point that they should not need lightsabers in order to combat other people with lightsabers.\n\nHere, I'll break it down as dumb as I can with numbers. Most Jedi have 10 Force points. Most Sith have 10 Force points. Let's say that a lightsaber is worth 5 additional points. A Jedi with 10 Force points and no lightsaber loses to a Sith with 10 Force points plus a lightsaber. So in order to make it a fair fight, the Jedi needs to use a lightsaber also. Yoda and Palpatine have 100 Force points. They should not need a lightsaber to compete with a someone who has 10 Force points plus a lightsaber. They beat them with Force points alone.\n\nI cringed the entire time I wrote that just now. I literally cannot dumb it down any further than that. I won't be replying anymore because this is exhausting. Goodbye.",

I always thought it would be cool to show that Yoda was as above or beyond actually crossing saber blades with an opponent, and was able to block and disarm Dooku\u2019s attacks without one. Palpatine could have been a dark mirror of this as well, defeating the arresting Jedi without drawing a lightsaber.",

Ian Mcdiarmid (who plays Palpatine) had practically no time to learn any of the moves, and they couldnt use a stunt double for most of it because Lucas really wanted the close-up shots to see the emotion in each actors face. Sam Jackson already had some lightsaber training from Attack of the Clones but Mcdiarmid had never done it before and is obviously older. \n\nHence the reason that scene feels a bit awkward and dissapointing.",

So of course, Palpatine pulls out a lightsaber, why not?\n\nThis was also after AOTC. Yoda pulling out a lightsaber and jumping around like a little CGI Gremlin, after tacitly agreeing with Dooku that their fight cannot be decided through mastery of The Force, is one of the worst moments of all of Star Wars. It's hard to put into words just how wrong it is, how it completely undermines everything Yoda was about in the best Star Wars movie ESB. \n\nIn comparison, Palpatine also pulling out a lightsaber wasn't as big of an issue in ROTS. By that point, you would have been silly to expect anything better.\n\n I have seen posts here talking how much they love Yoda jumping around with a lightsaber, so I don't know if my opinion is a common one or a minority, but I do stick behind it regardless. Yoda and Palpatine using lightsabers was a terrible decision by a writer crapping out scripts as fast as he could. But once one pulled a lightsaber out, then why not the other? And from that point, I've just had to accept that future media will show Yoda, Palpatine and any similar characters as lightsaber users.",

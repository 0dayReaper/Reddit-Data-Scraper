I love too that I look back down this table and we are presided over by Padm\u00e9 [a Daniel E. Greene oil painting of Padm\u00e9 Amidala,female lead of the Star Wars prequel trilogy and Leia's mother]. There's a powerful idea there about this matriarchy coming back and subverting what hss always been dominantly patriarchal in male heroes: Zeus, Hercules, and everything else. What happens with Kylo and what he does to his father is, structurally, not a redeemable act. There's no coming back from that, the way he does it currently. But I've never see the mother figure try to do it. And maybe she could.\"\n\n&gt;John Knoll: \"The super-intriguing setup in Empire, 'That boy is our only hope.' 'No, there is another.' I felt cheated in Jedi that this really didn't go anywhere. But maybe Yoda is really talking about what happens with Leia in VIII, thirty years in the future.\"\n\n&gt;Dave Filoni: \"I love that. We should shift it so Leia is the Obi-Wan of this entire trilogy. I don't even think that it hurts that she's not primarily that mentor figure in VII because, like John had been saying, the audience expectation is so on Luke. And when that proves not to be true, it's way more powerful. It's dangerous, because it makes it so about the women of Star Wars. Something to me says that's right. \"There is something happening culturally. You look at birth, regeneration, the world itself needs healing: All of those things are emblematic of the 'mother' character in myth. They are all matriarchal things-Mother Earth itself, global warming is a hot topic. George [Lucas] was always so good at tapping into what's happening in culture. And he hits us with it. The idea that we have Leia, a mother character who needs healing in her own right-That's something we can get into in a deeper way.\"",

The actors aren't allowed to keep props and outfits, they are the property of the studios, and the studios need to keep them in case things like reshoots happen or sequels or prequels decades down the line, perhaps.  Or hell, they might even wanna be able to sell everything one day, to places like the hard Rock Cafe. Get a cool few million dollars for some kinda iconic batsuit or something \n   \nActors keeping their lightsabers is the exception, not the rule, in the film industry.",

Plus you can go absolutely bonkers with it if you want, put in all the cheat codes so you have unlimited spells, and just destroy the enemy camps with dozens of volcanoes that suddenly appear and erupt right in the middle of their town\n  \nI wonder if there's any god games like that these days. The RTS genre is making a comeback but not the god game genre, it seems. \n  \nAlthough if Theme Hospital counts as a god game, then there's a recent new game called Two-Point Hospital which is *amazing*, it's absolutely 100% a spiritual sequel to Theme Hospital, it's got all the same kind of humour, but there's just way way more of everything.\n   \nAnd Peter Molyneux made that spiritual sequel to Populous called Godus, but it got bad reviews.",

Last I checked (last autumn), they were still bundling old DOSBox versions that doesn't work with macOS 11. Got it to work by fiddling with DOSBox myself, but it was a chore.\n\nIf you're on Windows or Linux you're probably good to go.",

    "postText": "I have mostly watched the movies and some of the shows. However the tie in from the start of The Bad Batch and Kanan's trauma in Rebels was really compelling for me. I'm sorry I don't have time for a lot of books these days, but I would love any other recommendations of powerful stories that came out of that time period, short comics, etc.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit to add: I am re-watching Clone Wars now, because I love that part of the story too. Any supporting comics or maybe a \\*short\\* novel would be right up my alley!",

One of the threads on there are something along the lines of \u201cthe clone wars Essential episodes\u201d\n\nThis will give you the episodes from \u201cthe clone wars\u201d show combined with the movie Revenge of the Sith, the show \u201cTales of the Jedi\u201d will give you the main plot of order 66",

I was hoping some people had some other recommendations about the time period I may not have heard of, like in comics and such, because it's such a critical and powerful moment in the history of the world.",

The aftermath of O66 shows some retrospect in the form of flashbacks. TPB is the way to go, or digital. The single issues are outrageously priced right now.",

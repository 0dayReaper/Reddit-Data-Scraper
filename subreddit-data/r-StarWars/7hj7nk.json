And Mark Hamill is *from* California dn in the entertainment business, so again it's pretty safe to assume he lives in Southern California.\n\nSo not to take away from Mark Hamill doing this totally awesome thing, but I think it's reasonable to expect it was a not-unbearable drive for Mark to get to this kid. Other than the fact that he would have been driving in Southern California, of course.",

I imagine there's a non 0% chance of that being a thing, so maybe it is possible he wouldn't have to drive. But in that case he'd then just take the helicopter to the kid, so again we're at a wash.\n",

He remembers seeing stars like Vivian Vance and being too nervous to approach them. When Groucho Marx came in, Hamill dared to walk over, matchbook in hand, to ask for an autograph. The legendary comedian asked the boy his name, then went into character. \u201cMark Camel? You don\u2019t look like a camel!\u201d Hamill\u2019s impersonation is spot-on.\n\n\u201cIt was effortless,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cHe signed the matches, and I went back to my seat. Later, he got up to go to the men\u2019s room and did the slouch walk. He knew I was sitting there. He did it just for me. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d Hamill, for his part, is famously tolerant of the hordes of Star Wars fans who continue to approach him for autographs and selfies. When the studio offered to screen a cut of The Last Jedi for him and his family, he declined, saying he\u2019d rather wait to watch it with a crowd.\"",

I recall the PA or Director begged (maybe cajoled) him to return to shooting. \nFunny thing was I did the scene several times, wasn't directly interacting with him. While I was picking over the craft services after several takes, I heard him speaking to another extra and his voice was unmistakable. Best day ever!",

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force\n\nalthough one of mace windu's disciples and younger jedi apparently started reciting this creed, which i agree with more, but is very different than the first idealogically.\n\nEmotion, yet peace. Ignorance, yet knowledge. Passion, yet serenity. Chaos, yet harmony. Death, yet the Force\n\nthe original creed lead to things, from my perspective, like anakin not allowed to be married, because love is also a powerful emotion that could cloud his judgement, being devoid of wordly anchors was more important to the order than teaching the disciples how to control and segregate their emotions when performing their duties.

And he says \"you die in childbirth\" as if he knows it's a fact, not just stating what happens in the dream, which I figured was enough to clue Padme in that he was serious.\n\nHe's also by this point had his little \"I'm not powerful enough\" power-hungry rant in front of Padme. Combined with the ominous \"I'll find a way to save you Padme\" declaration, I don't know how many more signs he could've given her.\n\nNinja edit: Obviously it would be great if he sat down and explained everything, and it's perhaps unfair to pin it on padme for not recognizing his, shall we say, symptoms. But since his character is kinda predestined to turn to the dark side, we can't expect him to behave super rationally, it's just not in his character. But it is in Padme's, which is why I'm focusing on her inactions.",

Whether you buy the \"loss of will to live\" or siphoning of life force to reanimate Vader, Anakin's choosing to side with Palpatine led to her death.  Anakin's vision was a self-fulfilling prophecy; his drive to save her ended up resulting in her death.  If they had been allowed to marry openly, he may never have had those visions at all or even if she DID die, he could have raised their child(ren) without fear of retribution. ",

It was a lightsaber combat technique which used strong emotions during the fight, like anger and passion for swordfighting. Not many could master it because it led many to the dark side (emotions you know) so it was naturally forbidden but Windu was allowed. Also, his purple crystal was a gift from sentient crystalic being during one of his missions.\n\n\nEdit: I am aware that the reason about purple lightsaber is that Jackson asked for it so he can be seen in the arena, but his color choice was made canon through aforementioned events.",

Around 7 Mark Hamill has to leave but instead of just taking off he got up and walked down the line to make sure he not only signed something for everyone but also took a few seconds to talk to them. He was a super nice guy. ",

            "comment": "One of the reasons he used the toxin was it was painless. He and his son Boba cared for Zam. That's a mix of canon/non-canon. \n\nI would also imagine a blaster bolt was easier to deflect by the Jedi and perhaps it wasn't a guaranteed death like the toxin ensured.\n\nTo answer your question though; A lot. Obi-Wan,Padme, and Anakin wouldn't have been captured so all those Jedi wouldn't have been killed that day in the arena. The clone army would have still been available to the Republic but at what time? Would the Kaminoans have eventually contacted the Republic with a call? \"Uhhh your order is ready for pick up\". Jango would be alive to provide more DNA so Omega Fett wouldn't be such a target for capture. Speaking of Omega; Would her and Boba and Jango become aware of each other if Jango had lived? \n\nI would say Dooku would have had more time to build an insanely large droid army/navy and perhaps even destroy the Kamino cloning facilities if things didn't unfold the way they did. Then again Palpatine was the one behind the scenes pitting both sides against each other so perhaps things would've unfolded with the same result no matter what; The destruction of the Jedi.",

So he wouldn't have destroyed the facilities on Kamino, despite the episodes of the Clone Wars in which Ventriss leads an assault on one such city (that whole arc is kinda a big plot hole).\n\nOther than that, I completely agree with your analysis.",

He just needed help and that's why he made the comments on wishing Qui-Gon was still alive. As if Dooku didn't understand just how big the clone army actually was so when they showed up shortly after that conversation he was genuinely shocked at how much power Sidious now had. Not just Senatorial influence but a massive army as well. \n\nMaybe Dooku felt that his control over the Separatist forces gave him power to counter his Sith partner and in that moment he realized he was mistaken. Yet that happened after his recruitment attempt  with Obi-Wan so why did he openly discuss Sidious and his influence over the Senate with Obi-Wan? He wouldn't have been desperate for help at that point would he?",

Explosion on the platform lets that happen, and he can say he'd feel better if she had Jedi protection. That's move 1.\n\nMove 2, get Padme off of Coruscant, *and* give a clue to Kamino. Zam Wessel has no chance of succeeding if there are good Jedi protecting Padme, which Palpatine arranged for. He also arranged for Jango to kill her with a traceable weapon. Both things done with one move.\n\nPadme is gone from the capital, leaving an easily manipulated Jar Jar behind. Obi Wan is investigating, and Palpatine knows OW is skilled enough to get there. So, Kamino will be found, and Padme won't be around to rally votes against the Army. Two moves, that the Jedi did exactly what was expected of them. Most people watching could predict the Jedi moves there, and Palpatine has the force to help him see what they would do.\n\nHe may have been gambling a bit on Jango escaping OW, and OW tracking Jango to Geonosis. But he also could have had backup plans to kidnap Padme in place, and didn't need them. We know *he* knew where Padme was going, so it would not be a big problem to get her and take her to the arena on Geonosis. The gamble paid off, though, and she got there herself.",

My frustration is I don't believe George was thinking about all of that when writing the story. I think he just wrote out the sequence of events, hoping viewers wouldn't think too hard about it and wonder what exactly Palpatines plan was. If his goal was to start the clone wars exactly like they did, so many things could have gone wrong along the uber complicated plan.\n\nHere's a post I made about this topic that nobody read lol. It explains my questions some more:\n\nAOTC Observation: The Way in Which Obi-Wan Discovered the Clone Army Required a Ton of Specific Things to Happen. There's No Way Palpatine/Dooku Could Have Planned That. It had to Just be Dumb Luck on Kenobi's Part.\n\nThe more you think about it, it becomes clear that the beginning of the Clone Wars was made possible either by an extremely convoluted plot by Palpatine executed to perfection, or it happened by chance and started earlier than he wanted it to and just decided to roll with it.\n\nWas Zam Wesell always meant to die?\n\nWas Jango hired to lure a Jedi to Kamino, ensure the Jedi would discover the Clones, and then lure him to Geonosis?\n\nIs Dexter Jetser the key to all of this?\n\nWas Palpatine planning on helping his newly pregnant secretary raise thier children for a few years before kicking off the Clone Wars only to be thwarted by a caf\u00e9 cooks knowledge of Kaminoen  weapens tech?\n\nIs Dexter Jetster a Sith Lawd apprentice to Darth Jar Jar???\n\n\n\nYeah the post is a joke but the main plot hole is that Dexter Jetser was instrumental to Obi-Wan finding Kamino haha",

                                    "comment": "I would say that, since Obi Wan got to Kamino at just the right time to see the completed first wave of clones, got to Geonosis as the Speratist council was meeting to discuss kicking off the war, and at a time when the number of Jedi available for a rescue mission was unusually low, we have to assume that it kicked off exactly when Palpatine intended.\n\nPalpatine brags about things proceeding as he had foreseen. If we accept that as true, then much of the stuff that had to be dumb luck just isn't. You create a plan to get what happens in AotC to happen. Then you look at the future. Does it work? No? Find where it broke down, tweak the plan, and look again. This is similar to Dr. Strange saying he looked at however many futures and only found one in which they won. He finds the one in which he wins, and he goes with it.\n\nJedi are the best warriors in the galaxy, and very few Jedi ever fell to non-Jedi before Order 66. Anakin pointed this out in TPM. Assuming this is true for the elites, like the council, then Palpatine would know that no, Zam Wessel is not going to be one of the people who succeeds at beating a Jedi, even just by making it past them to kill someone else. Confidence that Zam Wessel would fail and need to be killed would be high, so saying Zam was always intended to die makes sense.\n\nJedi seem to have a lot of connections to people (not as apparent in the movies, with Dexter being the clearest movie example, so I'll admit this is not the most solid answer). Jedi definitely tend to be obeyed as law - Anakin's \"Jedi business\", Obi wan cutting an arm off and everyone turning away until real government agents came in. So even if Palps knew nothing about Dexter, it isn't a reach to think they would identify it as a Kaminoan saberdart, and get to Kamino. If they hadn't found that, though, it's entirely possible there were a bunch of backup plans in place to get them to the same place (erasing the archives may have been one - the archives have been tampered with, and a planet has been erased, maybe we should check it out). Or, back to proceeding as I have foreseen.\n\nI see how it is possible, maybe even likely, that Lucas didn't exactly have it all worked out in his mind. But him having it worked out that Palpatine's particular strength is seeing the future, so he actually can do a convoluted gambit to get to his goals, seems likely.",

The only possible reason for him to do so is so that someone could figure that out, and get to Kamino.\n\nBecause if Obi Wan doesn't find Kamino, no one picks up the Clone army, and the Clone Wars don't happen. So Jango had to have been specifically told - part of your duty is to make sure that you leave an obscure clue behind. Can't be obvious, but it has to lead back there eventually, in a way that a Jedi can find it.",

It has to be a previous design since dex recognizes it, so it's not like they were making then just for Jango.",

The \u201cassassination\u201d attempt on Padme was just a ruse to lead Obiwan to Kamino so he could \u201caccidentally\u201d discover the clones and then lead him to Geonosis so he could \u201caccidentally\u201d uncover the separatists\u2019 droid army.\n\nLike, why else was Zam involved at all? Jango provided the flying droid and the poison centipedes, all Zam had to do is send it on its way and then stupidly wait around for the droid to come back to her. Which the droid did, after failing it\u2019s mission and with a Jedi currently hang off of it! Like, maybe self destruct is called for?\n\nAlso note that the droids on Geonosis managed to capture Obiwan very quickly\u2026 AFTER he radioed back the separatist plot, not before.\n\nThe whole thing was absolutely Palp\u2019s setup. Notice how quickly he was ready to suggest Obiwan guard Padme after the bombing attempt? He knew exactly what he was doing, and I believe Jango did too.",

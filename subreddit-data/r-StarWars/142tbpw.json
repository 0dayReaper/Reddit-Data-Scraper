    "postText": "This is probably going to start a big massive debate but I thought I'd share it anyway - It's always bugged me that I just couldn't quite place why star wars just feels so different after Disney took over; I remember being a kid and watching Phantom menace and the feel of the galaxy was amazing - it was something that permeated the air as we anticipated it and saw all the beautiful shots of naboo on promo posters and collected the characters on pop cans for the little bits of lore on the side of them. I just now realized what is different: it's because under Disney, Star Wars purposefully shoots for a Pg-13 rating when writing the stories.\n\nWhen writing the first 2 prequels, George Lucas was obviously shooting for a PG rating as far as what stories he was telling, and when you do that it shows. There's a certain levity that comes from knowing how dark you're allowed to go, and how  you have to balance your story. Mostly because of Superhero movies, Pg-13 means 'cool' now, and if a movie is PG then people think it's not a good story. When you aim at PG-13 it means literally the only lines you can't cross are full-on sex, gratuitous language, and a level of violence that George's star wars never really approached. This means with a PG-13 rating you can go WAY darker in tone than George Lucas was ever aiming at for most of the movies, and the feel of the storytelling naturally changes.\n\nYes, I know that Revenge of the Sith is Pg-13, but that was because you had to show a ton of Jedi dying all at once, including implied deaths of 8 year olds, and watching someone get their limbs chopped off and burn almost to death. Those were requirements of the story that couldn't be avoided, but even then you can see George's tendencies to lean away from the dark with the way he films those scenes - the only time you see padawan-aged kids die is either one very far away shot with Bail, or a far-overhead establishing shot. Plo Koon explodes in a starfighter; Aayla's body is hidden by the environment after the first few shots; with Ki-adi-mundi he uses a shaky camera; the one on the speeder we just see the speeder crash and that's what the camera is focused on, not where her body went. \n\nModern star wars, for better or for worse, isn't leaning towards PG at all - it in fact the tendency is to push boundaries in the other direction - that's why the galaxy feels generally oppressive, mean and morally muddy. Alec Guiness said that what attracted him to the world of Star Wars was that the line between good and evil was so bright - there was no mistaking it. They started messing with that quality quite a bit and now a lot of it is just grey, with the rebels being sortof nasty in some of their methods, and the new republic being a stupid bureaucracy that can't be bothered to help people who need it without political incentive.  \n\n\nIn essence, I think they never understood that Star Wars is a fairy tale.\n\nEdit: this was also what was wrong with the most recent trilogy of Star Trek movies. Star Trek from its inception is a utopian science-fiction. They just kind of made it regular science fiction. If you take the utopia out of Star Trek, you lose its soul.",

            "comment": "This sort of misunderstands the way ratings, and the perception of violence in movies, has changed over the course of four or so decades. For its time, A New Hope was respectably violent; Vader strangled someone to death, Owen and Beru were reduced to smoking skeletons, Obi-Wan cut a guy's arm off and left it in a pool of blood, Han shot a guy in cold blood, quipped, and walked away. Sure, Obi-Wan disappeared in a metaphorical puff of smoke, but we definitely watched Porkins struggle, and fail, to not explode to death over the Death Star.\n\nThe ST is certainly in keeping with the level of violence of the previous films, adjusted for the way audiences have changed over the decades. And trying to focus on ratings rather than the actual content of the movies seems like an attempt to find some objective metric to use to say ST Bad, rather than actually engaging with the texts themselves.",

Evil is evil and good is good. A fairy story is about light fighting against darkness. It\u2019s all about how it\u2019s handled in tone- is it adventurous or oppressive? I never found ANH to be a bloodbath.\n\nThe Ewoks also never eat people- and the scene is played for comedy because obviously that\u2019s not gonna work.

A fantasy film.\n\nBut the concept of Star Wars was oozing with unwritten Lore.\n\nAnd Lore = Money  \nbecause you can chip in on a potential unlimited supply of merchandise.\n\nTo sell the merchandise, you\u2019ll need stories and characters to develop and release them to attract a large audience.\n\nIf they kept the line between good and evil so bright, then you\u2019ll loose the attention of the audience, because it will become \u2018boring\u2019. Fairytales start with a once upon a time or a long time ago and always end with a \u2018happily ever after\u2019\u2026",

And I don\u2019t know if it loses people\u2019s attention- people love fairy tales. They only get bored when you are doing an exact copy of another one. \n\nAnother example: fairytales generally don\u2019t have the undead, so while it\u2019s a funny thought experiment there\u2019s no way \u2018death troopers\u2019 needs to be canon.",

Every one of the post-buyout releases.\n\nI noticed the murder worship in R1 (which I realized was the first SW to feature a Sith using a saber and no Jedi). I noticed that an innocent person gets cudgeled to the ground in TFA for suspicion of stealing and it's never mentioned again (in or out of the movie). Very different even from Han shooting a being who has promised murder.\n\nHmmm.",

The same scene could happen where Han shoots him in the heart, Greedo screams and falls to the floor, and Han shoots him in the head. I would expect that sort of thing from modern star wars tbh",

Ahsoka responded with a Mandalorian massacre, including the classic quadruple decapitation.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aPRCN-5LghI\n\nAnd suicide.  Let's not forget that.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fGZR8U-UpAk\n\nSo, the Disney stuff is like George Lucas's kids cartoon show, but much less decapitation and slaughtering of entire villages.",

And as far as a cartoon goes, it being a cartoon does lighten it by definition because we know they don\u2019t exist. \n\nAdditionally, the only reason they could do that is because of the fact that they\u2019re faceless and wearing helmets and armor. They would not be able to do that to a character without a helmet.\n\nThis is also why clone wars has the ridiculous propensity of kicking every time there\u2019s an opening in a lightsaber fight",

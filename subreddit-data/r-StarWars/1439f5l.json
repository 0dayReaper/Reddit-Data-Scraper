            "comment": "Anime doesn't scale to Star Wars very well, and One Piece in particular basically runs on the toon logic even before Luffy got that power explicitly. \n\nIf you want my opinion, then probably not. Even though beskar is not literally indestructible magically - it's still so incredibly tough that almost nothing can break it by force. \n\nThe Haki enhances the durability of the object, but it doesn't make it indestructible, it just holds it together up to a certain point. There will have to be a moment where the wielder's strength has to push through instead of the toughness of the object. \n\nHowever it should be noted that almost all examples of beskar being shattered involved using the Shatterpoint ability, which is basically Star Wars answer to Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, so I'd say that without a special Devil Fruit power, you probably won't be breaking mandalorian iron.",

Before that time, I've never seen The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope. I didn't enjoy either. I'm also 32, so it's not like I \"grew up\" on the prequels, and so my expectations have changed. It's just that I couldn't get past the cheesy lines and 70s/80s acting in the original three. Sure, Jar-Jar was an awful attempt at comedy and Hayden Christenson's acting in the other two was a bit too flat, but the rest of the actor's carried their weight quite well and I enjoyed the political intrigue of the Republic and the fantastic locations.

You see so much death and destruction and hopelessness by the end of the movie. Order 66 always cuts me deeply. Obi-Wan's final words to Anakin were powerful. The look in Yoda's eyes when he fails to defeat Palpatine. \n\nEpisode 3 definitely is in the top half of the main 7 movies for me. George Lucas really tied a good bow with it. The only major complaint about it for me is the stilted romance dialogue but that's it. I thought everything else was done well.\n\nEDIT: typo",

If I tried to do this, the whole thing would flare up at once and I'd be left with a large black smoldering circle.  It looks like he's using little beads of gun powder, probably pyrodex, instead of actual powder which would explain the more controlled burn.  Real powder would go up in a flash and smear that white canvas black everywhere it touched.  ",

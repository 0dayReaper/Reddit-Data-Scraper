Re-Watching episodes 1-3 recently made me realize how close Anakin was to being an amazing Jedi Master. \n\nIn my opinion it all came down to the late start in his training. If they had trained Anakin from a younger age he would have had more control over his emotions. But he already experienced a childhood, and a hard one at that. Slavery, disputes with other pod racers, and childhood bullies. Not to mention what happened with his mother was when he was still fairly young. That scene in the tent is heartbreaking to this day. These events would make anybody feel unstable and to be thrown into a powerful order with insane responsibility. Poor little Annie didn\u2019t deserve this path",

However, I feel that despite his harsh upbringing and early life, he still could have been shaped into an effective Jedi Master had he been trained by someone other than Obi Wan.\n\nObi Wan was a great Jedi and an excellent companion/brother to Anakin, but not so much a mentor. Whether in the prequels or the Clone Wars series, Anakin was often resistant to succumb to Obi Wan's authority and follow his directions. In TPM, young Anakin clearly looked up to Qui Gon as a fatherly/authoritative figure, and I can't help but feel they would have had a more effective master-apprentice dynamic.\n\nFurthermore, Qui Gon was somewhat of an \"unconventional\" Jedi for his time - he questioned the rigidity of the Order and was also more accepting of his emotions, unlike the \"ideal Jedi\" of the era's Order who was told to suppress their feelings. Qui Gon could have shown Anakin how he could harness his troubled, conflicting emotions and helped guide him in this sense. But unfortunately the only one who really cared about how Anakin truly felt was Palpatine - of course Anakin walked right into his arms.\n\nThere was also a really thorough post somewhere about Plo Koon being a perfect fit, but fuck if I can find that now.",

One fault in being traditional in a master position is the opportunity to make and change rules. Instead of accepting Anakins pain as a permanent trait, the masters attempted to do as they always have and teach him to basically \u201cget over it\u201d and let go of attachment. Since most Jedi are trained young their parent child relationship isn\u2019t the same. They are taught early about the Jedis tradition of letting go. Anakin grew with a very loving mother in a struggling setting. Children raised in situations like that often build dependencies and tight bonds with parents. \n\nI agree Qui Gon would have been better match for Anakin because he was known to question the order. He realized the dark side and pain was natural, and for the Jedi to deny the study of suffering was counter productive in the long run. If the Jedi were more educated on the dark side they\u2019d have a better idea on how to fight it. Their belief was to focus 100% on good and anything related to the Sith and dark side was considered forbidden. With more knowledge they might have been able to sense Palpatine sooner.",

Maybe they would have a lot of leftover assets from the Empire, like Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters, even some hidden bases, but they would lack the personnel to fully man them leaving them with a skeleton crew on their ships. \n\nYou could play up the extremism of the group, that even with their small numbers they would die for their leader much in the way that Hux shows that kind of fanaticism. There was the potential to do something different.\n\nBut no, somehow the First Order is the greatest military power and the resistance is just a few dozen people with a few ships. Apparently there is no military force in control of the governing body to defend themselves.",

It had a great plot that lasts the entire movie, instead of constant battles like 3 or to much incoherence like 1. Yes there's some bad lines but it's really no worse than any of the other movies (including the OT).",

I mean he was just a little boy who missed his mom, and a whole group of older people were telling him how that was bad... \n\nI like Luke and the idea of Jedi, but I feel like everyone misses the point. The prequels, sand monologue aside, were about how /bad/ the Jedi order was. Anakin was told to \u201cbury his feelings\u201d and be some robotic solder/police/monk/warrior, and because of that he started lashing out and eventually joined Palpatine. Yoda and Obi Wan lied to Luke about Vader, and even though they were super pacifist and wise, they didn\u2019t think like... having a talk with the guy would help. And then the *same thing* happened with Luke and Kylo Ren; instead of talking with his nephew he did what Jedi were told to do, and then Kylo killed all his classmates and joined Snoke.\n\nFear doesn\u2019t lead to suffering, but burying your feelings do. What makes someone brave isn\u2019t being fearless, it\u2019s doing the right thing despite your fears.  That\u2019s why the Old Jedi Order was bad, that\u2019s why Yoda was wrong (and tells Luke that he messed up), and this is why we need Rey and something new to help the galaxy heal.",

His disassociation is so complete that, mentally, he's two people.\n\nSo when Anakin reaches the point of no return, really he's just pre-suit Vader. Many people only consider him Darth Vader once he dons the suit. He's Vader the second he murders Windu.",

Everyone wants to see the baddies, that\u2019s why they like Vader and Maul and the Emperor. Thrawn could be portrayed almost like the new Joker movie, I think. He has so many layers, and is hyper intelligent and reserved, but at the core is still about conquest and control. Reading the outbound flight and Heir to the Empire series when I was a lot younger, I was so sad to hear they threw out that portion of the expanded universe.",

He killed more men women and children then just the sand people, planets he conquered during his time as sidiouses enforcer, obviously the Jedi temple. Yes he's caused a lot of suffering but damn he had some mental health issues, his mother was tortured and murdered, he was forced to hide his relationship, he was manipulated because he cared about the safety of others, he was manipulated into essentially killing his wife, his body was completely destroyed, and he wasnt once offered therapy. I think he is suffering a bit too. I mean think about it all those people he killed, with his lightsaber. Fatal blows and all. Yeah they may have suffered a few minutes, hours even if they knew he was coming. But Vaders suffering is greater, he lives with it and when he comes back to the light he is under the weight of the fact that he's done all those things. And then dies so I guess that's neat",

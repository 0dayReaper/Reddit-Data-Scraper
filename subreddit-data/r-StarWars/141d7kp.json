I'm a fan of the Last Jedi and I am genuinely curious how people who disliked this portrayal would have done things differently if they had to pick up where JJ Abrams left off and nothing changed about the Force Awakens. Why was Luke gone for so many years? Why didn't he jump at the chance to face the First Order when they revealed themselves?",

            "comment": "He was only gone for a couple years or so, right? Not 20. Otherwise Kylo would've been a toddler when he turned. \n\nBut what I would've done instead was have Luke go searching for answers about why the Jedi always fail, which is why he goes looking for the First Temple (which was mentioned in TFA). Trying to find anything about how the Jedi formed to find out why their teachings and doctrine inevitably lead to collapse time after time. Its the answers he finds that spooks him enough to have an existential crisis about what he's dedicated his life to",

Leia, Han, Chewie and R2 would possess the coordinates and would share them with Rey in TFA after making sure they can trust her. He also wouldn't go all \"ISB Yoda\" mode and would never say \"the time of the Jedi is over\" or smth like this. I mean it's Luke, a guy who was always positive, optimistic, a beacon of hope in the dark times. He'd never give up on someone, not to mention his nephew. And he'd never run away like a coward when his friends need help. \n\nAnother scenario which does fit the original TFA script is where he's just waiting for a worthy apprentice that he has foreseen in his visions. Then Rey arrives, he trains her and they together join the fight against the First order. Luke deserved a bigger role in those movies.\n\nAnd he'd treat his family's legacy(the lightsaber) with the respect it deserves.",

He\u2019s the immovable object to Palpatine\u2019s unstoppable Force.\n \nLuke sacrifices his friendships, his family (Leia, Han &amp; Ben), and his reputation to stay isolated and alone on the edge of space desperately trying to hold back a tide. And he does so gladly.\n\nThen pivot to Luke revealing that in the depths of his connection to the Force he has foreseen the coming on a Jedi, an apprentice. His *last* apprentice he knows.\n\nLuke trains Rey relentlessly over 6 months during the movie, impacting as much knowledge and skill as he can to try and bring her up to Jedi Knight level. He knows they\u2019re working on limited time until Palpatine/Kylo tracks them down (due to Rey\u2019s connection to Ben as a Dyad) or till the FO overwhelms the Resistance.\n\nRey is the one who fights the connection to Ben at first believing there to be good in him but later rejecting him as a monster. Luke is the one who imparts a cryptic \u201cand that is what Kylo is\u2026.but not one of his own making\u201d.\n\nThe FO attack Leia and the Resistance and Luke sends Rey off to help/rescue the survivors while he does an epic force showdown against Palpatine and through him Kylo. Still force projecting, but this time he\u2019s the distraction on the ground while he also manages to accomplish the Holdo manoeuvre on the FO fleet in orbit, severely decimating their offensive forces.\n\nRey manages to rescue the resistance survivors on the salt planet as well as bringing some new Resistance allied ships from the New Republic, now fully onboard after the destruction of Hosnian Prime.\n\nLuke passes into the Force but leaves Kylo with the \u201cbe seeing you around kid\u201d, while simultaneously appearing to Leia &amp; Rey on the Falcon and telling Rey the final truth.\n\nBen didn\u2019t fall to the Dark Side. He was pushed, pulled and dragged by Palpatine. Mind-flayed until what was left is Kylo. A twisted shell of rage and emotion. Not an apprentice or enforcer like Vader for Palpatine but instead a trophy to break Luke and Leia\u2019s spirit.\n\nBut Luke knows the real Ben is still somewhere inside. He heard him whisker when Rey was connected to Kylo. So he gives her the last mission, her last trial to become a true Jedi.\n\nStop Kylo, save Ben, help the last Skywalker Rise\u2026.and together they **will** stop Palpatine once and for all.",

The First Order showed up and started kicking ass because the NR are written to be idiots, the Resistance needed Luke and since Rey and her friends are the main characters it fell to them to complete this quest.   \n\n\nThen who did? You're so actively denying my points without any arguments, it's funny. Since nobody knew where he had gone ( this is why they needed to find the map after all) Luke was the only one who could possible create this map and leave it. If they always wanted to make it look like Luke didn't want to be found there'd be no map at all, I'm feeling uneasy having to explain simplest of things here.   \nThe sequels are as simple as cartoons for 3 yr olds. It's not difficult to follow them at all and I'm not having any trouble with it, you're just making things up in an attempt to defend a subpar movie and a subpar writer.",

More obvious ones would be that he's either training other Jedi in even further seclusion, or maybe he discovered some other greater threat that he needed to contain. \n\nIn retrospective of the Rise of Skywalker, maybe Luke actually learned that it was Palpatine who was mind-fucking Kylo Ren, and he sought the way to break the hold of evil over his nephew?

Once there he spends years immersed in the ancient Jedi texts as well as communing with the force ghosts of Qui Gon Jinn, Obi Wan, Yoda and his father. And then one day a mysterious young girl appears on the island, holding his fathers lightsaber. And he knows this is the force is telling him that its time for the Jedi to return.",

But really it would have been Luke working with and protecting the students that escaped, finding and recruiting other force sensitive students, and explaining why going directly back was too dangerous. \n\nAnd focus on showing how he incorporated the lessons he learned directly from the OT, and how he used those he has access to from the PT into his new Jedi Order.\n\nThis of course instead of nearly beheading his nephew then running off, shutting off from the force, wanting to burn holy books and end the jedi while his friends die and he doesn\u2019t lift a finger, and only at the last possible second does he put on a very slight distraction and promptly dies.",

He should tell Rey what a brat she is, and then train her like Yoda trained him. Then he goes out flying with Han and Leia for old times sake. Small side quest killing a star destroyer or something. Then he gets his epic light saber battle with Kylo, defeats him but does not kill him. Almost bringing him to the right side of the force. There will still be some dark left in him for Mary Rey to force out of him in the end.",

They were still expected to act as Police and Security for the Senate. That's the part of the budget the funding came from.\n\nI do believe the Jedi still held some patents that the order derived income from as well.",

Like the force itself assisted him and whatnot. Probably why Right after Anakin left Watto's business went to shit. \n\nLike just having Force Sensitive people helped out the local communities.",

They could go work on Jedi farmlands like monks, or serve on hospital ships as healers, or join the exploration corp and attempt to find new hyperspace routes, or work as historians and scholars.\n\nWhats overlooked is hyperspace travel is somewhat Force related. The Hyperdrives are reverse engineered from Rakatan Hyperdrives which required channeling the Force to utilize. The dauther civilisation after the fall of the Rakatan eventually reverse engineered Hyperdrives to not require use of the Force, albeit it not as efficiently or effectively. Meanwhile the most successful hyperspace scouts were force sensitive. The Hyperspace lane connecting Empress Tets system to Korroban was discovered by down on their luck Force Sensitive explorers.",

If having a force sensitive merely present is enough to aid an area simply by presence, is there an inherent harm in the Jedi order hoarding the younglings?

Like untrained by adulthood the force leaves them by the time they're adults. \n\nIn the Chiss empire they basically keep their Force sensitive children infantile not learning anything else and they're just painting pictures till they're teenagers and then one day their puberty kicks in and they lose connection to the Force. Darth Vader is pissed off when Thrawn explains he wasn't hiding these children from the Emperor and realizes none of them have any real training to be actual threats.",

            "comment": "**Pre-Clone Wars**\n\nThe Jedi Knights served the Galactic Republic for 1,000 generations. Here's some thoughts:\n\n1. **Government Stipend**. It is likely they were on a stipend for the office of the Supreme Chancellor and part of the normal Republic budget. In the same way that the United States funds the FBI for example, but in this case the Jedi Order acts as a contracted vendor. \n2. **Donations**. In addition, the Jedi Order has members from many different species and cultures across the Galaxy which likely give donations to the Jedi Order in the same way that Fraternal Orders or College Alumni or Buddhist Temples give gifts to the Jedi Temple to keep it running, because their family member was or is a member. \n3. **Asceticism**. The Jedi likely maintain a great deal of their own resources, including growing food in hydroponics bays in the temple and on agri-world colonies across the Galaxy for failed Jedi which keep their expenses and costs down. What do the Jedi really need to spend money on that they can't make, grow, or repair themselves?\n\nAs part of their service the Republic whenever the Supreme Chancellor needs a Jedi to go handle a matter, such as a trade dispute on his behalf he can call up the Council and ask for them to solve the problem. The Jedi Council assigns an appropriate number of Knights and they can ask the Department of Justice to borrow a starship for the mission, and either reimburse them for extraneous expenses or ask for a budget of funds for the mission. The ship, crew, and supplies are thus paid by the DOJ. When the mission is over the ship returns to the DOJ vehicle pool. The Jedi who spent 300 credits on travel and entertainment can fill out a form and get reimbursed by the DOJ if they can justify the expense as part of their job.\n\n**During Clone Wars**\n\nEach Jedi General would have a budget and an entire supply and logistics division to support their army and navy. In addition, the Jedi Order has basically been drafted by the Republic due to the war and are likely bound by ancient law and sworn oath to serve the Republic and in turn, the Republic supplies them to maintain their Army with Jedi special forces and leadership as part of their \"Defense\" budget.\n\nHope that helps.",

I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s necessarily possible to draw real world comparisons because all of our countries have standing militaries, where as the new republic didn\u2019t exactly have an army, so since there is no real word analogy for the Jedi order the explanation can literally be made up by the writers\n\nHere\u2019s how I would do it: Jedi live in the temple so the government funds the temple, which takes care of everything the Jedi need to survive. When they go out on missions as ambassadors or doing recon or  whatever the government pays their bill\n\nSeveral times in the movies they make it clear that the Jedi have almost blind allegiance to the Republic government, so it stands to reason that the government pays them",

    "postText": "Hello fellow Redditors and welcome to what is hopefully the first of many posts from this account.\n\nI guess a bit of an introduction of what I am going for here:  I am a sucker for entertainment. Movies, TV Shows, Music, Sports. You name it. Recently, I began to start keeping track of everything that I have been watching and started to grade/rank each piece of entertainment that I tuned into.  I am a big numbers guy (my real job requires it) so I developed a few weighted average formulas to help calculate a numerical value to help create my rankings for each piece of entertainment. I have formulas made for each episode of TV I watch, album I listen to and also have rankings made for rating TV shows in general, not just on a per-episode basis. I finally feel like I am ready to start to share my opinions and results with the rest of you guys! The number one thing to remember here though is that I AM NOT AN EXPERT. I encourage you all to disagree with me as much as you want or maybe even agree with what I am saying. I want to hear your opinions!!\n\nI found myself recently binging through the entire Star Wars chronological timeline (Disney+ does a really awesome job laying it out for you) and eventually made it to Star Wars Rebels. I honestly even thought about just skipping it over as I wasn't thrilled to start up another multi-season animated Star Wars show, but man I am happy that I did. I am even more happy that I did it considering the upcoming Ahsoka show almost looks like a live-action version of the show. So without further ado, let's dive into the show. Oh, yeah MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Likes**\n\n* First off, this is a show that progressively gets better as it goes on. The first two seasons were definitely weaker than the final two. The whole Inquisitor storyline from season one just felt a bit old and it did take some time for the characters to come into their own a bit. Season 2 definitely has its stronger points, but there are plenty of weaker filler episodes loaded in there as well.\n* The latter seasons really added a much stronger layer of substance to each of the episodes and the introduction of Thrawn as the big bad helped tremendously. The idea of condensing down the fourth season into just 15 episodes instead of 22 was a big win on my end as it helped to take out some of the pointless fluff episodes that added no real impact to the story.\n* As you can see in my episode rankings below, it really ends the series on an incredibly high note with a great final season that really just hones in on what the show had done best over the first couple of seasons. \n* I thought the character development was quite solid overall. Other than Zeb who pretty much stays his brutish self the entire show (which I have no complaints on), all of the other rebels went through some major changes over the course of the series. From Ezra growing into a braver Jedi, Kanan pretty much turning into a god damn wolf, Kallus flipping sides and Sabine juggling her family ties, I was pleasantly surprised with the character development\n* It was great to continuously see characters from the Star Wars universe briefly make appearances in the show to help keep us viewers on our toes. The episodes including the likes Lando, Leia, Hondo and Saw just helped to add a nice old classic Star Wars feel to the show. The rebels' friends they made along the way also reoccurring, especially near the end of the show was also a nice wrinkle.\n* I thought the show was at its best when it really dove into Ezra and Kanan's connection with the force. It almost felt like we were going with Ezra and learning the ways of the force alongside him. The episodes revolving around the temples were all strong in my opinion.\n* In terms of how notoriously bad Star Wars can be for their writing, I thought that this show did a pretty damn good job with it all. It is really essential for animated shows to be strong on this end!\n* I thought the animation was noticeably solid and continued to improve as the series went on\n* Chopper! I mean how can you not like a sassy droid?! AP-5 has his great moments as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gripes**\n\n* Man did I wish we got to see more Darth Vader in this. Season 2 almost felt like such a tease with him. I was planning on him being a major part of the show for the remainder but that was just not the case. This would have been some prime Darth Vader that we would have been able to see\n* There were definitely some pointless filler episodes layered without the first three seasons that just made the show more boring/less enjoyable at times. There were probably about 10-15 episodes in the show that just did not be there.\n* If the show were somewhat realistic, the rebels would all have been dead within the first season lol. Obviously, you can't have that in the show, but it almost just felt too easy for the Rebels at times. Sure one of them would get captured at a time, but then they were all of a sudden able to sneak that person out going like 4 vs 1000. That aspect was probably the most unrealistic part of the show that hampered the plot a bit.\n* Maybe reaching here, but it almost felt like there was just a bit *too much* Lothal for me. Not that they did not at all, but I think it would have been a bit better to spread out the horizons a tad, more but it really wasn't too big of a deal. Essentially the entire 4th season is set on the planet.\n* More Ashoka would have been nice as well. Her character practically fizzled out after the second season.\n* I thought they could have done a bit more with the Hera/Kanan storyline. There was awesome closure with it all, but they pretty much just brushed over their relationship for the first three seasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Top 10 Episodes**\n\nNow let's get onto the fun part, my rankings. A brief note before we begin, due to the way I calculate my numbers, it will be damn near impossible for an episode to get a full 10. I have rated over 250 episodes of TV spanning different genres so far and my highest rating for an animated episode is a 9.2 (Bojack Horseman's Fish out of Water). The significance of the difference of even just a .1 of a decimal place really matters in my rankings. I don't want to go into the exact details of it all, but it takes in account numerous factors including the production of the show, the plot, writing, acting, entertainment factor, substance and much more. I do adjust my formula for animated and unanimated shows. So now for my top ten episodes of the show. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 1) Family Reunion and Farewell (04x15)\n   * Rating: 8.70\n   * The series finale of the show with the Rebels finishing their final attack on Lothal. I thought that it did a bit of a rare job of leaving the audience with questions about the character's future yet in a fitting and closing way\n* 2) Jedi Night (04x10)\n   * Rating: 8.69\n   * The unfortunate demise of Kanan Jarrus\n* 3) A Fools Hope (04x14)\n   * Rating: 8.67\n   * The penultimate episode of the show where the rebels officially launch their final attack on Lothal\n* 4) Twilight of the Apprentice Part II (02x22)\n   * Rating: 8.60\n   * Ezra, Ashoka and Kanan discover secrets of the Sith temple while Ashoka faces off against her old master\n* 5) A World Between Worlds (04x13)\n   * Rating: 8.5044\n   * Rebels goes all Interstellar on our asses\n* 6) Fire Across the Galaxy (01x15)\n   * Rating: 8.50017\n   * Season 1 finale involving Kanan being saved from the Empire and the introduction of Ahsoka and Vader into the show\n* 7) Legacy of Mandalore (03x16)\n   * Rating: 8.44\n   * Sabine and the rebels return to Mandalore to help out and recruit the Wren Clan\n* 8) Twin Suns (03x20)\n   * Rating: 8.42\n   * Maul and Ezra race to Tatoonie to find Obi-Wan\n* 9) Visions and Voices (03x11)\n   * Rating: 8.27\n   * Maul and Ezra head to Dathomir\n* 10) Rebel Assullt (04x09)\n   * Rating: 8.26\n   * The Rebels begin their attack on Lothal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall Rating**\n\n* So I will have two rankings made for the shows I review. The first will be simply the average of each episode rating I gave it. The second will be based on another formula I made that looks at the show as a whole and not on a per-episode basis. This formula takes into account similar aspects of what I look into on a per-episode basis (production, acting, writing) but also looks at aspects such as character development, the balance between the episodes, how complete a show is and more. My highest-rated show currently is Better Call Saul at 9.4. (Don't look too much into that as my top rating, there are TOO MANY shows yet to be reviewed for me to claim that BCS is the best show ever, but it gives a good barometer of what a top-tier show would grade as). \n   * Per-Episode Rating: **7.81**\n      * Season 1: 7.74\n      * Season 2: 7.60\n      * Season 3: 7.82\n      * Season 4: 8.14\n   * General Show Formula: **7.88**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you guys all think. Oh yeah and remember, I am not an expert!",

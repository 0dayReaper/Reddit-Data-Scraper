    "postText": "How should I watch these : Episode 7,8,9 Mandalorian, and Book of Boba Fett, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. My friend said to  watch mandalorian and book of Boba fett before 7,8 9 for timeline reasons, and I only now am deciding to watch Kenobi, which I will watch last to avoid confusion. But about Mando, Boba Fett and episodes 7 8 and 9, what order should i watch those?",

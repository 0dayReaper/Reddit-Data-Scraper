The Rey that was there spent well over half an hour with her over the course of the day (we ran into her a few times). Chewie came out with her too, and they took her around on a little mini-adventure spying on stormtroopers and showing her around the resistance base area with the x-wing and stuff. I can't even imagine what it would have been like to have something like that happen when I was her age.",

If you aren't pretty enough to be a princess, you're out, same with height, weight, hair, facial markers etc. They wouldn't hire someone who didn't look like Rey and they wouldn't allow her outside if she didn't have the makeup, hair and clothes to back it up. Disney is a long standing institution, and their commitment to obsessive detail is, for better or for worse, a marvel to look at.",

They think the James Bond they grew up with is THE James Bond, or the best Doctor was the one they started off watching, or the last Final Fantasy game they played before they hit puberty was THE Final Fantasy game.\n\nTrying to explain that the reason the world looks different now is because *they're* different now is like arguing with a brick wall.\n\nIt's okay to not like something anymore. You grew up! You like different things now! You can't stomach those sweets and you're actually getting real hangovers now instead of those mid-20s \"hangovers\" that you THOUGHT were bad. You tried spinach for the first time in ten years and realized \"holy fuck, this stuff is awesome!\" You're allowed to change, and you're allowed to say \"I don't like Star Wars anymore\" and go watch the things you DO like, or maybe rediscover some things you DIDN'T like but now you relate to!\n\nBut for fucks sakes why would you get angry about that? Devote your time and energy to trying to *change* that? Just move on. Do what you like and avoid what you don't. The chips will fall as they may. The cookie will crumble. It's not a fucking election, you can just move on to a life without the thing you don't enjoy anymore.",

Rey, Finn, Poe  etc are their heroes for this generation.\n\nEvery trilogy has had its flaws, but they were overlooked by that generation, and I'm glad they have a trilogy as their own.",

I asked him if he wanted to try and meet her? (Had seen her stopping to take pictures with kids otherwise would have respected her privacy and just told my son she\u2019s looking for storm troopers). She was INCREDIBLY nice and offered to take a picture with my son. The look on his face was he had met his hero, his best friend, and his future wife all at once. One of the moments that melts my heart at both the innocence of children not to mention the kindness of perfect strangers.",

We would always draw whatever cartoony body the kid wanted, more often than not this ended up being a franchise lego was involved in.\n\nSo of course we got a lot of Star Wars requests.\n\n\"Draw me as Plo Koon!\" or \"Ahsoka\" or \"Captain Rex\"\n\nThey would ask me if I liked Star Wars, and I would say \"Yes.\"\n\nSo they would go on and on about all this deep lore, both from the Clone Wars, and books they read, and anything else they could soak up.\n\nThen I remembered, when I was their age, and I was all about Dash Rendar, and Xizor, and the Clone Emperor, and all this shit that the people that were my age in the 70s/80s were probably like \"What's all this Expanded Universe bullshit?\"\n\nBy the time I stopped working at Legoland, I didn't just \"get it\" I fully appreciate the prequels now. Damn, I can't watch the movies without making fun of them, but they added so much lore to Star Wars, and the people that love them most really really love them.\n\nSo when Force Awakens came out, I went into it knowing full well what path we were headed towards, and I can tell you, just like with the prequels, when these kids who grew up with Force Awakens hit adulthood, it's going to assimilate right into the rest of the lore.\n\nIt's hard to find as many people claiming the prequels \"ruined Star Wars\" anywhere near the levels you saw those kinds of comments back in 2005.\n\nBut the odd thing was, going into it with that mindset really helped me enjoy the new ones more. \n\nWish I could thank all those kids I drew the caricatures of for filling me in on Star Wars lore and helping me enjoy it again.",

Sure, everyone loved Luke Skywalker, despite their skin color or gender, but we've had two trilogies focused on white heroes. I'm a white male, and I'm ecstatic that we have more diverse characters.",

Some people get really butthurt when I say this, but if you put those movies in context to other action/fantasy/scifi movies of the time, it was **super \"PC\"**.\n\nParticularly Leia.\n\nEven up to the 80s, the princesses in adventure movies were literally unconscious in some scenes, helpless, they always screamed for the hero. And the hero sprung to action, beat the bad guy, kissed the girl.\n\nLeia needed a door opened, then grabbed a blaster, and got them out of the firefight. She chose another guy over the hero, and nearly turned him down too.\n\nShe also helped save the guy she was into, and even when she was captured, she turned that around and **killed the biggest crime boss in the galaxy with a fucking chain.** While she was in the traditional, 1980s fantasy movie bikini, instead of fainting while crying \u201csave me Han!\u201d she instead entirely subverted the norm of that situation, and this was **very much on purpose.**\n\nBut because these same people grew up with this movie already existing, they have no idea how **weird** that was for the time.\n\nThis is actually a reason it makes me sad that some people want the representation of Leia in the bikini to vanish. I just think we need to emphasize how iconic that was, that she turned the vulnerability moment in the movie into a power moment. Don't sell the statue of her on the ground next to jabba, sell the statue of her killing jabba, or using the large blaster on the barge. Those moments are badass. Just like she is.\n\nThe people complaining Star Wars today is \u201ctoo PC\u201d seem like if they were the age they are today, in the 70s/80s, they would have been complaining about Leia.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the reddit support. More importantly, if you like my views on this, share them with others. I think it's an important aspect of Star Wars lore/history and princess Leia",

I've had a few rants about the prequels (90% about Anakin's portrayal in E.2 &amp; E.3) when I was younger, but it just seems like so much effort now to bitch about things that are really low on the totem pole of things to bitch about nowadays.\n\nAs I get older, RoTJ looks more loosey-goosey. I really just want to watch the space battle and Luke/Vader/Emperor scenes. I'm not going to go on a rant about it, though.\n\nI'm almost 43. I loved The Clone Wars when it came out, even while thinking TCW movie was a bit silly. The sequels aren't perfect movies, but to me, they're solid Star Wars movies. TLJ was particularly amazing, even though I do agree Canto Bight was a tad long.\n\nI like Rogue One. I like Solo. I like Rebels. I'm probably going to like the Forces of Destiny and Resistance when I get around to watching them. I like The Mandalorian. I like them all, because I ingest them the same way I did when I was a kid, just with more understanding of the adult themes.\n\nYou can't destroy or ruin something that was already made (and Lucas *really* tried with A New Hope; maclunkey!) in this medium, not while we have copies of the original works. If you don't care for the new stuff, that's OK. All your prior dream making materials are there for you to enjoy for the rest of your life. Revel in those, sing their praises to the mountain tops. Just don't try and tear down other's dreams at the same time.\n\nMay the Force be with us.",

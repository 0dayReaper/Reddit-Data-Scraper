    "postText": "I was binging the various wikis and I couldn't find anything for release years of different ships outside the idea that light freighters began production around 56bby.\n\nThe players for my game - we're set around 25bby - were looking into more notable models. I wouldn't mind saying fuck it if the ships are from later in the timeline, but it's still something I was wondering about?\n\nThey're looking at some of the more notable light freighters. Our Trandoshan wants a YV-666, our Bothan is wanting a YT-something (he didn't specify if he wants a 2400 or 1300), and our human is wanting a VCX-100 because she binged rebels last month.\n\nDon't know if I'm flairing right, so please correct me if I'm wrong.",

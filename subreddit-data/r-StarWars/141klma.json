The prose even specifically notes that he constructs a special helmet and gloves to wear when he sleeps so they won't cover his head or hands.

They rereleased *Rule of Two* last year with new cover art and even though it focuses on Zannah, it looks WAY better than the original.",

The issue I have though is that the helmet is incredibly detailed\u2026 but so is the rest of the suit. Instead of the head piece being a center point of the whole outfit, it just gets blended into the mish mosh of random shapes and busy-nonsense. I feel like if you give him some fairly plain black robes, keep the purple waist sash, maybe a black clone wars-esque collar/shoulder piece\u2026 then keep the helmet, you\u2019d have a REALLY good sith outfit. Good rule of thumb with character designs; if you are going to have a complicated centerpiece, keep the rest of the design simple to let the centerpiece work in contrast and draw the eye.",

Legit the helmet from 1 (which is my favorite just to answer the question) or something similar would have worked just as well as that *stupid godawful fucking mask*. 3 is good too but I\u2019d pick 1 (and 2 if the mask was changed to not be shit) over it. So 1 &gt; 2 with changed mask &gt; 3 &gt; normal 2",

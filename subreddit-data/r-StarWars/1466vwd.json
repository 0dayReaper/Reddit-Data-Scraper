    "postText": "Or at least I thought.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nTo summarize, up until this year I've only ever watched movies from the SW universe. I'm almost ashamed to admit that I started watching reaction videos of the Mandalorian, following the story.\n\nI signed up for Mickey Mouse + for season 3\n\nI watched the 3rd season of the Mandalorian and was really hyped at the announcement of the Ashoka series.\n\nI figured I'd better watch all the relevant animated series to learn about her backround/story\n\nSo I went straight to the star wars movies/series timeline they have setup and started with the Clone Wars\n\nClone Wars:  was good but it seemed to have a lot of filler episodes\n\nThe Bad Batch: This was epic, I LOVED THIS SERIES\n\nI'm now currently watching Rebels. I realize that although it takes place after the previous 2 series, the animation style/quality (it looks like an animation where as the Bad Batch looked almost live action at times) leads me to believe it was one of the first animated series.\n\nI was not sure if the difference in animation would hinder my enjoyment.\n\nWell (just one example) I just watched Season 3's \"Twin Suns\" episode last night and just sat there, jaw hanging wide open because of what I had just witnessed (no spoilers)\n\nSo yea, I was wrong, way wrong about the cartoons.\n\nAnd I've never been so happy to be wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Working on clone wars now and will look forward to seeing bad batch etc next. Of course Asoka will be out by the time I finish clone wars (just started season 2 last week). This whole universe is deserving of watch time. Some filler episodes but then you have to remember that it\u2019s nice to just enjoy an action packed adventure that isn\u2019t so serious. Like in rebels there are some side missions that seem random but get tied up later in a non-mandatory sort of way, but still gives you reference and insight to other series in the universe.",

Some episodes certainly are aimed toward children but there is a lot of good episodes in there with a good story.  Fills in a lot of those gaps and just makes the galaxy bigger.",

They actually get angry when animated content is deliberately aimed at adults, like South Park or King of the Hill or Archer. That's why the SW animated shows have gotten some disparagement - like it's not \"real\" Star Wars, or it's all cheese for kids like Droids and Ewoks.\n\nBut the SW animated shows from Clone Wars on are terrific SW content. Personally, I have found Bad Batch to be some of the most compelling and thought-provoking sci-fi drama I've seen in a very long time, approaching Star Trek in its ability to sneak really heavy topics into a half-hour animated adventure show. The storylines are complex, nuanced, and realistic, and the characters are compelling and engaging, but the plain old fun factor hasn't been sacrificed to bring this sophistication into the show.\n\nKeep watching Rebels. Ahsoka isn't a main character, but there are some significant episodes for her in the show and you'll enjoy where her story arc takes her. It also appears from the trailers that the storyline of Ahsoka is essentially a direct continuation of the last season of Rebels, so pay attention to the series finale.",

They aren't very long, so you can blast through those lists no problem without having to sit through 7 whole seasons. CW was made when we still had a lot of flavor-of-the-week style shows, so a lot can be skipped. You could probably do that to some extent with Rebels, too, but it's a tighter, more focused story, so I don't think you could skip nearly as much.",

Star Wars : The Clone Wars is the everlasting proof of that. Just because something is animated in whatever Style *doesnt* mean it's for (or specifically for) children, nor does it mean that it cant have decent writing. People need to get off of their \"Im too old!!\" ego and actually bother to appreciate something for once. Give something a chance *before* you judge.",

            "comment": "listen up mate, because I'm a 1971 vintage too. So much of **modern** Star Wars was *made for us*. \n\nRemember in the late 70s when we had the junior novelization of the movies, and that was it? That the ONLY star wars \"content\" was ONE BOOK to read over and over?\n\n...and it had a few photos in the middle, some of which *weren't even in the movie*?\n\nWell when you happen to be watching The Mandalorian Season 1 Episode 5 and you see Mando sitting on a dewback in ***the exact same camera angle*** as one of those photos that isn't in the movie, you know that the guy behind it (Dave Filoni) is one of us. Mando season 1 is a wish list of the things we wondered back before we even knew what a Sith was. What would IG-88 kicking arse look like? Why did Vader say \"no disintegrations\" to Fett? \n\nIf you're like me, you were turned off by the horrible Clone Wars movie that started the series. Don't be. My boys dragged me into it, it soon gets into not only fleshing out the galaxy but also repairing the continuity.\n\nOur generation's experience gets constant nods. Watch Star Wars rebels and you'll see the origins of the frickin' TIE Defender from the X-Wing game that we played in our college days. The attack shuttle they made up for that game is what the Bad Batch flies around. \n\nDon't be ashamed to jump back in.",

            "comment": "I 3D Printed all the parts of the armor then used them as master copies for my silicone and fiberglass molds. After I made the molds, I slush cast the parts using cold metal casting technique but instead of just covering the outer surface with a dust coat of metal powder, I mixed the metal powder directly into the resin. Mixing the metal powder into the resin causes lots of air bubbles in the mixture, so for a better bond and to avoid any surface imperfections caused by those bubbles, I de-gassed the mixture using a vacuum chamber. After casting the outer surfaces with a few coats of cold cast mixture, I backed up the parts with multiple layers of fiberglass for extra durability and rigidity. When you take the cold casts out of the mold, they have a very dark and dull surface. I applied 7 different surface applications on each part to get an even metallic finish, then polished all the parts with metal polish and buffed them. Since I added the metal powder directly into the resin and backed up all the armor parts with multiple layers of fiberglass, the whole armor weights just a little over 10 kgs / 22 pounds but I really love how heavy it is! It makes you feel like you\u2019re wearing an actual piece of armor :)  \n\n\nFor most of the armor parts and the helmet, I used the 3D models by GreatApeStudio. His models are definitely one of the most screen accurate ones available if you\u2019re looking for The Mandalorian related 3D Models! \n\n  \nThis is the way!!!",

For the bandolier, I took my measurements and created a template and cut strips of leather and glued them together using fabric glue. (I wish I knew how to sew\ud83d\ude05) For the cummerbund, I created a basic template using screen-grabs then cut the shapes from a sheet of leather and glued them on top of fabric then glued the gray leather on top of them and pressed down the crevices to get the details show through. For leather shin wrap, I 3D printed a base then made a silicon mold to cast it out of a flexible material. I ended up casting it in flexible urethane and glued the leather part around it then added the details (like the pouch etc.)",

            "comment": "R1: Anakin, but I'd say Mandalorian-era Luke could probably match him. \n\nR2: S5 Ahsoka had dueled Ventress and General Grievous pretty competently. She also isn't that much weaker than S7 Ahsoka who dueled Maul. Cal's best feats are Rayvis, Dagan, and Bode. He had help with the last two. Inquisitors aren't comparable to Ventress or Grievous. I'd go with Ahsoka still. \n\nR3: Obi-Wan is one of the best Jedi alive during the Clone Wars and defeated Maul and Savage and would shortly defeat Darth Vader Anakin. Kanan get destroyed. \n\nR4: Barriss doesn't really have enough feats to really gauge her too well. Best feat is ambushing Ventress and stealing her lightsabers. Ezra has significantly more feats shown, so I'd go with him.",

I would say there's very few jedi in the lore of Star War's who could best them.\n\nThe only of the list I could see winning their match would indeed be Ezra.",

Yes the attack was a bit unprompted from ventress' pov but still wasnt like \"ohey its my friend, im totally off guard\" Not to mention Ventress fought Anakin, dooku, ashoka, etc. Ventress wasn't some push over.",

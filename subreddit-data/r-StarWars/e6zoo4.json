Loving the feel of the paper and the stories I could follow.\n\nI hope you know you made a lot of people happy with these things and I'm happy to hear you like making them. Please don't feel rushed into making stuff, as you'll never please everyone, but just take some time to appreciate what you're doing.\n\nI mean I can smell the old musty paper of this post. Insane.",

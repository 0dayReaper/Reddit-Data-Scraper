    "postText": "I did think that the force powers were a bit too powerful and it would have been nice to see them taken down a bit, but overall i liked how powerful the force users were and that we got to let loose with them. \n\nFrom what i know, there aren't other games, movies or shows, that show force users being so powerful. The only one that comes close, would be the reborn Darth Sedious in The Rise of Skywalker, when he shoots the lightning. ",

Look at how Stormtroopers are in Rebels (jokes) vs the OT (menacing but not too dangerous) vs Fallen Order (capable of being a serious threat). Or compare the Jedi in the 2D Clone Wars cartoon to the 3D one to the prequels (and then to the OT if you really want).",

But I wouldn't want to see a movie where every Force user had that kind of power, because I just don't think it would translate well. It's hard to take characters that feel like gods and make their struggles still be relatable",

And I hope we see a return to games taking chances outside of canon material. \n\nEveryone\u2019s insistence on things being canon and wanting to expand the story is a double edged sword. On one hand it *does* help expand the lore of Star Wars and it is nice to have a timeline.\n\nHowever it stifles the ability to create the truly wild and \u201cX-Treme\u201d stuff from the 90\u2019s and early/mid 00\u2019s. Gimme a new Demolitions, Super Bombad Racing, or Force Unleashed. Cut loose, get wacky, it don\u2019t matter if it breaks canon if you don\u2019t have to worry about it even tying in to canon.",

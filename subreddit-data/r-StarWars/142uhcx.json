But my guess would be that it was because they pivoted to make the season a more definitive ending to the show, while tying into rebels and setting up for bad batch.",

            "comment": "With limited time and budget they picked the arc that set up the spinoff, one of the arc that gave Ahsoka a relatively stand-alone story, and the finale.\n\nI'm not sure why in particular they picked the Martez sisters for Ahsoka over the Sith Temple arc but I can make some guesses (it's more focused on her and highlights her absence from the Jedi better). But those are guesses.\n\nCrystal Crisis is great but my guess is that since it already exists in animatic form they felt it would be a waste to double up on it. Boba vs Cad was a sidestory about minor characters and is hard to justify in a very limited episode order.",

The Bad Batch wasn't going to be cut because they came up with an interesting premise to follow it. Ahsoka's arc never was going to be cut because it's absolutely essential to establish her position in the finale. And the ending wasn't going to be cut because it's the finale.\n\n&gt;\tI definitely would\u2019ve preferred nyx over the Martinez sisters.\n\nHe was cut because you've seen Nyx a million times already in Star Wars.",

I have a feeling why so many of these episodes didn\u2019t make it was because of Disney not filoni",

    "postText": "Recently started watching rebels. Gotta say that after finishing season 2, I think the obi wan series is an entire waste. Before, the only part of kenobi i enjoyed was at the end when obi wan confronts Anakin face to face. But after seeing that this exact same thing (minus the voice device glitching) happened before between Vader and Ashoka, Kenobi the series has no value to me. Why did they do this? Also sorry to be a hater, but I honestly feel that Kenobi could have been a much better series.",

She needed confirmation that Vader really was Anakin (she knew in her heart, but wasn't ready to accept it).  She sees It's Anakin, says she won't leave him, and he tries to kill her.  \n\nIn Kenobi there's a bunch more involved.  Obi-Wan knows this is Anakin, so the scene is about Obi-Wan letting go of Anakin as well as all the shame and pain of having failed him, of not being able to save his brother, and is also the culmination of his journey in the series of healing from his trauma from Order 66.  We get two very powerful and very different character moments from two scenes that on the surface are very similar.  \n\nIt was too good an opportunity for storytelling not to reuse with Obi-Wan.  I suspect if they had known they would make Kenobi they would have saved it specifically for that moment.",

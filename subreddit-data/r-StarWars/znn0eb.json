Not saying he has no investment in the character, both personal investment over the character he originally portrayed and an artistic commitment to doing something meaningful and enjoyable. But he's just not going to have the same mindset or feelings as the most passionate fans, and might even be somewhat professional and distant from the whole thing. So \"SEE HE FEELS THE SAME WAY ABOUT LUKE THAT I DO\" is kind of begging the wrong questions.",

Maybe a scholar of the Sith begins to corrupt him. Rey is Luke\u2019s star pupil. Luke is betrayed by Ben at end of Episode VII.

I think Disney wants their directors to be competent and reliably profitable, but also interchangeable. Putting a trilogy together under a single director would give a ridiculous amount of creative control for just one person. The risks are of course obvious, but I mean imagine the fallout if you gave the trilogy to a single director, and it actually turned out really good? That person could be seen as the new George Lucas. Think of the money that person negotiate for future projects.\n\nAs it is there's really no one person that can be said to be the head of this franchise like Lucas was- Kathleen Kennedy maybe, as a corporate figure.\n\nSo the trilogy is treated like an improv session between two very different directors. Either director probably could have made a better trilogy. But instead we ended up with an incoherent mess that'll probably be completely forgotten in a couple years.",

Like I could have bought the Palpatine returns thing and enjoyed it if it'd been part of a unified narrative we pieced together from the start.",

I don't really have much desire to ever watch the sequels again. Nor the TV shows (I did watch Obi-Wan which had some good moments but was mostly bad). The enthusiasm is just gone for me.\n\nI hope that Mark is happy with the work he did with Star Wars even if he wasn't pleased with how Luke was portrayed in VIII/killed off. I certainly didn't care for it myself but it doesn't make me think any less of Mark, and it doesn't make me care less about Luke in the original trilogy.

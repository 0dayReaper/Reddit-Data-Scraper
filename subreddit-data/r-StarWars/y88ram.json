I didn't actually do mine, my grandma did it way back when it came out, but making Star Wars puzzles and framing them has become a bit of a tradition over the years for me and her.\n\nThis puzzle is the smallest and simplest one we have but is by far one of my favourites.",

So, she began tugging at it and was able to start sliding it out. \n\nShe got caught by a couple of the employees as she had it partially out of the backlit frame. It was two girls and one of them said: \"Please take it. We are tired of hearing the boys argue over who is going to take it home.\"\n\nIt is hanging in my son's room now.",

Chronological order is fantastic for putting yourself into the setting and seeing how the story flows. The episode 5 and 6 split with prequels is a specialty for fans who want to see the original release with the context of the prequels inserted after the big episode 5 reveal.\n\nEdit: I now have a response telling me how bad chronological is and a response telling me how bad release order is.\n\nWe just need 1 more person to chime in and tell us why Machete order is trash to prove we are real Star Wars fans who hate the films enough.",

It's a big time commitment, but it makes Anakin's fall more impactful. I would say have people watch seasons 1-6 of *The Clone Wars* between Episodes 2 and 3. Then, have them watch Episode 3,  followed by season 7 of *The Clone Wars*. That way you get all the surprises from within the movie, followed by the context that the series adds with season 7. Honestly, season 7 fixes most of the problems with the prequels, and he's probably single-handedly responsible for my revived enthusiasm for Star Wars.",

It's 2022, if they haven't watched Star Wars yet with it's wild popularity and availability, you are either talking to somebody who is not going to be very into sci-fi or they are young.\n\nLet the films stand for themselves before telling people they have to watch 6 seasons of a cartoon for it to be worth anything. If people don't enjoy the films, season 1 of clone wars would ensure they never watch star wars again.\n\nI'm saying that as a massive fan of Clone Wars, Rebels, Bad batch, etc",

I'm a big fan of fantasy settings and seeing their timeliness displayed.\n\nThe chronological watch really helps me appreciate the fall of the Republic and the transition of power to the Empire. A favorite element of mine that is made apparent to the watcher is the decline in technology brought on by the dominance of the Empire. As people watching the fantasy movie, we know the lower tech availability and scrapy looking technology from the original films is because of the limitations of the film makers back in the day. As a story element in the Star wars setting we are watching the drain of resources caused by the Empires hoarding materials for economic/military control.\n\nI guess I've watched the movies so many times in each order, it would be hard for me to find it jarring. So I'm biased due to being immersed in it for too long.",

It's pretty important overall, but if you're somehow going in completely fresh to SW, it spoils a pretty major plot point for the rest of the prequels, mainly&gt;! the identity of the phantom menace (palpy).!&lt;\n\nTrust me, my friends had more fun when they slowly started to realize that guy wasn't who he said he was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the midichlorian stuff is obv super important, but it's such a hard pill to swallow for fresh inductees. They had more fun thinking it was a standard magical prophecy; but after the whole thing is watched, then you can go in and be like \"watch the phantom menace, because it's actually all about cells in their bodies\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQui-gon especially is super important for just the one movie he's in, but if you're guiding your friends, it's really easy to go \"okay, so obi wan's master, before his death at the hands of the coolest guy you haven't seen yet, is the one that wanted luke to be trained in secret against the wishes of the jedi council. Why? Because he had advanced knowledge of the prophecy and knew Anakin was important. He also learned how to become a spooky force ghost\"",

Not that a teaser poster is the most important thing in the world, but think about the feelings you have looking at it.  Why is it important?  It's because you already know who Anakin/Vader was before you see it.  You know what he did, and you know what it cost him before dying as a man who would recall this little boy.  The rest of the movies are the same way. Context is important.  They were MADE in release order, exclusively by people who'd seen them in release order.  The parts under the surface only come together properly that way, and \"which spoiler is which\" discussions are a superficial red herring.\n\n[puts on snarky Gen X dad-cap] Also, good luck getting anyone to stick with the franchise after starting with TPM and AOTC.",

Until then Anakin is a hero who always pulls through no matter what and that's what it feels like until the final battle. Then suddenly the legs are gone, he's burning up, goes into some suit, and the movie's over. It's like the end of Infinity War.\n\nI watched it with someone in 2005 who didn't know anything about Star Wars and she cried after Episode III. There was another person here who did the same [whose son strongly identified with Anakin and was emotionally broken at the end](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/vfwyap/your_kids_have_never_seen_star_wars_in_what_order/id0cnzr/):\n\n&gt;As I mention in another comment, be careful if you do this with a kid that is younger. I let my son watch them when in chronological order when he was 8ish (maybe earlier than I should have), and he got really attached to Anakin since he seemed to be a similar age in the first one. He was in denial while Anakin was teetering on the edge of the dark side (he was pulling a trick!), and when it became clear what was happening, it emotionally broke my son. That was really hard to come back from.\n\n\nSo it does remove the WOW reveal in Episode 5, but it has an emotional hit that you don't get if you watch the original series first. I guess the order also depends on the person's disposition to be attached to Anakin.",

The Jedi Council telling him they sense fear in him should have been fleshed out more, explaining the reasons why the Jedi feared to train him which also leads to his constant mistreatment by them. \n\nThe Jedi Council having valid fears that also become a self fulfilling prophecy would have worked really well. I think that was somewhat the idea with Yoda saying they've lost their ability in the force and so on but they never quite got there.",

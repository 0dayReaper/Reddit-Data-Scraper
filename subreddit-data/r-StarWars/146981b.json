Canon was broken up into tiers back then, with G-Canon (George Canon) at the top, tv canon next, then comics books and games last. It was that way to resolve plot discrepancies between media when new stories would come out (like the Clone Wars) that retconned old stories. Wookieepedia even has a quote on the \"Canon\" page directly from George saying exactly this.",

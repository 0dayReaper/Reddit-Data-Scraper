It would have likely re-worked the fundamental conflict between Luke and Vader\n\nPadme didn\u2019t even have a name before 1999 when TPM came out. The only thing we knew about her was that she was dead and, according to the ROTJ novelization, married to Anakin.",

Nothing changes huh?",

You think Goerge would have had bro and sis making out if he had the details nailed down??? He was lucky to get one movie to start!\n\nI love Padme and would like to see more of her story told, but you can't fault George for not having a functional crystal ball to see the future!",

He was already aware that she was his sister and he was actually asking her about his own mother without her realizing it. Leia had no Jedi training at that point but she was already showing her connection with the force by experiencing those kinds of visions that would allow her to feel that her mother was caring but very sad. Connections related to her time in the womb or in the few moments she had with Padme the day she was born. \n\nThis scene right here; \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKlAj5YcAjE",

And feelings.\n3) Then she say that her mother was very beautiful but seemed sad. My interpretation is that this is a follow up of 1 and 2. She can see from the images, that she was beautiful but seemed sad. And those images awaken feelings.\n\nI don't remember my grandmother. She died when I was 6, 30 years ago. We've got pictures of her. She's old, and her hair is white. But she has this crazy smile, that make me laugh \ud83d\ude02. My parents tell me, that she had this very special almost manic laugh, that she couldn't control. People loved her for that laugh. \n\nMy point is, that my explanation of my grandmother would be the same as Leias explanation of her mother. I only remember the images. They make me happy, because of things I've been told.",

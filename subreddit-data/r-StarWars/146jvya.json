The first trilogy is out of print in trade paperback and hardcover, while the second trilogy is not yet available in mass market paperback. You can try to find older prints of the first trilogy used, but it's a crapshoot on what kind of condition they'll be in.",

That being said darth bane trilogy is great and isn't impacted at all by events in the trilogies set around the original movies. \n\nYou can read and watch rebels at the same time if you want, I think Thrawn will have more of an impact if you've read the books already but it's not a huge deal, I watched rebels before I read the books. Heir to the empire trilogy is a must read though, imo it is the greatest Star Wars content out there. Then you have the \"Thrawn\" trilogy which shows his come up in the empire, and has a lot of anakin and Vader in it, then the ascendancy trilogy which is all about his homeworld and ties up some loose ends from the Thrawn trilogy which I ended up really enjoying. \n\nI think zahn is a phenomenal writer so I enjoyed all of them. His characters are deep and true to the original movies. Just make sure you start with heir to the empire. Lastly, highly recommend the audio books, they're very well done.",

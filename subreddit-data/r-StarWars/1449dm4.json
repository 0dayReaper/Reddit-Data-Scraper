It gives you a glimpse into a characters mindset before ever seeing them. \n\nA fighter with a bone to pick might get a metal looking cybernetic leg that improves their combat ability akin to a Grievous/ Maul. Someone at peace can get one like Luke that behaves just like his normal arm and even restores feeling into the limb.",

Especially since prosthetics are so good at that point, it's barely noticably different from a real hand.  \n  \nThe other person is like (paraphrasing) \"Sure, if you're a Jedi Grandmaster living on a core world, with political connections and a ton of resources... as opposed to some poor farmer who got roped into helping bandits and now has to make due with whichever spare parts he can get from the local Jawa\"... which Luke concedes that, yeah, that's a fair point.",

Space is really, quite unfathomably vast.\n\nBut if you're traveling at high speed, hitting *something* with your ship is catastrophically lethal. Similarly, getting too close to a large gravity well is also bad for your ship; it mucks with the hyperdrive and shreds your ship apart.\n\nSo you need clear lanes to travel, where you know you're unlikely to hit anything. Sure, you can jump to hyperspeed and go any direction you want, and you can hide there, or you can jump to escape from some Imperial cruisers, get your bearings, and then jump somewhere else to safety, but if you go far enough or if you do that often enough, eventually you're going to hit something.\n\nIt's a gamble. \n\nYou don't want to find yourself adrift in space if your hyperdrive fails, so you want to arrive close enough to a planet or somewhere you can land and take refuge or make repairs if needed, but you also don't want to land too close or that will kill you.",

As a parallel, from my experience writing and reading DND settings, a lot of creators think Big Numbers Good when writing their eras, so you'll have ancient eras set 10 or 20 thousand years ago... that look nearly identical to the modern era. Language hasn't changed, ancient texts and tomb inscriptions are still readable by modern readers, and maybe technology has only shifted by \"in those days, crossbows weren't invented, and people thought the planet was flat!\"\n\n\nIt's bad and ahistorical logic, but I think when you look at the real world and realize that 2023 and 1943 are basically *completely different **settings***, it makes sense why people don't make thousand-year differences actually seem as strong. I know that King Arthur would be completely unintelligible to a zoomer, but I'm not going to have a vampire monologue in Olde Englishe, and I'll look the other way when a spaceship from 20,000 BBY somehow looks better than the Millennium Falcon",

Not all Empire stuff did, but that was the Galactic Speed Limit. The Millennium Falcon of course went like 0.8, and the Death Star was something like 3.5 which is why the end of the movie was allowed to happen.",

He spends a while looking like a damaged terminator (half his face is cybernetic), but Vader has him repaired and his new prosthetic coverings include even an apparently functional eye (or at least one that looks like a normal eye while allowing the cybernetic eye behind it to still function). So I'd say that's even more advanced than Luke's hand, which doesn't need to do anything as complex as match facial muscle movement.\n\nhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beilert_Valance#Servant_of_Vader\n\nAlthough we only see him in comics. It'd be interesting/a good touch if in motion, the newly prosthetic side of his face looked like someone with partial facial paralysis, or some botox or something. Not quite as fluid as the true organic side.",

Depends on what kind of eat you're getting but I once spent $34,000 on a single leg. (well, my health insurance did)\n\nRegardless of how advanced their technology is, the part that attaches to the residual limb is going to have to be formed to that specific person.\n\nThat means extra, on site labor (or travel)\n\nI'd guess shipping a remade chair is cheaper than a fully cybernetic leg and the specialists to have it fitted.\n\nThen there's the care afterwards if an infection or sore develops...

They usually had lots of leather and stuff to fit it as close as they could to the limb.\n\nBut even a millimeter off in an area extremely noticeable. It's like having a massive stone in you're shoe, except you can't just stop to take it out.\n\nAlso, every time my prosthetic leg has started not to fit well (because my residual limb shrunk or I lost weight) my phantom pain has gotten worse, from having the weight bearing on the wrong spot.",

I don't know about the Star Wars universe, but in real life you can't fit a prosthesis until the wound is healed.  I don't think it's unreasonable that there's no bacta tank available and/or he can't afford the time it would take to heal in one.  So the leg has to heal before he can get a prosthesis.",

The Empire could also have placed a moratorium on these kinda procedures as a means of controlling the propulation - totalitarianism has pretty bad health care, life is cheap, but everything has a price if youre willing pay a potentially faustian price",

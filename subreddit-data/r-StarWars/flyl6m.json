Apart from the tremendous casting, and the fact that we get to see Ahsoka Tano(!!!!) live action, I wonder what this means for Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and GA Thrawn. He'd be close to the same age as he was in Heir to the Empire. \n\nI posted a similar thought on the Mando subreddit, but I'm guessing Sabine's history is tied to how Moff Gideon acquired the Darksaber. \n\nAlso I'm so happy S2 won't be delayed by the Coronavirus. I needed this news today. Its been a rough week.",

It makes more sense for Ahsoka to play a role than Luke. Especially because Filoni is on the project. It remains to be seen how good the makeup will look, but I'm stoked either way. I love Rosario.",

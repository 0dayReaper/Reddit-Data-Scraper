Stuff like The Clone Wars and r/PrequelMemes were a big part of that\n\nEdit - I misspoke, r/PrequelMemes started up not long after TFA came out, but at that point there was still a lot of hype around the ST since TLJ hadn't come out yet. And the memes were already starting to be a thing before the subreddit, if I remember correctly.",

I wish we saw more of him in the Expanded Universe.\n\nHe was one of our very first Inquisitors, after the Grand Inquisitor, though (pre/porto Mara Jade) Lady Lumiya from 1981 is is retconned as being the first seen &amp; named Inquisitor, though the Inquisitorius itself was created in 1989.\n\nI was a very small cog of West End Games but I can take some credit for parts of the ISB.  \n\nI created the Spy Template which was used for Garindan from A New Hope. \n\nI also set the number of TIEs (72) in a Star Destroyer and the numbers of Stormtroopers in a Legion.   I made Dengar be a rival of Han Solo.  I named many of the lesser known Imperial Officers including General Romodi who we catch a glimpse of in A New Hope and is much later used in Rogue One. \n\nLater on a Decipher for the card game I got to name three ships in Death Squadron (the Tyrant, Conquest &amp; Stalker) and one Colonel Wullf Yularen.   That was a big one years later.",

At the conclusion of Episode III, the Lars family seems very warm towards Obi-Wan. Granted they raise Luke to be a farmer, but there\u2019s clearly something that strains their relationship such that Owen wants Luke no where near Obi-Wan. \n\nIt\u2019s also apparent that Luke clearly knows Obi-Wan in Episode 4. It comes off like it\u2019s been awhile since he\u2019s seen him, but you can tell he\u2019s not some stranger or some rumor. I think this is further reinforced by how quickly Luke goes off with Obi-Wan after his adoptive family is killed. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see those interactions.",

Mando and Boba spent the first two episodes of their shows getting dunked on, and Boba was never the same guy who killed like 50 storm troopers when he guest-starred in Mando. \n\nIn Obi-Wan's case, it could make some sense. He could be so jaded/damaged from everything that has happened to him that it affects his ability to connect with the force. The show could showcase his path back to inner peace and end with him finally being able to commune with Qui-Gon.",

Not only with Kenobi struggling with the destruction of the Order, not only the fall of Anakin, but then to be hunted by his own brothers and sisters.\n\n When they do cross paths, I really just want that dynamic of not only the idea of a \"worthy adversary\" in the minds of the Inquisitors, but also a bit of...shame? Fear? They go by their numbers and new identities as Inquisitors now, it will be interesting for them to come face to face with the \"ideal\" Jedi Master all of them aspired and failed to be, and one who knows their names, past identities, strengths and weaknesses, etc. Idk, I really am interested to see what they come up with.",

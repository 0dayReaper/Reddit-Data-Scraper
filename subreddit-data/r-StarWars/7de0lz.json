Though he seems to be pretty strategic about it, so that it is less noticeable. He might do it in mid or long shots when he's talking. In close up, he'll blink when he shifts his whole gaze, like from in front of him to his left. He'll also casually blink in reaction shots where he has nothing to say. He only stares when he needs to, such as close up dialogue in intense moments. And so naturally that is all you remember. I didn't consciously notice him blinking until now. Mind you, I did not notice Rogue One Tarkin not blinking either.",

I wouldn't be surprised if the young Kurt shots cost a couple million dollars all by themselves.  \n\nBut that shit was flawless and 100% worth it.  I'll be impressed to see what they can do in the future with mocap and digital overlays of actors.  ",

It's hard to think people will be receptive of new actors playing characters we've associated with other actors for decades. \n\nBut then again, that's what happened with Obi-Wan Kenobi. Ewan McGreggor did an amazing job and I honestly think he might be more of an Obi-Wan than Alec Guinness in some aspects. We've seen more Ewan Kenobi than Alec Kenobi, but yet we still associate the character as an old teacher.\n\nAnother thing is that we've seen a young Han Solo before. The original trilogies featured an young enough Han Solo and that the idea of an even younger Han Solo is kind of weird. What more is there to flesh out for the character? \n\nI'm skeptical but also welcoming. I've never been super critical of any Star Wars direction and even enjoy the prequels for what they are. ",

Since we saw Han in his early 30s, unless the actor looks extremely like Harrison did, the movie is going to feel off for me, and more like a reboot.",

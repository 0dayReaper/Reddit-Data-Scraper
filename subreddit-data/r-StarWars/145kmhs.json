There's literally at least half a dozen arcs they never got to finish, some of which are very integral to the story.\n\nLike without Son of Dathomir you have no idea how Maul goes from being tortured/Captured by Sidious to being back on Mandalore.\n\nAnd the entire conflict between Boba and Cad Bane in BOBF is based on an unfinished arc that featured the two.\n\nThere was also Dark Disciple which resolves Ventress' story.\n\nYes two of these got adapted into a comic and a novel but it means the show itself is incomplete if You're forcing the audience to switch to an entirely different medium to get the full story",

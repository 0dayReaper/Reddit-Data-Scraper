One of those throwaway lines that got more complex when the prequels came out for sure, but they made it work. \n\nI imagine younglings are far more impatient and reckless than many padawans as well, being younger and less mature. \n\nAlthough in the prequels Yoda had the line that padawans and even the more experienced Jedi had become overconfident (ie: reckless) with their ability. \n\nHim being hesitant to train Luke for those reasons makes a ton of sense.",

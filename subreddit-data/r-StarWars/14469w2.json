            "comment": "Opposite for me. There\u2019s a depth and attention to detail in the script of Andor that I found incredibly engaging. I was never bored, even during rewatches. The prequels have some flashy visuals, but not a lot of thematic depth. Andor feels more like ANH/ESB (the original versions, not the SE\u2019s) in tone and presentation than just about any of the other stuff (Rogue One excepted).\n\nIt may more a function of what your exposure to Star Wars originally was. I was raised on the OT, so Andor feels more like \u201cStar Wars\u201d than anything I\u2019ve seen since.",

That's so interesting, because I had the exact opposite reaction to it. To me, Andor feels the least like Star Wars than anything else we've seen on screen, simply because it seemed to so deliberately eschews both the visual and thematic trappings of Star Wars.\n\nMay I ask, no judgement or tone intended, what was it about Andor that struck you as being so Star Wars-y?",

The emphasis on Jedi in the prequels and other media makes for a very narrow range of situations and outcomes, at least for me. It starts to feel incredibly repetitive. \n\n\u2014the central theme of rebellion and resisting an oppressive regime; small groups of rag-tag citizens rising up to fight in what feels like a hopeless struggle. \n\n\u2014the Empire portrayed as competent or menacing, as opposed to more cartoonish or mustache-twirling. \n\n\u2014minimal campiness. It wasn\u2019t until ROTJ that Lucas really leaned into the camp aspect of Star Wars. The Special Editions went back and inserted a bit more of that style into ANH/ESB (mostly ANH), but before then the humor of the prequels (Jar Jar\u2019s antics, stuff like 3PO\u2019s head getting stuck on a battle droid, etc.) felt quite different than that of ANH/ESB. Sure, there were witty one-liners and some awkward moments, but overall the story took itself seriously. The humor of the prequels seems less about serving the story and more about clumsily trying to evoke a laugh from the audience. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cdeliberately eschews both the visual and thematic trappings of Star Wars\u201d without examples. I find Andor to be incredibly similar thematically and visually to what we got in ANH. Those two stories very clearly coexist in the same universe: the architecture/design of all the ISB spaces plainly evoke the typical Imperial aesthetic seen in the Death Star and Imperial starships; uniforms of Imperial soldiers/officers is entirely consistent with the OT-era; the brutalist architectural design of Coruscant feels consistent with Empire-era sensibilities; the culture and design of Ferrix slots very easily into what we know of the Star Wars universe; some of the wealthy/high-society types in Andor wear clothing that is inspired by a Jedi-chic design, which feels \u201creal,\u201d like an avant-garde stylistic statement.",

Some of the other story threads got me through it but most of his screentime feels like busywork.  What he does prompts the actions of the other characters, but the nuts and bolts of it could happen off-screen.  I will say that by the last episode things tie together and build enough momentum that I'm actually looking forward to s2 despite being lukewarm on s1.",

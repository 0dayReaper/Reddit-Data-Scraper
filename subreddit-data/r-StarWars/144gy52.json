    "postText": "My favorite Star Wars book series may actually come to life with \u201cHeir to the Empire\u201d being put together by Dave Filoni. This series takes place after Endor. \n\nCan he recast Luke, Leia, and Han?  Will Star Wars fans not freak out at the change? \n\nFor example:\nLuke played by Sebastian Stan \nLeia played by Joely Fisher or Olivia Coleman \nHan played by Alden Ehrenreich (Solo) or Jamie Costa or maybe John Krasinki\n\nExtra:\nMara Jade by Jessica Chastain or Karen Gillan\nLando played by Donald Glover (returns from \u201cSolo\u201d and upcoming TV show).\n\nThoughts?",

And I honestly hope Han, Luke, and Leia play minor, minor roles, if they're AT ALL, in Filoni's film.",

That is why the New Republic didn't consider the First Order a real threat as they saw it simply as a remnant of the Empire that was fading away. If there was a large scale Imperial conflict post-Battle of Jakku I would think the New Republic would have taken the First Order far more seriously.",

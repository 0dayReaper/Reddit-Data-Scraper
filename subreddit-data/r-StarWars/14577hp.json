It specifically describes the surface as glass.\n\n&gt;I do have one comment to make to any armchair strategist who has never made a drop. Yes, I agree that the Bugs\u2019 planet possibly could have been plastered with H-bombs until it was surfaced with \nradioactive glass.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, a few paragraphs later Starship Troopers also talks about the Nova Bomb, a nuclear planet killer, well before it appears in Halo.\n\n&gt;So suppose we did ruin the productive surface of Klendathu? They still would have ships and colonies and other planets, same as we have, and their HQ is still intact \u2014 so unless they surrender, the war isn\u2019t over. We didn\u2019t have nova bombs at that time; we couldn\u2019t crack Klendathu open. If they absorbed the punishment and didn\u2019t surrender, the war was still on.\n\nIf you take out the necessity of orbital bombardment, a lot of nuclear war stories after WW II discussed nuclear war resurfacing significant portions of the Earth, making it uninhabitable.\n\nFurther taking out the resurfacing and just orbital bombardment to make a planet uninhabitable,  Raymond F. Jones 1952 \"This Island Earth\" (made of three short stories that were earlier published years earlier) has an intergalactic war where bombardment of a planet using meteorites to make it uninhabitable is a staple tactic of the Guarra.\n\nFinally, James Blish's \"A Clash of Cymbals/The Triumph of Time\" in 1959 references a Beth\u00e9 blaster that creates a nuclear fusion reaction that vaporizes the target and is used to destroy planetary surfaces, if you want to use a beam / energy weapon for planetary bombardment.\n\nStill, not using the exact term \"Glassing\" though.  Though the concept of glassing was around in different variations, the term \"Glassing\" itself is more recent than the books I mentioned.",

Within military circles, \"glassing\" is sometimes used as slang for using nuclear weapons, particularly in reference to desert areas. Glassing also has several meanings within military slang, so context during use is important (also used as a reference to spotting an enemy through an optical device such as binoculars).\n\nWhile there are descriptions of activities that would \"glass\" a planet in many scifi series (Dune, Lensmen as examples), the term \"glassing\" is not actually used to describe the activity. However, the term \"glass\" to reference destruction of a planet's surface does show up in chapter 10 of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers in 1959.\n\n*I do have one comment to make to any armchair strategist who has never made a drop. Yes, I agree that the Bugs\u2019 planet possibly could have been plastered with H-bombs until it was surfaced with radioactive glass.*\n\nHowever, \"glasses\" is said aloud during dialog in the 1997 Starship Troopers movie:\n\n[\"Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the planet, MI mops up.\" - Lt Rasczak](https://youtu.be/ZBgqiCC2UMk?t=111)\n\nedit: formatting\n\nedit2: Please refer to /u/TheNthMan [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/14577hp/comment/jnkpzk2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for some additional great info on glassing as a term.

There's no reason for infantry to \"mop up,\" after a planet has been glassed, in current parlance. I strongly suspect that the line from the movie inspired the term in the Halo novels though. But at some point the term has shifted from a large bombardment to utter annihilation, and I do think Halo was the first to use the latter meaning.",

I'm no expert in planetary formation or geophysics, but I'm pretty sure it would take a lot longer than that, probably more like on the order of hundreds of thousands or millions of years, to properly return to a relatively spherical shape *at least*.\n\nThe real impossibility here is that the rest of the surface doesn't look like Mustafar.

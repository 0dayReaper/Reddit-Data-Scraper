There is a reason Lucas started with this film.\n\n(Honestly, if you go chronologically you will not have the same understanding, attachment and/or viewpoint of the characters. For example, you\u2019ll be like who tf cares about this kid? Or why is this green goblin and Sam Jackson making these bad decisions etc.)",

    "postText": "Does anyone know when and where the first mention (canon or not) of a black kyber crystal was? i know we have the introduction of the dark saber in 2010 in s2 of the clone wars, but i also know a black kyber crystal existed and could be used in the first force unleashed game in 2008, which acted the same as the dark saber with the black base color and white outline making it look almost 2-D, it brings up the question, atleast to my knowledge of the crystal, was the inspiration behind the dark saber being a black kyber crystal inspired by the first force unleashed game?",

            "comment": "So far there's no indication of black kyber existing outside of assumption that this is the reason why Darksaber is black.   \nHowever there's no way to make a final statement on this, because you still can change the lightsaber color without changing the focusing crystal - see now the last season of Clone Wars, so it's possible that something else turns the Darksaber black instead of the crystal.   \nAs to inspirations, hard to tell. Maybe it was through the FU cosmetics. TOR also had black-cored lightsaber options. But the history of edgelords is not limited to Force Unleashed, so it's not impossible that the \"radical black lightsaber\" was just an idea floating in the air during the development.",

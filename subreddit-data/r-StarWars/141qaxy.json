It starts off with the 2008 movie and then the tv show. The movie isn't the best and the first season or two are rocky, but later on when it hits the show REALLY HITS. High praise from everyone, it comes with a \"will make you cry\" guarantee if you finish it.",

Also to add on to why The Clone Wars specifically, because it is kinda a foundation for characters and ideas. Rebels builds off of TCW, The Bad Batch continues directly after TCW, the Mandalorian has more ties to it the more it goes on and I don't even need to mention the Ahsoka series. \n\nThough it's not everything, Resistance, Obi-Wan and Andor don't have TCW ties.",

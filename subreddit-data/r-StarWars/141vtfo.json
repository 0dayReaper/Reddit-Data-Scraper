And Rey pretty much has books and that's it for for teaching and institutional infrastructure. A Luke Force Ghost would also echo Obi Wan's aid to Luke in RotJ but for Rey, the new generation. \n\n\nWhile I dislike how little Luke was used in the ST, I'm not mad at moving the heroes to a new generation.",

The message os no longer \"through discipline and effort you build skill and achievement\". Now it's \"you're already enough, you were born perfect, no need to work on yourself, the world owes you your dreams\"... which is an overcorrection.",

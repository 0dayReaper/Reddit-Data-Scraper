Jabba put a bounty out on Han which made Han a lesson to other smugglers working for Jabba and it meant Han was always looking over his shoulder and wouldn\u2019t have a moments peace.\n\nBut Jabba didn\u2019t personally go after Han or send his own henchmen to find Han - that we know of.  Jabba more made Han\u2019s life hell and turned all of Han\u2019s friends and allies from the smuggling world into potential bounty hunters.  Luckily Han could trust the Rebels.  \n\nJabba\u2019s biggest mistake was being so stubborn about letting Han go after he was captured.",

Luke may be a bit better know simply because he told Jabba who he was, but also stated he's a Jedi so most bounty hunters would think twice before trying to take any revenge I'd imagine.

                                                            "comment": "It has nothing to do with TCW. The prequels actually had a cohesive story to them that you could understand while watching all three compared to the sequels.\n\nForce Awakens (the best of the 3) was just a picture for picture reboot of the originals except the seemingly helpless yet adventurous person who had former ties to the bad guys is a black dude instead of a white woman. The new big bad weapon is just an overzealous Death Star. And the only really intriguing thing they had going was Snoke. \n\nLast Jedi was just the worst movie to ever disgrace the movie theaters. I\u2019ve watched it dozens of times because I had no cable or Wifi for damn near a year, bought all the Star Wars movies I didn\u2019t have which *included* the sequels because I thought they\u2019d be like alcohol: the more you drink, the better it gets. Well, the more I watched, the more I realized I still hated it.\n\nYou wanna talk about stuff that ISN\u2019T worthwhile? Luke, the spectacle that EVERY Star Wars fan was chomping at the bit to finally see on the big screen for possibly the first time, just tosses his lightsaber over his shoulder like it\u2019s some piece of garbage and walking away, refusing to help. His whole issue with Ben (Kylo) was that he felt the tiniest bit of darkness in him and tried to kill him on the spot when he spent *years* of preparation and countless arguments with his father to turn him. When he was finally confronted with killing his father and joining Palps, he didn\u2019t and would have rather died. It doesn\u2019t make sense that he had *so* much patience with Anakin but then at the drop of a dime tries to kill Ben who was defenseless. Not only does that explanation not make any sense, nor does Luke acting the way he did, we have the random attempt of pairing Finn and Rose that didn\u2019t end well at all to the point Rose barely had a full minute of screen time in Rise of Skywalker. \n\nBut then we have Rey leaving, getting into the main ship with Snoke and Kylo, who has been keeping them in touch through the Force the whole time, and somehow he didn\u2019t know that Kylo was actually turning the lightsaber towards him before igniting it, killing the ONLY interesting character in this new trilogy. They fight the guards, then have a little scuffle themselves before\u2026 Tearing a lightsaber in half and the crystal explodes\u2026? The whole point of chick with the purple hair fighting against Po for no damned reason just to agree with him while NUMEROUS ships and people died? What the hell story is that!? Not to mention Leia, with no context within the movies, suddenly has god-like force powers that saved her from the oxygenless void like a space witch version of Mary Poppins. Then we get to the new Hoth. But, wait! It\u2019s not like Empire because it\u2019s not snow! It\u2019s\u2026 Salt\u2026 Right\u2026 Then Luke, after damn near getting his arms ripped off by Chewy, decides to send a force projection to save them and distract the First Order just for a crystallized fox to lead them down a certain path to have Rey, in the knick of time, open the path and save the day. Very lazy writing.\n\nAnd Rise of Skywalker\u2026 I was able to watch this outside of theaters on a website because I didn\u2019t want to waste my money at the time of it releasing, and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. A two hour movie took me four hours to watch it because I had to pause it and step away after some stupid bs that came up on the screen. What the hell is hyperspace skipping? The whole point of a hyperdrive is that you use it once and then it has to recharge after the travel. You then get Hux suddenly turning on the First Order by being the spy because he has some grudge on Kylo, and then immediately gets merced after we found out, so any bit of interesting storytelling that could\u2019ve come from that is gone. And all we got for his reasoning is, \u201cI hate him.\u201d \n\nThen we get Rey using force lightning\u2026 And for God\u2019s sakes, her using that out of nowhere??? Seriously? The whole point of Sith lightning is that they have to be hit with it before being able to use it. It\u2019s a transferable ability. \u201cWell Vader got hit with it and he couldn\u2019t use it.\u201d Yeah, because his limbs got cut off. Same thing with Dooku in ROTS. His hands got cut off so he couldn\u2019t use the lightning. Hell, Maul didn\u2019t have that ability because Sidious didn\u2019t plan on using it on him before he \u201cdied.\u201d \n\nBut the whole reason this movie exists is this: \u201cSomehow, Palpatine returned.\u201d This is a horrible attempt at fixing the mistake that Rian Johnson made by killing off the only interesting  character that happened to be the big bad. Then the whole MacGuffin with the pathfinders to find Exogul. The random finding of the deserted First Order troopers on Endor, the random showing up of Darkside Rey for, again, no reason. Rey stabbing Kylo then IMMEDIATELY healing him and he survived? Then the fight with Rey and Ben against Palpatine, winning, just for a fake death, transferring his life to her and then she wins against her all powerful grandfather\u2019s clone. This entire movie is nothing but a pretty light show in the form of CGI with no real story. And DONT GET NE STARTED on \u201cRey Skywa-\u201c \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e Nah. She ain\u2019t a Skywalker. Not how that works. Instead of trying to bring her in to the Skywalker family, she could\u2019ve used her fame to change the meaning of the last name \u201cPalpatine.\u201d You know? Like real life people have? Woody Harrelson is a prime example. Dad was a professional hitman, and Woody changed everything and gave his last name a good meaning that wasn\u2019t tied to his father. \n\nLast one: \u201cFans\u201d like you that say \u201cif you enjoy x you hate everything about Star Wars that\u2019s worth while,\u201d are the reason the community is so toxic. I don\u2019t enjoy the prequels but don\u2019t shit on the people that do enjoy them. I envy them because SW has been in my life for 16 years and I was more than stoked to see a new Star Wars movie in theaters, just for it to shit the bed. Have a great day.",

I don\u2019t remember a lot of the details but there was a whole thing. \n\nNew canon hasn\u2019t delved into a ton of detail but what we know is that Jabba had amassed a crazy amount of power and limited the influence of the other major Hutt Clans. A power vacuum is created when he dies which the other clans start fighting each other to fill. In the wake of this, Hutt client species (Nikto, Weequay, Gamorrean, Klatooinian, etc) started to rebel and grew their own syndicates. By the time of the sequels, the Nikto are much more influential than they\u2019ve ever been, and the Hutts are severely diminished. \n\nThat\u2019s basically all the detail I\u2019ve seen. In BOBF, they show us how the Twins are basically all threat, and give up trying to take control from Boba pretty easily once he foils their assassination attempt. I speculate that this is because they don\u2019t have anywhere close to the resources they would need to actually wrench control of the spice trade away from the Pykes, let alone be able to fight them in an underworld war. That said, I haven\u2019t seen any canon maps that detail Hutt space or any jurisdictional changes therein.",

I\u2019m sure some people close to him may have sent out bounties. But reality is they most likely cared more about getting a piece of his power.",

Regardless the Hutt families are in general greedy and opportunistic (that kind of defines their culture). Jabba's death would be seen as an opportunity to seize power for most of them, not a reason to seek revenge.",

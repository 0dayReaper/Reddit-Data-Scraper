            "comment": "I know he\u2019s one of the most portrayed villains, but I would love to see a movie or animated run of Maul: Lockdown. Definitely of my favorite Star Wars novels. \n\nBasically Maul gets tasked from Palpatine to get himself arrested and placed on a prison planet that\u2019s like a Roman Colosseum with the goal of finding information about a prisoner there. He\u2019s not allowed to get caught using the force or they\u2019d put him in a Supermax cell so he has to brawl his way through. \n\nSuch a good read that I think would make for a great movie or two part episode",

    "postText": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had a lot of issues. One of the criticisms of the movie was that it didn't take enough risks with its story. Here is my take on how to make the movie more interesting by changing the plot in a way that creates more emotional depth for the characters.\n\nIn the movie, Rey tries to save chewbacca by using the force when he is captured in a ship, and in the most surprising moment of the movie, she accidentally unleashes force lightning, destroying the ship. This is a powerful moment, because she thinks she has killed Chewbacca. The audience is shocked, and Rey is horrified by her actions and terrified by her own power.  The power of this scene is wasted when it is quickly revealed later that Chewy was on a different transport ship than the one she destroyed. This effectively cheapens the scene and its importance. \n\nThe plot and trajectory of the movie could be significantly improved by this one change: Chewbacca should have been on the transport that was destroyed by Rey- she would have been responsible for his death, and the weight of her actions would begin eating her up inside, causing her to question everything.   \n\nThis would send Rey into a spiral of fear and anger. She would feel guilty for what she has done and be consumed by the fear of her own power. She would begin to believe that the only way to control her power and prevent any further harm is to embrace the dark side. This is the only way to save her friends. This would create an interesting dynamic between her and Kylo Ren, who is already on a journey to the light. It creates a reason for Rey to draw nearer to Kylo for guidance, making their connection make more sense to the viewer.\n\nAs the movie progresses, Rey would become more and more conflicted. She would desire the power that would come from the dark side, but at the same time, she would be afraid of what it would do to her. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren would continue to be drawn to the light, and his interactions with Rey would become more complex and nuanced, with them each moving in the opposite direction.\n\nWith this internal conflict now making so much more sense than it did in the actual film, the visions of dark Rey would fit much more into the narrative.\n\nThe climax of the movie would involve Rey at Exegol actually considering an embrace of the dark side to resolve the conflict by taking out Palpatine. Kylo Ren has felt her drift to the dark side, and will show up to draw them both to the light. When Rey arrives, she has already been influenced and  seduced by the dark side and by Palpatine, and she would see Kylo/Ben as an obstacle, though now to her surprise on the other side. They would dual with lightsabers, with Rey propelled by her Fear and anger while Ben solo would finally be at peace about his path. Palpatine is pleased with their conflcit, and joins Rey in her attack.\n\nAs her friends are dying in the sky, and as Palpatine attacks Ben Solo, she realizes ,at a crucial moment, that she does not have to be a Palpatine, Rey would remember the words of Luke, leia, etc, and like Vader in the original trilogy would snap out of it, becoming the Skywalker she truly wants to be, and  she remembers why they were fighting all along. Perhaps we Even get some Anakin force voice here, alongside all the Jedi\n\nShe would reject the dark side and join forces with Ben Solo to fight against Palpatine. They are a diad in the force, and they need each other.\n\nThis change to the plot would create a more emotionally complex movie. Rey's journey would be more interesting and compelling, as she struggles with the consequences of her power. The weight of the death if Chewy would make for a stronger story. Kylo Ren's journey would also be more nuanced, as he tries to resist the pull of the dark side while also grappling with his feelings for Rey. She will pull him to the light while she is tempted by the dark.\n\nLet me know what you think!!!\n\nOther hot takes to come another day:\n1. C3po's sacrifice of his memory was made totally unimportant when R2D2 was simply able to reboot his memory.  This is unrealistic and diminishes the sacrifice. Too simple. He should have stayed wiped. He would still be the same character, and the personality would remain. It was another moment that took me out of the film and made me think \"Wow. Lame. No risk.\"\n2. The sith blade that led to the death star ruins was dumb. Do better. Use a map or a ship that has a log to the location, or a droid... A knife with an outline of ruins of the death star? Doesnt make sense, huge waste of a chance to show a cool star wars like technology.\n3. General Hux should have had a way stronger standoff with Kylo Ren before he was killed. Freeing the prisoners and getting shot was lame and wasted potential. If he were truly a solid leader, a confrontation is warranted. His death was lake, character wasted, and their imprisonment was an absolute joke.\n4.  The scene at the beginning of TLJ with Poe stalling was lame. The insult to Hux' mother took me out of the film entirely and did not fit for most star wars fans.... your mom jokes/insults have no place in star wars. Cheap writing. Also, in battles that type stall tactic would never work. Just not believable. Only die hard star wars fans that accept everything will defend this one and justify it. I've seen other posts that refer to puns and humor being ok elsewhere in the franchise, but to that I say jar jar was clearly designed to be goofy, but it fit his character and personality, and he was not a battle trained general dealing with the main villian. As for the c3po puns, his character is designed around awkward robotic quips and literal phrases, and he is a droid. I do not expect him to interact like a human.",

But I think the backlash would've been much worse if they'd actually gone through with killing him.\n\nI'm not convinced that killing Chewy would've done nearly as much as you say.  I think Rey's arc mostly makes sense as-is and killing Chewy would've only added a *smidge* of extra weight to it.  But even if I'm wrong, it wouldn't be worth it.\n\nThis is a situation where the medicine is worse than the disease it supposedly cures.",

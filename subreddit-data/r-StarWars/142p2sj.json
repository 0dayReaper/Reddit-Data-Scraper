Kanan had beaten the Grand Inquisitor by early season 2 (and it also depends on where in S2 you are taking it from for him, as he's easily bested by two Inquisitors in episode 10, but is able to take down Maul while blind in the finale of the season). Cal and Luke are still finding things out at that point in their development, but by the finale of Rebels, Ezra is a Jedi Knight with a lot of experience.",

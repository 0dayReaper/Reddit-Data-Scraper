Barriss Offee was a Force healer and even Obi-Wan and Ki-Adi Mundi could use Force healing. Anakin, however, could not use Force healing as it is a highly specialized discipline that can only be accomplished by Jedi Masters and specially trained Jedi healers. \n\nEven if Anakin knew Force healing and used that on Padme to save her from dying, he would have to be with her all the time and what Palpatine tells him is that there is a dark side ability that makes one, even a non-force user, immune to death. \n\nThe reason why Rey is able to Force heal Kylo Ren is because she studied ancient Jedi texts and she was a dyad in the Force.",

The whole crux of Anakin\u2019s arc within RotS is that he had an *ambiguous* vision of Padme dying in childbirth. He swore after his mother died that he wouldn\u2019t let that happen again. And building on the previous grooming from Palpatine he offers Anakin a way to do so at a crucial moment in his journey. \n\nConsidering Rey flexes her hand like it\u2019s stiff after healing the sand snake and Kylo straight up dies after healing Rey, it can be assumed that healing isn\u2019t just magically healing someone, but transferring the living force essence, meaning Anakin would have died to save Padme. (Not a concept I think Anakin would be against, but I think he\u2019d look for another option of someone, say Palpatine presented it). \n\nAlso all the talk of the force healing is a moot point because the vision he had was a self fulfilling prophecy, she died because his search for the power to save her is what ultimately killed her.",

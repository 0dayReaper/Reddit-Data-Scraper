    "postText": "I know it sounds weird but hear me out. Plagueis\u2019 life\u2019s work was all about using the force to bring a dead/near dead being back to life and to extend his own life. While we see in James Luceno\u2019s \u201cDarth Plagueis\u201d that he gets really close and I think could have been successful in the long run. Then we have Maul, a lowly (albeit skilled) Sith assassin. Neither Plagueis nor Sidious held him in very high esteem nor did they ever consider him much more than a tool. Yet when he faced his greatest defeat, on INSTINCT he used his rage to manipulate the force to keep himself alive from what should very clearly have been fatal injuries. I personally think that if Plagueis were still alive at the time of Maul\u2019s return, he would very much have wanted to study him in order to get the final pieces of his research and perhaps even learn how to save himself. Lmk what you think below.",

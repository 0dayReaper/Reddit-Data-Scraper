I really hope once they are done with Mass Effect and Dragon Age Bioware makes Old Republic 2 as singleplayer focused title. Coop would be nice though.\n\nPersonally i really love graphics style and world of Old Republic. Ideally sequel would be made more flexible so we don't have to continue eternal Empire vs Republic. KOTFE did not really work that well, but the idea was good. Best parts of SWTOR were ones that were made before release, but 8 story lines was way too much so they need to fix that. Maybe it would be best to have just 2 stories, one Jedi/Republic and one Sith/Imperial, and weaponry would be more flexible so everyone could have lightsaber and blaster weapon of some kind. That way they could be very flexible with stories, and same character could vary between Force based stories and non-Force based stories. \n\nVariety is important for long stories like what MMOs have, so they could start with for example what in SWTOR would have been Sith Warrior story, then wrap that one up. Then they could take command of Imperial Intelligence, and get stories from that!",

Especially because this art uses the logo Mando has on his own armour so that\u2019s just straight up copying and probs isn\u2019t transformative. But there\u2019s a big incentive from companies like Disney to just pay these artists anyway if they want to use this stuff in a film because it\u2019s cheaper than damaging your PR or filing a lawsuit. What\u2019s a few hundred/thousand dollars to a company that brings in billions of dollars a year.\n\nI suspect Disney wouldn\u2019t touch fan art though when it comes to lightsabers.

Disney denied his concept, but then went on to make a similar movie based on it, Pixar's *Coco* (2017), but with a white director instead.\n\n*The Book of Life* was originally optioned by DreamWorks in 2007, whereas Pixar started working on *Coco* in 2010.  Disney also tried to trademark the term \"Dia de los Muertos\" for *Coco* in 2013, when news broke about *The Book of Life* being made by animation studio Reel FX. This led to major Mexican backlash.\n\nDisney now owns all rights to *The Book of Life* with the Fox buyout as well. Gutierrez wanted to make a sequel to *The Book of Life* while the IP was still owned by Fox, but that's all up to Disney now, which makes it unlikely.",

My jaw dropped as the Orchestra played and Darth Vader\u2019s Devastator chased down Leia\u2019s Tantive IV.\n\nNow what was interesting was my grandfather\u2019s friend never sat with us.  He brought us food and drinks at least twice and stayed way back of the theater, by the exit/entry.\n\nYears later I understood why.  He was my grandfather\u2019s assigned body guard.  My Grandfather, a fellow classmate of FBI Director J Edgar Hoover, was the Deputy Director of the NBI, the Philippine equivalent of the FBI and the ISB.   So as you can see,  Star Wars and spy agencies started way early for me.",

I also imagine he won\u2019t be getting a lightsaber for a while, at least until he is older. \n\nEdit: yes I know his name is Grogu, I left it out of the title to avoid spoilers. And yes, I wrote the title while I was half asleep so i acknowledge it it is not grammatically correct lol. \n\nEdit 2: To those that are sharing this on Twitter or Instagram, thank you for enjoying my work that much, but make sure to credit me!",

Additionally, you fight for those you care for; protecting those you love from darkness, tyranny, and crime. \n\nNew official canon has Luke repeating the same mistakes about emotion and leaving people cut off from their old lives entirely, and even seeks out young people rather than accepting anyone, or so it seems given how any and all shown members of his order were at best teenagers.\n\nSo yeah.",

Fans then came up with a post-hoc explanation to try and make sense of it, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s ever been stated in-universe to be why they look similar. \n\nI\u2019d say that what we see with Luke\u2019s saber is more the exception than the rule. There are plenty of examples where apprentices don\u2019t homage their masters:\n* ~~Dooku\u2019s saber looks nothing like Yoda\u2019s.~~\n* ~~Qui-Gon\u2019s saber looks nothing like Dooku\u2019s.~~\n* Obi-Wan\u2019s RotS/ANH design looks nothing like Qui-Gon\u2019s.\n* Neither of Anakin\u2019s sabers look anything like Obi-Wan\u2019s.\n* Neither of Ahsoka\u2019s saber sets look like either of Anakin\u2019s (her first pair have elements of Obi-Wan\u2019s first saber).\n* Ezra\u2019s second saber doesn\u2019t look much like Kanan\u2019s (in fact, it has more elements of Kenobi).\n* Kyle Katarn\u2019s saber in Jedi Outcast looks nothing like Qu-Rahn\u2019s from Dark Forces II.\n* Ben Solo\u2019s saber looks nothing like Luke\u2019s or Anakin\u2019s.\n* Rey\u2019s looks nothing like Luke\u2019s, Anakin\u2019s, or even Leia\u2019s sabers.\n\nEdit: Removed Dooku\u2019s and Qui-Gon\u2019s from consideration since we don\u2019t know what their first sabers looked like.",

It's a more cutting and slicing vs hacking and slashing. The curve would be helpful with that.\n\nHim continuing to use his noble title, Count, and the ornate robes of his nobility vs the jedi standard robes helped demonstrate his separation from the jedi. I think this is mostly where Yoda was annoyed. I suspect Yoda would find the use of a weird light Saber and uncommon style as just a uniqueness, sort of how maces fighting style was so aggressive.\n\nJust my thoughts.",

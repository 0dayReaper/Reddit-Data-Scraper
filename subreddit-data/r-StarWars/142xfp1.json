    "postText": "My husband is looking for a specific artist whose Star Wars fan art he has seen on Twitter a few times in the last 5 years, but now can\u2019t find. The artist\u2019s illustrations look like the flat cardboard backing to an action figure with the plastic bubble and the figure illustrated as if inside that plastic bubble. These are not photos, but digital art. My husband recalls the action figured being original trilogy characters. He cannot recall the name or any socials for the artist. If this sounds familiar to you, please point us in the right direction! You\u2019re my only hope.",

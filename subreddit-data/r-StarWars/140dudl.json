The warmth is luxuriated in and drawn upon before the mind is cognizant of doing so. Next comes the illusion of linear time. Only then does a sense of individuality arise, a remembrance of what was and what is, a knowledge of one\u2019s self as separate from the Force. It provides a vantage point for experiencing the physical world in its complexity and ecstasy, but the pain of that separation is endurable only because unity will come again, and soon.\n\n&gt;That fracture from the all, that memory of temporal existence, is most easily summed up with the word the fracture was once called by. The name.\n\n&gt;\u201cQui-Gon.\u201d\n\n&gt;The name is spoken by another. Qui-Gon has been summoned. He draws upon his memories of himself and takes shape, reassem\u00adbling the form he last had in life.

This is from the Canon short story *Master and Apprentice* where Qui-Gon appears to Obi-Wan.\n\n\"Awareness precedes consciousness. The warmth is luxuriated in and drawn upon before the mind is cognizant of doing so. Next comes the illusion of linear time. Only then does a sense of individuality arise, a remembrance of what was and what is, a knowledge of one\u2019s self as separate from the Force. It provides a vantage point for experiencing the physical world in its complexity and ecstasy, but the pain of that separation is endurable only because unity will come again, and soon.\n\nThat fracture from the all, that memory of temporal existence, is most easily summed up with the word the fracture was once called by. The name.\n\n\u201cQui-Gon.\u201d\n\nThe name is spoken by another. Qui-Gon has been summoned. He draws upon his memories of himself and takes shape, reassem\u00adbling the form he last had in life. It seems to him that he feels flesh wrap around bones, hair and skin over flesh, robes over skin\u2014and then, as naturally to him as though he had done so yesterday, he pulls down the hood of his Jedi cloak and looks upon his Padawan.\n\n\u201cObi-Wan.\u201d It is worth the travail of individual existence just to say that name again. So he says the other name, too. \u201cBen.\u201d\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s hair has turned white. Lines have etched their traces along his forehead, around his blue eyes. He wears Jedi robes so worn and ragged as to be indistinguishable from the garb of the impoverished hermit he pretends to be. Most would walk past this man without a second glance. Yet while Qui-Gon perceives the phys\u00adical realities of Obi-Wan\u2019s appearance, he is not limited to human sight any longer. He also sees the confident general of the Clone Wars, the strong young Padawan who followed his master into battle, even the rebellious little boy at the Temple that no Master was in any hurry to train. They are all equally part of Obi-Wan, each stage of his exis\u00adtence vivid in this moment.\"",

The philosophy Yoda forced on everyone else for generations when he became grandmaster was non-attachment. So many fans misunderstand this.\n\nA Jedi is not necessarily discouraged from having a quick fuck, as long as it\u2019s kept quiet about by both parties involved. The only thing the Jedi discourage in that regard was the Jedi in question getting into long-term relationships. If two Jedi get into a one-night stand and never speak of it again, the Jedi usually don\u2019t care. It only becomes a problem for them when it becomes a full-on relationship a la an Anakin and Padme situation.\n\nThere were special exceptions in the Expanded Universe continuity. For example, Ki-Adi Mundi was allowed to have a whole family with four different wives at once. The reason for this was because Mundi came from a species (the Cereans) that had very low birth rates for males.",

What about him also being on Dagobah earlier? How does hyperspace travel work for a force ghost? are they sort of everywhere and nowhere all at once or is it like teleportation and they can just instantly be anywhere in the galaxy they want instantly? If they are able to maintain some of their essence to where they are visible, audible, and have their old physical form in the world of the living, are there any constraints on them in terms of movement, interaction, etc?\" And then you wonder how much of Luke's life was Obi Wan following him around for but invisible? Was he \"there\" for everything? Did he see Leia kiss Luke on Hoth? Was he disgusted? So many questions.",

In the first Thrawn book, I believe Obi-Wan basically says to Luke \"I can't stick around much longer\" and as far as I've read, he never elaborates what or who is making him return to the netherworld of the Force. It should remain that way.",

They even deepened this problem, when they showed force-ghost Yoda affecting the real world.  \n\n\nIt would be easier if they were just force \"memories\" or visions and only that one person could see them. Like that movie trope where main character get's advice in their dream from a deceased close friend or relative.",

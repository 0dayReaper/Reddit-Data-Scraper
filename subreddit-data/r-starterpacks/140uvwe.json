            "comment": "Irresponsible as hell in hindsight, but my neighbors\u2019 kid\u2019s bday party gave us Betta fish as goodie bags. They just had a whole ass table with little glass bowls and fish in them.\n\nFrom what I recall, I was pretty much the only one from that party to actually take care of the thing the best way a 10-year old from a pet-unfriendly household could; buying him a \u201cbetter\u201d fish bowl and cleaning it myself, feeding him betta food, buying kiddie books about betta fish. He lived a relatively good life for at least a year or so until we went on family vacation over winter break in February and came home to find out the heat had cut off while we were gone and he froze to death. I\u2019ll never forget finding that little red guy lying on his side with frost on his now black body. Freakin\u2019 world-ending.\n\nBut it did inspire a fish-keeping phase in middle and high school where I got actual aquariums and fish that weren\u2019t party favors.\n\nRIP though Norbby",

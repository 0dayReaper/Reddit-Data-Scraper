What I typically do. \n\nFlake salt and sit out steak for about 30 mins before cooking. \n\nPat dry. \n\nLightly apply fine salt. \n\nOven for 15-30 mins at 275f depending on thickness and preferred temp. When about 5-10 degrees less than what you want it, pull it out and let rest 5-10 minutes. \n\nHave a searing hot cast iron skillet, add grape seed oil and let it heat up. While doing this, cut a few pallets of butter and break up some thyme. \n\nSear the steak, (fatty side first if it has it, before the top and bottom). 1-2 minutes each side or until desired level of brownness. \n\nI typically use an outdoor grill with my cast iron so I leave 2/3 at high and the other side on low/med. Move the skillet to the off side, push the steak up and place thyme on top of it. Add the butter to the other side and lean the pan back so the butter is touching the hot portion, but not the steak. \n\nUse a spoon and baste the steak with the butter for a bit. Make sure to hit the thyme as well. \n\nTake off. Use fresh large coarse ground pepper on top. \n\nI typically also leave the butter in the pan, scrape the browning fond up, and add red wine. Reduce for a nice sauce (I typically like it on my potatoes). \n\nTime to eat!",

It's way easier than trying to make 15 steaks all to the exact right amount of done for each individual person. If it's a good cut of meat and you cook it correctly well done doesn't have to be disgusting. Well done and shoe leather are different things and it all depends on skill.",

Basically the more surface area that has touched cutting edges, the more likely it's been contaminated. So your grocery store ground beef that was processed quickly and cheaply is a bad idea to eat raw, but the restaurant that grinds meat in-house for the purpose of raw consumption will likely be taking extra steps to ensure safety",

So when you sear that strip the surface bacteria are beyond dead due to contact with the very hot cooking surface. This is why a rare or medium rare steak is safe, even if there were bacteria on the surface layer they still get the heat needed regardless.\n\nGrinding that same strip and cooking it to the same internal temperature is not equivalently safe because any bacteria that may have been present on the outside of the strip and now distributed throughout the entire thing. Now all that said if you bought your meat from a trustworthy source and ground it yourself the risks are extremely minimal and I'm personally fine with taking it for myself. Though I would urge caution in serving it to any children or elderly (or otherwise immunocompromised person) as it can easily become a lethal risk in those cases and there just is no reason to risk having someone's death on your hands to serve a better burger right.",

I buy it from a place that sells \"world food\" ingredients, they call it Chinese salt. You can get it off amazon too. And they always ask me what my secret is too. \n  \nMSG is amazing. If you don't wanna buy a bag of it, then use tomatoes, cheese, fish, meat, veg etc because those all have MSG in them. But I particularly like using Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. Those are big delicious MSG bombs and make everything taste better.",

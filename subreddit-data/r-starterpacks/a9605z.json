My theory is that the scrolling scenery reminded me of a videogame (2d platformers were huge when i was a kid). \n\nEdit: so many answers! It's super cool to read what everyone's character of choice was. Also apparently this predates videogames so it's probably something way more ingrained in human imagination :D",

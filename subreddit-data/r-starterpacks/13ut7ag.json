If a cat is raised indoors since birth, with proper mental stimulation, and companionship, especially if they have a catio, I don't see what is so stupid about protecting local wildlife that helps the ecosystem and keeping the cat safe from larger predators, cars, etc.\n\nI get why people want to let their cats outdoors though.

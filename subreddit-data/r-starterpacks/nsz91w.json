Now I'm self conscious because I'm overweight \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI've gone down to 215 over the last month or so, hoping to hit 180-190 by the end of the year.",

WV is very much a Purple State (when it comes to the senate) but coal mines have a big sway making the state Red. The general public sees Democrats as a party taking their livelihood away, along with bringing radical and uncomfortable social ideas of people of color being more and more a part of society. To some white folk seem like a \"takeover\" from what they're used to of white being the majority and norm. The solutions like transitioning and educating workers to working with green energy like wind isn't advertised. Sensationalism and strong emotions is what sells news and gets views, not solutions.\n\nThe fact the state is already poor with coal mining being a viable source of income for the state, they have poor education. This leads to uneducated folks who easily fall for Republican propaganda and conspiracy theories without a second thought since it usually appeal to tribal emotions. Trump 2020 Flags and Confederate flags are usually flown to show support for the Tribalism/Nationalism/\"Conservatism\" the Republican party has to offer.",

I was taking the bus to school and the kid in front of me was talking about how the confederates were gonna take back america and liberate west Virginia. I tried to explain the whole confederates supported slavery and shit but gave up once he said there were more white slaves than black slaves. \n\nNot to mention there's a huge nicotine abuse crisis with teens here. A whole fucking carton of cigarettes average at $5.77 here. It's to the point where most doctors hand out anti smoking papers during check ups basically begging we don't smoke. \n\nAnd finally to add on the cherry on top of the to the shitstorm of the hillbilly dumpster fire of west Virginia, there's confederate flags, blue lives matter flags, and trump flags fucking everywhere. I can see one from my window right now. EVERYONE is a qanon conspiracy nut except a quiet few. I openly talked about being gay in some of my classes and teachers had to pull me out to talk to me asking if Im ok with saying it since they think I'll get bullied or jumped just for being fucking gay. And that's why I don't want to transition here. This place is just a conservative wet dream. Fuck this place.\n\nEdit: did I mention one of the coffee shops near me has a sign along the lines of \"we know covid is a hoax but the state requires us to mandate mask wearing.\" \n\nThough I will admit, [it is a pretty state once you look past everything ](http://imgur.com/gallery/JH9NSZq)",

In those states a lot of people are overweight, you will see confederate flags on cars, you will see people open carrying in an Arby's, and you will meet a lot of genuinely racist people. Obviously this doesn't apply to the whole country, but these things do exist depending on where you go.",

I'm assuming she says the titular lines when her husband arrives.\n\nThe \"*your\" picture is telling a different, self contained story (or the sequel, dun, dun, dun). If the \"you're\" is swapped with \"your\", someone is saying to you: \"Oh my god, your home!\" As in, \"oh my god, your home is on fire!\".\n\nI, personally, want to view it as a sequel. Soldier comes home, wife says \"oh my god, you're home!\" when caught having an affair. Soldier ties the two up, sets up a mechanism for a fire to start, goes for a walk with the dog, gets some ice cream, comes back to see the house ablaze, and the neighbor yells \"Oh my god, your home!\"\n\n...but that's just me.\n",

When it comes to mission trips Mom and Dad may toss in a few bucks but the majority of.the funds come from them harassing their fellow church goers for money by using bullshit buzz phrases like, \"the Lord has led me to this place\" and they are sure to say that while they appreciate the monetary donations what they need the most is for you to pray for them. But they dont want that really, it's just an obligation to tack that on to the end of your pitch. They want the donation",

Most of the time they are nice to you because you are new and different and interesting and perhaps most importantly, you are among those who rule this planet. \n\nhey you say this but I just spent 16 years of my life in Tanzania, they are super chill and like everyone even in the biggest city will just talk to random strangers including myself and just be friendly. But someone will 100% try to steal from you  but if you catch them they just smile and give whatever they tried to steal back so there's that.  But yeah your point still stands no matter where you are from people from 3rd world countries aren't more moral than the rest of us assholes but at least where I lived they were more chill",

I helped out within my county, and went on a trip to another region within the USA.  I think the net cost per volunteer to travel and be fed was about 1200 bucks, late 2000s.  Travelled by van.\n\nI learned that some people are poor as shit in the US.  Both where I grew up, and in other parts/everywhere.  The trip was not glamorous.  There really wasn't anything exciting other than drug addled Americans trying to find Jesus.  I think we helped, but only as much as \"give a man a fish, and feed him for a day\". Fixed a roof here, a wall there, cooked a meal there. Probably a waste of money really.  \n\nCome back to school, and see the wealthy kids share their adventures, and it made me a bit sick.  The ones with the big pockets that travelled far, it felt like a self benefiting trip.  Also very little done to help, and a much larger waste of money.\n\nOne does not need to travel to help their neighbors.  \n\n",

Sometimes he\u2019ll even drink a craft beer. Has a faux-hawk haircut and a soul patch. And a NOTW decal on his Suburban.\n\n\n\nHe is really friendly with underage teenage girls; and constantly connects with them on social media. Especially that one goth chick with daddy issues  at every youth group who doesn\u2019t want to be there\n\nHe Says things like \u201c\u201dJesus was a savage bro\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not a religion, it\u2019s a relationship\u201d\n\nHe constantly talks about his wife and how they have a baby boy on the way, and his wife makes sure no one forgets her #ModestIsHottest Instagram spam and holds a Captivating devotional that encourages women to be lovely doormats.\n\nAnd finally, Finger guns when entering the room.

I think I got the better end of the deal. \n\nHe's a lost-cause now and acts more like an asshole teenager in his 30s than when he was an actual teenager. Teenage him was a decent dude but then he watched foxnews for two decades and got radicalized by the tea party, so now he's a caricature of the worst kind of evangelical.",

There are even special 'baby rescue' programs ehere the babies being 'rescued' could have EASILY been 'saved' from ever needing rescue with very inexpensive care. https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/13/the-business-of-voluntourism-do-western-do-gooders-actually-do-harm As long as foreigners are paying thousands to \"rescue babies\" there is a perverse incentive to put children in harm's way both by neglecting their affordable health interventions and by institutionalizing them. Voluntourism is nasty business and everyone who signs up should know ehat they're feeding.",

Their stated purpose was to help some startup church with manual labor.  The sycophantic clown of a youth pastor showed up in service the Sunday after in his flip-flops and showed the photo slideshow - it was maybe 50% pictures of the group mucking around in a half built structure, and the rest was pictures of the group in their swimsuits on a gulf coast beach.  \n\nI don't know if he officially got any kind of reprimand for orchestrating what amounted to a free vacation for himself and a dozen high school students, but I do know that my parents were furious and lost a lot of respect for the leadership of the church.

            "comment": "Here\u2019s some context for people that may be a little offended/confused. As a proud graduate from a Private Christian College, this is a large majority of the students on campus, particularly in the religion department.\n\nHowever, being an African American student at this school, it was always a little bothersome to me that students would go above and beyond to go overseas to serve kids that looked just like us but weren\u2019t always friendly to student right on campus. Alongside that, I just personally believe American missionaries cause more harm than good overseas simply because the assistance is Super temporary and invasive more than actually helpful. Plus there\u2019s such a need locally, that I feel like we\u2019re doing our own community a disservice.\n\nThe reason I didn\u2019t add any of the super \u201caggressive\u201d  or \u201cdisturbing\u201d things about missions is because, while unfortunately common, not something I wanted to highlight. I\u2019m still a huge fan of doing missions work and have done a lot of it myself, but I just tend to stick to local missions instead.\n\nMissionaries are really commendable people and doing wonderful things when they\u2019re truly serving because they feel called to. It\u2019s the attention whores that make it a mockery.\n\nS/N: Nalgenes were on the school supply list at my school; I have 5 of them. And they\u2019re awesome!",

When I was in college I volunteered in an after school program with low income kids. Most of the time I was the only white person in the room and generally over the course of a semester there were only 2 or 3 other people from my university who volunteered with the same program even though there were over 30 kids and they could have used more volunteers.\n\nThe fact that some students were willing to fly to Africa with no discernible skills rather than spend a few hours a week on the other side of town was really strange to me. Some of the oversees trips had legitimate academic research value and some of them were by engineering students who would then design and build water systems and teach local villagers how to maintain them but some of the mission trips didn't have much utility beyond providing and experience for wealthy white suburbanites.",

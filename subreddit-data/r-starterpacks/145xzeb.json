Kindly add me as friend. Good night beautiful\"*\n\nYou look at the profile of this scammer, and it's always a photo of a handsome, middle aged man, who's location is \"New York, USA\". Occupation is a pediatric cardiac surgeon. hobbies are volunteering at children's hospitals or animal shelters. Yet, someone this successful, handsome, wealthy, and giving/kind....just has no luck in the romance department and has to troll random Facebook groups to find love. \n\nI can't believe that there are still people who fall for this horseshit.",

I read an account on r/scams once where someone was trying to convince their mom she was being conned by a romance scammer, but the mom flat out didn't care whether it was real, because she just loved having someone to talk to and make her feel special.\n\nI have no sympathy for people who get romance scammed while trying to cheat on their spouses though",

I've gave him a number for the gift card for his so called daughter, I sent his \"agent\" some money and he had the audacity to ask me for more money for his imaginary car, house and I've told him that I couldn't afford to give him that much money.  I thought I was going to meet a man in the US but  found out that it was a romance scammer from Nigeria. I used to get scammed on FB and I made a huge mistake of meeting someone there and when it comes to online dating scammers are going to look for an innocent man/woman to love bomb so they can be able to take their money.",

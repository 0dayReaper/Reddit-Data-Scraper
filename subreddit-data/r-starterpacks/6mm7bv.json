The sheer amount of commitment, time, money, skill, equipment, and logistical planning into getting incredible images is not appreciated. Our photographers have been mauled by animals, captured by tribes, and even lost their lives in war zones to get the images that astound you in our magazine. \nSo when these people on the sub talk about what it took to get the image don't take it as whining, take it as them telling part of the adventure that went into creating the image. For amateurs not making money off of it to go through such great lengths because of their passion and dedication to their hobby really is commendable. \nThis is why we created YourShot and have included amateur photographers in our media. Sometimes they put in the same effort our pros do. ",

                    "comment": "Seriously, as a (amateur) photographer it's incredibly frustrating. They turn the settings up to unbelievable levels, HDR things to death, let color fringing and moire stay, don't color grade, etc. It's so easy to do it decently. There's even a whole sub dedicated to editing your pics properly /r/postprocessing\n\nedit:clarity",

Several successful companies operate there, great school systems even in the rural parts, great place to raise a family because people are nice, great place to retire because winters aren't too hard, beautiful scenery, city is literally at a the base of a mountain which has a ski resort on top of it.  I've lived all other the country and Boise is by far the best place I've lived.  This is compared to Cali, upstate New York, Utah, Nevada, New England, and South Carolina.  Yea there's Mormons there, but not like Utah Mormons who claim to be religious or spiritual and flip you off for not driving 10 over the speed limit.  Boise drivers aren't in a life or death situation everywhere the go so they respect road laws and other drivers.  Boise has some of the best eating and bar establishments in the northwest outside of Seattle or Portland.  Working in Utah, my boss would take any chance to go have a meeting in Boise which is why he hired someone specifically in Boise and my boss is from Pittsburgh.  Boise pretty much has the perks of metropolis city minus the population. In what the Salt Lake Valley has, Boise has minus a few million people and the Jazz.  They have BSU but most college towns are like that.  Not to mention your 20 minutes away from any other outdoor activity.\n\nGoing to Boise is a good thing.  I've never said, gee i regret going to Boise.  It's always, I regret going to X i should have gone to Boise instead.\n\nThe potatoes are grown in Eastern Idaho.",

Everyone knew who they were and their kids, although mostly low key and never in your face about it could not avoid it because of their surnames.  \n\nStuff like that becomes unavoidable. If the kids don\u2019t talk and want to keep it hush, parents will once they hear a friend has X surname. Parental gossip at schools is just as obnoxious as teenage gossip, if not more so since adults should know better.",

When I went to college in a different state, I never mentioned anything about my home life, but must have mentioned my town name to my buddy in passing. He was from a different state so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nHe walks into the dorm one day, saying: \u201cI found out something about you today\u201d with a shit-eating grin. \n\nMind you, I\u2019m just coming to terms with my sexuality at this point so I\u2019ve got Tell-tale Heart syndrome and think I\u2019ve been outed somehow. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re rich\u201d, he goes. Relieved but annoyed, I ask what he means. Turns out he struck up a conversation with some random girl in his 300-student lecture hall and when she said where she was from, he told her he had a friend (me) from around there. Turns out she was from two towns over from where I grew up and told him I probably lived on a golf course in a big house. \n\nThen my inner circle of friends just kinda knew before forgetting because, as per the critters above, I never talked about it. From then on though, I just started saying I was from the less--bourgie town adjacent to mine.",

And it gets worse because they can\u2019t defend against it. They didn\u2019t choose to be rich. But they still get victimized by poorer people who feel like life is unfair and try to balance the scales. And it also doesn\u2019t help that people are less sympathetic towards rich people.\n\nSo the only thing they can do is to just avoid it all together. After all, showing off isn\u2019t necessary when people already know that you are wealthy. Plus, they save the showing off to people who matter to them.",

These people have all migrated north to Ohio and there is a great book that I am blanking on the name that looks into this migration and how it has changed the areas. \n\nAlso both Nashville and my city in Kentucky had a huge influx of New Orleans resident move here after Katrina.

I'm here to tell you that that's part of the job. It's made extremely clear before they get hired that sometimes long hours are expected. Sure, you can refuse to do it, but you won't be an employee for long and you'll have a hard time finding an employer that would put up with that. However, in return I have a stable salary, the ability to occasionally work from home, flexible working hours, and a hell of a lot of other \"intangible\" benefits.",

They drove 10+ year old cars, 2nd hand clothes/furniture/appliances, Both parents graduated with no debt from school (scholarships + parents helping + working during school). We later found out it was cause parents were putting roughly 50% of their income into retirement savings and so they didn't spoil their kids. Unfortunately their parenting skills didn't work out for any of their kids, they still grew up drunks, druggies, and bad with money even after attending university.",

His mom turned the light on to see three of us leaning butt to butt to butt with one guy holding a lighter to our farts. \n\nAlso the time I used all of their sugar to make smoke bombs that I had to piss on because the grass caught on fire in their yard. \n\nIt was one stupid stunt after another but they put up with us and it honestly kept us out of real trouble.

United lounge is more crowded than the gate. Some first class lounges have pretty good made-to-order food you order off a menu and someone makes it for you. Typically only flagship airports have these though, lufthansa in frankfurt, swiss in zurich etc. Regular lounges might have anything in between stale soup and pretty good food. But its mostly not good and buffet style.",

If you\u2019re paying $10k for a ticket, they can hire a cook and bartender for you. Lufthansa has a first class terminal in frankfurt. But most airlines have cheaper first class, the product in the picture (guy in a narrow cabin) is the only real photo (at least i think, looks like Singapore Suites), rest are fake stock photos. First class lounges can be anything in between private dining space and a separate section of the regular lounge.\n\nMost airlines these days started treating the business lounge as frequent flyer lounge which make them pretty crowded. I\u2019ve only flown lufthansa first (with points obviously). It was good but can\u2019t imagine paying for it unless i was making 10x more than now.",

Actually knew exactly where the place was and gave me detailed directions. When I was heading back to my terminal post-coffee obtaining, I stopped back by and proudly showed it off to the desk guy and thanked him again.",

I loved every second of it lol, especially the ability to make the seat into just a flat bed. The food was also good.

These are generally narrow body (737/A320 single aisle) planes with 2-2 configuration. They\u2019ll be bigger seats and some better food but not much to write home about. Some flights like LAX to NYC will fly wide body (2 aisle) planes or specially configured narrow-body planes with lie flat seats (AA does this). \n\nInternational long haul is where it starts to get good. Business class on a lot of airlines is what first class used to be 15-20 years ago. Lie flat seats, gourmet meals, and good lounges. First class has become something kind of nuts on the nicer airlines that still have it, as a lot have realized they don\u2019t need it. Emirates, Singapore, Qatar, Qantas (hot take, but I like it), Cathay, JAL, and ANA are all very good, to name a few.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve only used points to get upgrades or award seats in long haul business.",

For the same flight a 'business class' ticket is ~4,000 USD and a true 1st class (as pictured above with shower and lie flat bed) is ~10,000 USD. \n\nGranted I generally travel to less expensive places (though coming from the Bay Area that is basically everywhere) but I would much rather have an extra 3k or 7k to spend on the trip than just be able to have a shower and unlimited drinks when flying. 3k extra is easily 1 or 2 more heavy expense activities and upgrading one level in hotel/Airbnb over a 2 week trip. Or, 3k is a whole other trip (though not including PTO). \n\nI guess the business class ticket makes sense if you are a very tall person (I am not) and sitting in economy for 12 hours is going to be unbearable or if cost is just not an issue at all.",

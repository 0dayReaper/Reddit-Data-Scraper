It sounds silly but there's a bus route in my city that I strongly associate with the worst periods of anxiety for me, just due to the fact that I rode it a lot during those periods. Being able to avoid it actually helped a lot.\n\nI know this is very anecdotal but I can't help but to urge people to get diagnosed if they think something is wrong. It can help more than you think.",

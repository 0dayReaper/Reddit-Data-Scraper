Trends have been coming in and out of fashion faster than before, so one aesthetic is hard to pin down.\n\nBut the 2010's are still so fresh in our minds, its hard to pin a general feeling for that era. When we get to 2025ish all the less meaningful trends will have been forgotten, and we'll have a more specific type of aesthetic for the 2010's.",

In 2002 we were still rocking baggy clothes, things were metallic for no reason, boy bands and girl groups were still huge, and futurism inspired everything. By 06, emo had spilled into the mainstream, tight shirts and skinny jeans were coming into play, and vintage aesthetics were beginning to override the bubbly, futuristic look of the earlier years of the new millennium. When we look back, it\u2019s pretty much just scene kids, purse dogs, inflatable furniture, Destiny\u2019s Child, and bootcut jeans all amalgamated into a blob called the early 2000s, even though a lot of those things existed separately from one another.",

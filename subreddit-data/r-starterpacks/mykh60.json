I'm well aware there are many songs that don't fit this formula. I'm more referring to most popular songs, like the kind you hear on the radio or top 50 charts.",

This was a fun song for me because I grew up hearing it on car trips with my mom and it's a good bouncy vibe that was easy for kid-me to remember. Of course the lyrics are dumb, the lyrics of half the songs on the radio don't make sense, but if you tell someone that their favorite song is stupid, it ruins the magic. :(",

I always get into things years later because people kept trying to force feed me these things.\n\nAlso adults have to cut it with the whole \u201cor music was way better than the garbage out today\u201d.

Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. But you can't possibly expect to have someone give a predetermined reaction to a song when you introduce to them. Whenever you have someone listen to a song or piece, you are introducing it in a communal setting which can affect how they consume it. Its interpersonal as a opposed to personal. So unconsciously, you're immediately expecting them to like the song based on what your personal history with it is in hopes that it their preferences will line up with your own unique interpretations of the song. Also in turn, they now have an expectation of the song being good because they have a certain level of trust from you as they (hopefully) appreciate your perception of them and their interests. Unintentionally and naturally (unless they are aware of this phenomenon) most people set their own expectations of what the music will sound like and base their enjoyment of the movement on that initial impression by you. It is extremely rare that the music will match exactly in that way. If the music that you are presenting to them represents a deep (or relatable) emotional connection with you, you gotta remember that they are not in that exact headspace. \n\n\nTL;DR: Like the music you like and don't worry. If it strikes someone's fancy, great! If not, just enjoy the moments and music you share together.",

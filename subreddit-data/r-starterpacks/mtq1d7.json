The OG movies don't have an amazing plot but it's absolutely fun and the writing is good enough to be watchable. What makes them so 'good' is the amazing practical effects. Seriously it's almost jaw dropping to this day especially when you see other movies from that time period. \n\nAs for the prequels and sequels? I can't say the same. I definitely love the prequels because I grew up watching them but I can see why an outsider to the franchise would be put off. I will say though that EP 1, 2 and 3 at least have more interesting openings and they're fun to watch. They quickly loose steam, though.",

I realize not everyone is like me though where I binged most significant films from 1960 -2012 in my teens/early 20s thanks to piracy though. Even still, that movie almost forces itself on you from any available outlet and you would almost have to actively avoid it not to have seen it if you were born between like 1970 and 2010.",

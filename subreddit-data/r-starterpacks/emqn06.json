I was going outdoors, getting lots of exercise, and maintaining friends through that peer group (which overlapped with my classmates in school pretty heavily).\n\nThen when I finished my webelo (sp?) stuff and it was time for me to become a full fledged boyscout I went to the ceremony but they never called my name. After I asked my parents what was up and they said they didn't want to keep up with the schedule it required and I wasn't allowed to stay in boyscouts.\n\nThen my dad became abusive when I started playing video games and staying inside because I had nothing else to do. He even threatened to throw out the xbox I bought with my own money because he didn't want me to have it. So I basically wasted the majority of my highschool experience being depressed, out of shape, and with no friends. It wasn't until I had my own car (that I walked to work at a minimum wage job after school to buy) that I was able to start reforging my life and becoming social.\n\nThe most fucked up part is my mom was a SAHM, she didn't even have work to miss. She just didn't want to drive me around and my dad didn't want to have to be that involved in my life.\n\nI didn't get my life together until I figured out how to parent myself and I'm still struggling having basically been raised by the internet and television.",

Go to the gym, follow a simple routine and don't run down a rabbit hole of having to do everything right. Just show up for an hour 4x a week.  (why does everyone mention this? exercise promotes physical health, and mental health by reducing cortisol - the stress hormone). \n\n2. Accept yourself and the present, live in the present and work on your current situation. \n3. Worry, fear, pressure are all negative emotions and feelings. Most importantly they will not help you in your quest forward. So do not pay attention to them. The only thing you can control is your present and the habits that will shape your future. \n4. Decide who the person you want to be is. For me that's someone who speaks at least 2 languages, is self-employed, and in shape. So for me those habits I include into my routine are language learning, working out, and working on my business daily.\n5. Control your time, here is my setup at my desk that I follow each day before work. I use dry-erase notecards and place a checkmark by each as I progress. \n6. Make small actionable steps towards your goals in addition to mental and physical health and your life will really transform, these small goals consistently add up and you'll be super surprised. \n\nAs a note, I used to plan every hour of my day but now I actually want to hit those checkmarks so I know I don't have to make sure I'm not screwing around as much. If I get off track, then I'll plan each hour of the day again.\n\nLastly, you can be happy right now today - choose to do it. Don't be outcome dependent on something miraculous happening or place your happiness on outside factors \"getting the girl\", \"getting the promotion\", or \"getting the six pack\". Nah outlooks like that take control away from you, just take small steps and be happy every day that you're following your plan.",

At 13 my two cousins, also the age of my sister and I, came to live with my mum after they left their parents to escape abuse. After this the neglect tripled and the abuse got worse. I spent every week alternating between a chaotic, anxiety inducing bureaucracy of a house at my mum\u2019s and a withdrawn, hateful and vengeful, grief stricken and depressive hole of a house at my Dad\u2019s. I was completely and utterly isolated and forgotten, was suicidal for 4 years, which I kept to myself - I never felt like there was anyone I could tell. \n\n\nMy Dad is still a lonely man today, and lives through me and through his self imposed grief. I have a much better relationship with my mum and step dad now that all us kids are at university and I am relatively free of my Dad\u2019s attempts to brainwash me against them. \n\n\nDespite this I\u2019m still haunted every day by the trauma induced by years of torment. I know more than most how it feels to lose all power over your own life, to lose all meaning, purpose and hope. I know how it feels to dissociate and feel like a little person stuck inside a body, watching the world from inside a dark cave. These scars stay with me and probably will forever.\n\n\nAnyway, the reason I said all this is that I wish my parents were more involved in creating a life for me that wasn\u2019t just keeping me alive while they barely managed to hold on themselves. There are so many aspects of childhood innocence and coming of age that I missed out on because I was too busy surviving. At least I know what kind of childhood I\u2019ll give my kids.",

As a kid it was like a gut punch when my \"friends\" started talking about \"what happened yesterday at ____'s house\" and I realized they were all seeing each other outside of school on a near-daily basis, while I spent every single evening alone at home, waiting for my mom to finish work. I was never allowed to have a real friendship, never learned how, and now I'm an awkward adult with ~~no~~ few friends.\n\nAnd in my adolescence, once it became clear that other people *did* have friends that talked to them and hang out outside of class, I imagined that everyone I talked to was hanging out together and deliberately excluding me. Hello anxiety. I was even proven right in high school by people who told me all the time that we were friends, but who had a secret group chat to plan events without me knowing. Once I overheard them talking about a party, asked if it was something they'd be okay with me going to, and they said \"yes, of course, you're our friend, we'll send you the details!\" The following monday, I saw pictures of the party go up on social media. When I asked about it at school, they denied that a party had ever been planned or taken place, despite the photos. That one never really stopped stinging.",

One day I was watching them talk, and I realized that this whole time they had never, ever tried to include me in the conversation. They were turned away from me, gossiping about people I didn't know, never once looking over to see if I was following or even remotely interested. So I just stood up and walked away without a word and never sat with them again... I don't even think they noticed, haha.\n\nThen a few months later, the friend found me during lunch and asked if we could hang out, and I was like oh shit okay!! Cause maybe she missed me and wanted to make amends and-- \"yeah [friend] is home sick today and we stopped being friends with [friend 2] so I'm by myself today haha... OH, not that that's the only reason I want to hang out with you, obviously.\" Yeah. Obviously...",

I am only now repairing my relationship with my dad and sister. I met a woman who I married 2 years after I got clean and she really helped me get back to who I was and my father is starting to see that. Her and I moved down south and I really only see my parents on Christmas when we travel up to stay at their place. \n\nMy sister flew in 2 Christmas\u2019 ago and we actually got along great. I reached out to her after I got clean and apologized, then apologized a couple more times after that. It felt like all fell on deaf ears. \n\nBut, slowly and surely it seems like they are seeing that I truly have changed. I just feel absolutely terrible for making those 8-10 years absolute hell for them. Whenever I apologize to my mom she just says \u201cdon\u2019t apologize, just stay clean\u201d. \n\nI will mom.",

I think as he got older and spent more time around our mom he started to understand what I went through, too, and that helped.\n\nTBH I think there are a lot of shitty parents out there who never should have had children because their shitty behavior had a massive ripple effect on an entire generation of kids. Which is part of why I don't want to have kids myself. I don't want to even risk potentially doing that to a child.",

                                    "comment": "Black and white, blanket punishments like this happen because state and federal governments have attempted to industrialize education. It should be to a degree individualized for each student. Certain ideas, methods and topics can be mass replicated but not everything. As well- young students aren't viewed as adults. If an adult was acting strange you wouldn't necessarily punish him or her- rather you'd ask what's wrong / why they're doing X or what's motivating them. Thus once you label ^(denigrate) a human being down to **\"a Child\" \"a Student\" \"a Trouble Maker\" \"a Class Clown\"** the need to treat them like an equal diminishes. For teachers providing individualized education isn't really an option nor is providing for a lack of emotional support. As well it's difficult for teachers to find ways to inspire their students when education *(at least at the high school level)* is largely standardized and success measured by test scores.\n\nAt best a teacher would get to know the student on an inter-personal level to establish why he or she is doing X behavior. Then the teacher would ensure the student knew why such behavior is unacceptable given the goals of the class/educational system. After the teacher would try to inspire the student to get on board with the class objective. (\"Learn Algebra!\") Unfortunately most teachers lack the time and energy to do this for half a dozen students. Moreover even if the teacher takes the time to get to do the above steps, it's not a guarantee the student will be ***inspired***  to memorize what a Vertex is, a Scalene triangle is or what a Convex polygon is.\n\nSuch is the crux of expecting every student to want to learn a curriculum some Ivy League graduate in Washington decided. Most people adult or child are looking for social and emotional acceptance. Allowing a young person to develop a positive self-identity via school sports, hobbies or academic pursuits is the best way to ensure a good future. You can't change the system, or really fight it at this point. But you can grant young people access to better tools for future. Those tools being social and emotional skills..\n\n***TL;DR:*** **There's not much teachers can do because to some degree the westernized educational system is designed to punish those who're out of line. Not to help them. Treating the students like peers- complex human beings is a step in the right direction. Consider them as people and try to understand and empathize with their struggles.**\n\n[We should consider the idea that youth is not actually wasted on the young. That their dramas are no more grand than they should be. That their emotions make perfect sense, once you adjust for inflation. For someone going through adolescence, life feels epic and tragic simply because it is: every kink in your day could easily warp the arc of your story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgyEmYyQF4)",

Emphasis on the important parts:\n\n&gt; Tipping your family mechanic for quality service is totally cool. **I wouldn't tip someone who worked at a large car repair joint, but a local mom-and-pop shop? Absolutely.** Often times, they'll turn down the tip and tell you to spend the money on gas anyway. Treat people well and you'll be treated well.\n\nSomeone getting paid \"an hourly wage\" or a salary working for someone else? No.\n\nSomeone who is running their own shop and likely did a number of things, such as...\n\n* Getting you in ahead of schedule?\n\n* Cutting you a deal on \"shop time\", which is how prices get inflated? (The other really annoying part is \"supplies\" -- where you get charged $20 when they're really talking about buying fucking towels.)\n\n* Not throwing a fit if you don't want to go through insurance?\n\n* Actually giving you the real fix as opposed to a temporary stopgap that'll keep you coming back?\n\nYou damn right I'll tip. That's someone who would deserve it.\n\nEdit: I can understand the confusion on the whole mechanic thing because there really is a big difference between someone working at Walmart Auto and someone running their own small business, so I should've been more specific.\n\nI don't mean to sound too \"parental\" here, but how could you not tip a kid who mows your lawn? That's a young person who is learning the value of hard work. It's better for the lawn kid to be mowing lawns than getting into trouble. And mowing the lawn is hard work. It's usually fucking hot out, and it likely isn't the only lawn they're mowing that day.\n\nI'd rather be a sucker and tip the lawn kid for those reasons than the alternative. The alternative is to come up with \"reasons\" to justify why it's okay to be a cheap fucking bastard so you have $220 instead of $210 in your pocket at the end of the day.",

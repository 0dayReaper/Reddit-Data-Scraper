Feel like he said that just to appease to the American audience (interview was with American media). He also used to say Naruto's design and inspiration was based on Super Saiyan Goku, which make sense looking at the outfit, hair and eyes colors etc.",

We were in hot, sweaty conditions, I had really thick hair that, as a result of the sweat, often stood up, and I was physically stronger than I looked. This combined meant, to them, that I was, \"Kakarot,\" which initially escaped me. A few weeks in I asked, because it wasn't a Spanish word like I'd thought and couldn't figure out, and that's how I learned they fucking love dbz, which I also liked, but just hadn't remembered Goku's real name.",

Plus some foreign relations as well, since many are shared by multiple countries.\n\nEDIT: Also remembered Hogwarts also teach Defence Against the Dark Arts, which for all effects, is a form of military training, so they even have a hand at Defence.

By her second semester, she was ordered to dye her hair black every four days but was banned from classes and even excluded from a school trip because teachers decided it still \u201cwasn\u2019t black enough,\u201d Hayashi says.\n\n&gt;When she refused to keep dyeing her hair, she was told not to bother coming to school. Later, her parents tried to negotiate a way for her to return, only to find her desk had been removed from the classroom and another pupil assigned her school ID number.\n\n&gt;[...] \n\n&gt;Nearly half of Tokyo\u2019s public high schools require students whose hair is not black and straight to submit certification to prove it\u2019s natural and not dyed or permed, according to a report by NHK, while the Mainichi newspaper found the proportion even higher in Osaka.\n\n&gt;Miyuki Nozu, a 32-year-old woman now working with refugees, went to a private school that demanded students with brown or curly hair carry certification with them at all times. Eyebrows were regularly checked to make sure students had not plucked them, while socks had to be white and folded three times.\n\n&gt;[...] \n\n&gt; In schools, it doesn\u2019t stop at hair color. In the city of Nagasaki, nearly 60 percent of 238 public schools demand that pupils wear white underwear, NHK reported, with one student telling the broadcaster teachers regularly check their underwear when they change for gym class.\n\n&gt;In Fukuoka, 57 out of 69 schools surveyed by the lawyers\u2019 association had rules about underwear color, the Asahi newspaper reported. Some schools even reportedly asked pupils to remove their underwear if they broke the rules.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt;A young Japanese woman has taken her Tokyo high school to court for abusing its power by asking her to \u201cvoluntarily withdraw\u201d after she broke the rules by dating a boy in her class. Even though she was just a few months from graduation, she felt obliged to drop out, Japan Today reported.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt;rules requiring children to take all their textbooks home can cause back problems; and rules banning winter clothing or scarves can also damage children\u2019s health.\n\nThese shows are rather divorced from reality if they're meant to be set there.",

Japanese people pretty uniformly have black hair and dark eyes, but Japanese anime characters usually have light colored eyes and default brown hair. Sometimes they're even blonde\n\nThis is more defaultism/projection on your part. Lots of anime characters have abnormally large eyes, and small or thin noses that do not exist in real life. They are more akin to \"grey\" aliens in many cases, than actual humans.\n\nPeople don't have all these wacky colours of hair of eyes or in real life. Nobody has naturally pink, blue, green, silver, etc. hair and more often than not they are stand-ins for actual colours where blue or green might mean black and red might indicate brown, or they are just to differentiate characters so you can instantly recognise who is who. Especially if the art style and character designs have a case of sameface.\n\nIt's more obvious that they're not meant to depict 'white' characters when characters from 'western' nations when you see Japanese media going back decades and they often depict blond Americans as having Pinochio or beak-like noses that are extremely long and stick out much farther, and beadier eyes\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sya0NWYhjM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HWuOUxU2dQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOmu05gPXRg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRhxfoo9Z-A\n\nAnd so on.

You usually rely on cultural features to tell them apart\n\nAlthough there are a few series out there that have an art style that does depict ethnicity well. I really like Attack on Titan\u2019s because of that, the nationalities have some slight differences that can be matched to real groups (I\u2019ve always been reminded of Germanic people by the Eldians, and Marley seemed Italian) (also Asians and Caucasian can be told apart)\n\nI want to give even further credit to Isayama here, so another thing he did very well is drawing families. The characters definitely look related and when placed side by side it feels like you can see the bloodline (although that might be my mind projecting what I already know about the characters)",

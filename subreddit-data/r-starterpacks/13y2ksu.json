There\u2019s a moment where he breaks down and laments that he\u2019s *just an anime protagonist*: someone with no personality, no redeeming traits, just a shut-in NEET who disappoints his parents. You have to give re:zero time; it\u2019s like Steins;Gate in that way.",

And since it's been a part of internet culture since the beginning, as internet culture started to meld with our culture in general as we all became more and more internet dependent, so to did anime meld into the general culture. Back when I was in middle school, saying you watched anime would get you shoved in a locker, but now that you have a generation of kids who's grown up with the internet thier  whole lives, and it seems like every middle schooler I see toady watches anime",

Anyways he went through a phase where he got super religious and wanted to give up sex until marriage and I went along with it. Also had another ex who liked anime, my friends complained he didn't shower enough but I didn't really have a sense of smell so I guess I didn't mind it.\n\nBut yeah nowadays even friends who are \"normal\" give anime a try. Maybe I won't find the hottest people ever with a huge anime count on myanimelist. But I think streaming has really helped make anime more accessible and it's easy to take it for granted.",

The problem is attention seeking behavior.\n\nWhen you do things that request my attention, such as unexpected Japanese cartoon stickers on your car, you will receive attention. If I feel like my time or attention is wasted on your attention seeking behavior, I'll be judging you negatively for it.\n\nIf you need to do \"unique shit\" to get people to recognize you, then you will come into contact with people not liking you wasting their time with it.",

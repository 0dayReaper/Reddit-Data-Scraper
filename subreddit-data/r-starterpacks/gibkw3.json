So while tornadoes do happen regularly there, it's more comparable to a place like Georgia than central Oklahoma - and Georgia doesn't really pop into anyone's brains as a tornado-heavy place either.  We just have larger swaths of land (Alaska, the west) where tornadoes are extremely rare that bring down the average. Still, interesting to know",

One story was of a repeated sighting of the ghost of a gentleman wearing old fashioned clothes cycling down country lanes whistling a tune and he appeared where there had previously been a tragic road accident in which he had been killed and would appear again when there was about to be another accident. The book also included stories of ghosts who showed up at certain critical times in people\u2019s lives that warned them of imminent danger and deterred them from life threatening danger like getting into elevators that then plummeted to the ground killing all those inside except for the person who had been warned by the ghost.

I dont remember why I did it, I think I was like a dumb 8 year old kid at the time trying to rebel.\n\nWell... my grandfather had this really deadpan sense of humor and as a kid I never really knew when he was joking. We visited his house, and I was in the other room playing with cars or soldiers or something and then I overhear my grandpa saying to my dad, \"New beds eh? Hope them tags still on. Tag police been awful thirsty lately and fixin to arrest anyone that pulls them tags.\"\n\nI was absolutely mortified, and I walked out and said, \"the... tag police?\" And then he started going into detail about the rank and file of the tag police. He said he was close friends with the tag sheriff who was sniffing down some alarms that went off recently. Then I started balling my eyes out and confessed that I ripped off the tags from my bed. Then instead of like coddling me and telling me the truth like most people would do to a crying kid hes just like, \"ohohoho.... oiy ye done fucked up now.\"",

And we're building our own little perfectly-legal slave army every day.  Resources?  What can they get on Earth that they can't get anywhere else?  We've already proven that water is abundant in the universe, so it can't be that.  Any other material could probably be created once you've figured out cold fusion.  You could just systematically demolish entire planetary systems to get the resources you'd need.  And if they wanted our resources, don't you think they would just plop down a moon-sized ship and take them?  I mean, what are we going to do about it?  If there's anything that we have that they want, they'd just take it.  Or are we some kind of science experiment?  What kind of science experiment would last over 120,000 years or more?  I'm sure after a few centuries, they'd grow bored of their experiment and move on to something else.",

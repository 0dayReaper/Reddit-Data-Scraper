Certain fees may apply if the case capsizes for whatever reason but it seems unlikely due to how you  stated the issue. Find a decent firm, not just someone that advertised a lot. You can shop around and find a better deal saying \"oh firm x said they do this amount.\" Don't be full of shit about it though.\n\nCheck the statute of limitations for your state, if it is beyond that they likely can't do anything. As far as I know, if it is filed before the statute of limitations is exceeded the case may proceed, this may not be applicable to every state. Last, insurance companies can be shit heads. If someone contacted them and your friend say they were \"fine\" it may muddy the waters. \n\nIt's a pretty convoluted process and hiring a good attorney to navigate through it is critical. If it is an injury that may be present for an extended period of time make sure the settlement addresses that. Make sure your friend understands the process and what they are signing. Good attorneys are thorough as it is important for their business. Best of luck.\n\n\nOh yeah and r/legaladvice\n\nEdits: words and formatting\n\nEdit 2: /u/almostbobsaget had a great write-up.

Also not a lawyer and these are just some things I\u2019ve observed over the years. \n\nFirst thing - if you\u2019ve already filed a claim with the responsible party\u2019s automobile insurance and settled said claim, there\u2019s not much you can do. \n\nSecondly, be aware of state laws governing automobile insurance. In some states you will almost always go through your own automobile insurance for any treatment related to an automobile accident. \n\nAn attorney will typically charge a fee of between 30% and 40% of your overall settlement.  They will also reimburse other parties from this settlement, including medical providers, your health insurance and sometimes your own automobile insurance. Your attorney might state they can recover x-amount, but consider how much you actually owe other parties when any amount is offered and/or accepted.\n\nEdit - if you\u2019re severely injured, also check the responsible party\u2019s bodily injury coverage limits on their auto policy. I think most states have mandated minimum limits (something like ~~$30,000~~ $15,000 per person, ~~$50,000~~ $30,000 per accident). Lots of people only carry the minimum limits mandated by the state, so that\u2019s the most you\u2019d be able to obtain from that party\u2019s coverage.\n\n**My advice - don\u2019t trust others on the road and consider upping your own medical coverage on your own policy to make sure you aren\u2019t just carrying minimum coverage.** And if you\u2019ve ever seen a personal injury attorney\u2019s ad claiming they obtained millions of dollars for their client, those results are not typical and are very rare. Usually, those cases involve a horrific injury and a commercial insurance policy with millions of dollars of coverage available. \n\nEdit 2 - As a few people pointed out, limits seem to be lower in most states. I\u2019m most familiar with Texas, which had $30,000 per person. \n",

The flex and jello-like reactions from relaxed muscles really do help in absorbing damage.\n\nMy physical therapist was telling me about it, and how many drunken people in similar situations come out much better, as the reaction time between brain/muscle is slower which leads to them only tensing up after the inital hit. \n\nTo edit for clarity: Tensing is good for things like fistfights, where impacts are too weak to tear flesh. We werent built to get clapped by a car going 75mph. Our reaction is the same, as a defense mechanism, but it just makes things worse for extreme impacts like that.",

Like how tf are these old fucks mot in prison yet?! It seems like the punishments are so inconsistent. Like your first offense is super strict but if you get 10 it's nbd apparently???",

The only reason it hasn't been given the same level of zero tolerance, automatic criminal record treatment is because the lawmakers all know they do it, too. \n\nOf course, it's getting harder to do that now that all cars have touchscreens and apps. Is there a difference between attempting to change your Spotify song on a touchscreen while driving and texting on one? Probably not. The horrible touchscreen interface in my parents' Honda from a couple years ago makes changing the audio source unnecessarily distracting and difficult, even for someone as used to modern tech as I am. You can't do it without taking your eyes off the road.\n\n",

Stayed at a Roadway Inn for $30 a night.  Front desk clerk was high on benzos or something she was way out there lost in space.  Then I see 30 people who are long term waiting in the parking lot.  It was then that I took all of my stuff from my car inside.  Then I go outside and see a bum shooting heroin.  The icing on the cake was a slow driving Mercedes.  When it drove passed me there was an ass pressed against the window in a pink thong and a head bobbing up and down.  Went to the front desk clerk who said that it was normal and happened all of the time.\n\nSecond time was going to a buddy's wedding in Melbourne.  Again, long term residents but I said whatever.  Went for a walk that morning and next to a pond was a set of needles in a leather pouch neatly left by a tree.  Went back that evening and a guy is walking away in handcuffs with two cops.\n\nGood movie to watch to get an idea of motel life in Florida is the 2017 movie \"Florida Project.\"  It's a frighteningly accurate portrayal",

They are taxed without representation, the very thing we as Americans fought a war with great Britain over. I don't give a shit if people are living here \"illegally\", through arbitrary land borders. They're fucking human beings, no different than us. Aren't you lucky to whine about taxes while the people who happened to be born in a different country than you through no fault of thier own, pick your food and are poisoned in the fields for dollars a day.\nPoverty is a construct used as a tool for fear, you always have somewhere to fall and someone worse off than you to blame with moral failings for being poor. Let them in, prop them up, poor people are forced to spend all thier money surving, sending more money is good for the economy. A good economy is good for everyone.\n\nImmigrants aren't to blame for our country's problems. Getting rid of them would cripple us. I live in an area with migrant workers passing through picking olives and cherries. Nobody else will do it. They've tried. If they don't come through, they don't get picked and prices skyrocket. The local economy booms with the sudden influx of people needing supplies and spending money. I sell a moderate luxury good and Make more money when people have disposable income.\n\nAnd how are you supposed to fix a wound when one party keeps ripping the band aid off before it's ready?",

I like the smaller number of cars and people here, and I don't want to live somewhere more densely populated. \n\nThe existence of my neighborhood is not the problem, it's the lack of affordable housing and transport in general. Changing zoning to allow for the efficient construction of public transport and affordable housing is a worthy goal, but in no way precludes the continued existence of single family home neighborhoods.",

According to the 2020 census, Manhattan's population density is 79,918 people per square mile and according to the 2022 Japanese census, Shibuya's population density is 41,800 people per square mile.\n\nThe mathematical disparity between 2,500 ppsm and nearly 80,000 ppsm is immense on its own.\n\nPeople complain about *\"Manhattanization\"* in their community, but the range of people required to fill the range between 2,500 and 80,000 is absolutely incredible and is numerically improbable for every area that thinks themselves *\"a small neighborhood in danger of urbanization\"*.\n\n-----\n\nNow, what does this actually mean in terms of the living experience? I'll minorly doxx myself by saying that I live in upstate South Carolina within the greater tri-county area; the average population density of this area is approximately 2160 ppsm. Living here, I know that despite being just over 80% of the requirement of being considered and \"urban environment\", our area is a swaft of open grass fields and forest land, some remote single family home sub-divisions, some denser metro/business districts, and a very large number of empty/unused shipping warehouses all over the place (which is it's own separate subject to talk about).\n\nI did the numbers, all those empty/unused shipping warehouses that I just mentioned, we would technically only need to replace half of them with medium-sided suburb style apartments to tip the whole tri-county area into being a US Census defined \"urban environment\", and those warehouses are themselves so far apart, that in this scenario you most likely would not notice the difference. The amount of land we have in the tri-country area is literally just that big.\n\nA lot of modern walkable suburban city communities area actually very close to the classical 1970's perception of dad driving to work but also kids riding their bikes to the arcade type of community; and they're an incredible far cry from *\"Manhattanization\"*.",

I'll say too that im a \"minority/mixed race\" person and live in NYC for 15+ years and also lived in rural Midwest and suburban areas in the Southwest too.\n\nI've travelled a fair bit around the US and have seen a lot. Annecdotally, I feel like the pushback from housing as displayed in this staterpack is less due to the race of people moving in (are there some racist people, absolutel) but rather most people are complaining about the increase in traffic this will cause to their area and the inevitable raise in cost of living that building more housing will cause. \n\nThe US is indeed very big and mostlly people are concentrated in the coasts. For those in the suburbs, instead of crowding the suburbs even further, why not just build in other areas and spread things out? People don't like to live so congested anyway and only put up with it usually to be near ammeneties and jobs. But if there were alternatives, I think most people would prefer more living space.",

Negros live in them but they do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison\". - MLK\n\nAmericans were supposed to end segregation in the 60s yet all you guys do is talk about 'white people' or 'minorities' because your upper class manipulates you guys with this racist drivel.\n\nI live in Canada. We never segregated black people. Natives on the other hand are a different story. MLK liked Canada because people like him could just move here, be Canadian, and not have to listen to 'white people' perpetually talk about them like they're not part of your country.\n\nMost cities in North America have an urban core largely filled with low income 'minorities' who were fighting for integration for decades. In the 50s, developers, realtors, construction companies got together to create the suburbs. They created freeways and wiped out streetcars and public transit for cars and suburban sprawl.\n\nNowadays many cities are maxed out, and working class people can't afford housing or cars anyways, so their new goal is gentrification. Taking over inner city low income communities, revamping them with trains and bike lanes and condos with premium countertops and appliances to appease suburban kids turning into the new yuppies.\n\nRich people don't live in the suburbs. They live in gated communities and private areas that are usually more out of the way from the poors. This new push to revamp the suburbs and all that is just a scam by the same people who created the suburbs in the first place. They're the ones that used racist tricks like blockbusting and redlining to keep Americans divided and 'minorities' stuck in the slums.",

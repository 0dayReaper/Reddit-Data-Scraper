Brad Taste in Music criticized her music as well as talked about the rape allegations against her over the span of a few videos and all her fans could do was call him ugly rather than even attempting to rationalize the situation.\n\nYet again, I don't expect a 14 year old music stan be capable of critical thinking.",

Fast forward to this year, Brad mentioned the allegations in a video (which was how I first learned about them), and with more people learning about the situation, eventually Heller acknowledged the attention and thanked Brad for the support. No legal action of any sort has happened as far as I know and Melanie still kinda flew under the radar.",

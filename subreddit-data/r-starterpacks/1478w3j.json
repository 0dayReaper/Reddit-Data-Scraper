The foundation came pre-cracked and the roof leaks, the kitchen is uneven, and the cheap faux-wood flooring is already starting to lift because of all the moisture that got to the subfloor. Can't afford to get anyone out to fix it, keeps saying he's going to do it himself on the weekend but it's so tired by the time the weekend comes that it never gets done and just keeps getting worse.\n\nLoves showing off his F-150 King Ranch, never tells anyone it's on a 96 month note and he's going to pay three times the truck's value in interest before it's paid off... assuming he doesn't trade it in early to roll the negative equity into a new car note in a couple of years. Complains loudly about how real Americans can't afford gas anymore. Financed a cheap lift and giant tires.\n\nMarried high school sweetheart after getting her pregnant the night of graduation (and two or three times afterwards.) Isn't terribly happy with her and flirts with the waitresses at the local Hooters every Friday afternoon (substitute Waffle House or Huddle House if town too small for a Hooters.) Spends as much time as he can out of the house at friend's deer/fishing camp to get away from his family.\n\nWorks as a tradesman, talks a lot about how much money you can make in the trades, ignores that the people making that money are either at union shops or vanishingly rare. Hates unions, anyway. Makes $60k, which he calls \"pretty good money.\" Some months can't make all the bills and puts the rest on a credit card that he makes minimum payments on. No health insurance, kids haven't seen a doctor since a couple months after they were born except for mandatory school physicals/shots.\n\nLow key but growing pill addiction from when he hurt his back but couldn't afford to rest for a week. High key alcohol problem that he plays off as \"just blowing off steam with the guys.\" Doesn't consider himself an alcoholic because he hasn't hit his kids like his daddy used to... yet.\n\nComplains about Democrats giving welfare to the \"urbans,\" and thinks everyone should just pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Idolizes his boss's boss who made up a hundred fake employees to get hundreds of thousands in forgiven PPP loans he used to buy a new electric Hummer. Always finishes rants about government handouts with \"how come they never gave me nothing?\"",

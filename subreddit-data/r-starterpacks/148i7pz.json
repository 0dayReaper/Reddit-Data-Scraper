Like strictly speaking, we're just regular people who happen to be allowed to deal with uncooperative/violent people and patients.\n\nThey still thought they were cops and tended to escalate rather than deescalate during incidents. Two months or so after one of them started, they got fired and sued due to negligent use of their taser. The cherry on top is they also opted out of getting exposed during their taser training",

I love how \"You need to leave\" is on there, like no shit that's what we're paid to be there for, if we didn't do that then the useless guard trope is perpetuated, if we do tell them to leave, we get called \"rent a cop\". In the end, being a security guard really builds your mental fortitude because of everyone hating you, that's why I'll be thankful for the experience but most likely not go back to it or choose more strictly the site I work.",

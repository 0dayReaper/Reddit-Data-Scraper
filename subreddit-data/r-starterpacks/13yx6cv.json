Then again, I guess it depends on if you're looking to preserve those elements of the native one, or it is more of a direct transcription.\n\nFor instance, I use two ways of transcribing one of my conlangs, one of which is more accurate to the way it is actually written in its own form of script, and another which is a more direct phonetic script. The latter is more useful to portray the sound of the language, whereas the former is more useful to transcribe the literal letters. I use the latter, non-phonetic variant when I write that script myself to generate its neography, because I do that by changing its font to a custom one corresponding to that language's script.\n\nSpecifically, it includes grammatical markers that are pronounced differently depending on if they follow a vowel or not. It looks the same in the script but it is pronounced differently, so for \"phonetic\" transcriptions, I use a different transcription.",

For example anime has a problem with their japenese dub occasionally having english words or in them, but the voice actors can have a hard time performing the correct accent. For us it usually just ends up being funny, but I can totally see marginalised people not being so happy with the way their language gets butchered.",

Like in Poland people don't switch to perfect British or American accent while reading an english word or company name.\n\nSimilarly I wouldn't expect an American to pronounce something like \"chrz\u0105szcz\", \"trzcina\", \"\u017ad\u017ab\u0142o\" or \"pi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0119ciogrosz\u00f3wka\" flawlessly.",

For example, English has one 5 vowel letters which combine in a myriad of complicated ways to represent 19 vowel phonemes, which is how you end up with silent e and the end of words, silent vowels everywhere, and a complete inability to tell how the schwa (the a in comma) will be spelled non-word-finally. Also the fact that it has X Q and C equivalents. All of these conventions come from A the fact that English has borrowed an alphabet that was invented for a different language with a different phonology, and B very specific hostorical circumstances.",

But this anachronism issue can also extend to things like the names of the days of the week or the months of the year. These are things that have our specific history and culture literally written into them, so they become nonsense when you try to insert them into a completely foreign context. \n\nSeveral of our weekdays are named after specific figures in Norse mythology. If the characters in your setting don't have those gods, why would they call them that? Likewise, why would the characters in your fantasy setting be using anything like our Gregorian calendar, which was developed by the Catholic church? You shouldn't have a month called \"August\" in a context where Augustus Caesar doesn't exist, or a month called \"July\" without a Julius Caesar. Plain and simple. \n\nIt's passing up an opportunity to be creative or interesting, in favor of the familiar and conventional. It's just kind of lame, that's all.",

The whole M\u00e9xico being pronounced as a soft j it's a medieval spanish from southern spain thing. X at that time represented the letter \"j\" in most uses. The word \"example\" in ancient spanish was \"exemplo\" and was prounounced as modern spanish \"ejemplo\". Hence why X disappeared in most modern spanish uses and replaced with a J in most cases.\n\nAlso in Castillian Spanish (the spanish spoken in Spain) the \"th\" sound exists, with z and c when in front of ce or ci (e.g. \"cepillo\" , in latin american is widely pronounsed as /sepiyo/ , in mainland Spanish is /thepiyo/ -- and the words \"casar\" and \"cazar\" that mean different things , sound exactly the same in latin american spanish despite meaning wildly different things, something that doesn't happen in mainland spanish as it would be /kasar/ and /kathar/). Greek has also this sound too (\u03b8 theta letter) and many other languages. \n\nBut yes I agree with OP , it's carefully tailored to sound exotic to English speakers (their main target audence).",

I guess it depends on the scope of your conlang project. If you're going for something more light-hearted meant to be easy for people, it's usually better with something with similar phonetics and script as we are used to. For things where you're more interested in it being unique and accurate to anatomical attributes of another species than being \"easy to speak for humans\", you go closer to the second route.\n\nEx. I made two constructed languages, one of which is spoken by a group that are effectively just genetically modified people, and another spoken by a mammalian species (not alien, actually), and the former language has phonetics similar to Romance languages, but the latter has dramatically different phonetics and does not have any labial sounds. To make up for a lack of those phonetic sounds, it has ejective variants of other sounds, for instance. It's all dependent on what you want, really, but I 100% agree that I wish more people dared draw inspiration outside of the language they speak.",

            "comment": "As someone who is writing a sci-fi/fantasy story myself, this has honestly become a massive pet peeve of mine. The language is always a 1:1 cipher of Latin (or Japanese if it's an anime/tokusatsu), while the words themselves are just meaningless gibberish to put subtitles to because they're too lazy to hire a linguist or do any research on real world languages.\n\nWhen I decided I wanted to have a constructed language in my sci-fi/fantasy story, I actually did months of research on real world languages. I based the alphabet order (loosely) off of the Greek Alphabet instead of the Latin one, the grammatical structure off of Spanish, Japanese and Arabic, and gave it both capital and lowercase letters along with a 9 digit numeral system. The most exotic sound I even have is \\[\u0263\\], which is not present in English, but is still present in a number of major languages such as Greek and some dialects of Spanish.\n\nAurebesh is one thing, but the Wakandan one especially irritates me because Black Panther is more-or-less set in an alternate history of our world and is basically a cipher for the real world language of Xhosa, and yet it uses the exact same alphabet order as English. This goes against the whole \"Anti-colonialism\" message of the movie (most real world cultures that use the Latin Alphabet and don't primarily speak an Indo-European language were cultures that were colonized at one point). Combine that with the fact that there are already writing systems in Africa such as Ethiopian, N'Ko and Adlam that have VERY different letter orders than that of Latin.\n\nThis is why doing research on such topics is important when writing a sci-fi/fantasy story.",

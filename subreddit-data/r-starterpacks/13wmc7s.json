So the answer to your question is yes.\n\nIn this case, the fluid is air, the precipitate (or sediment) is dust, and the solid body is the casing/grill of the fan. \n\nAnother somewhat common example of fouling is the domestic water supply flowing through the piping in your walls. Domestic water frequently contains some amount of dissolved minerals. Over a large span of time, those minerals will, little-by-little, precipitate out of solution and deposit on the inside walls of the pipes. Because the deposits generally have a rough surface due to the rather random and chaotic manner in which the mineral deposits will form, this causes a lot of turbulence in the flow of water. This turbulence causes a loss in pressure, and thus a loss in flow rate. Compared to a pipe with the same inner diameter as that of the mineral deposits, the fluid flowing through the pipe will be a lot less turbulent due to the smooth surface of the pipe. That is to say, water will flow faster through a smaller pipe with no fouling than a larger pipe with fouling, assuming that the effective inner diameter of the fluid flow path is equal.\n\nSource: bachelors in chemical engineering.

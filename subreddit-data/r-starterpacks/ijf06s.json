John Young - astronaut goddamned legend - snuck a corned beef sandwich into the capsule on his first mission (Gemini 3), and was reprimanded by NASA because of their concern that crumbs and such could've gotten into the flight controls and caused problems. \n\nThey didn't, probably because flight control hardware was built like a tank back then, but still.\n\nI'm hoping that the up-and-coming breed of commercial space stations will allow for humans to be a little more themselves in space. The ISS is a marvel of engineering, but it is *ruthlessly* ~~form over function~~ function over form [mah bad].",

Most star treks have a more diverse cast than this:\n\n* TOS had a black female in the main cast, and a Scottish and Russian(? Some Slavic background? Chechov) characters as well (most characters in the other shows seem to have American or British accents, I think it's interesting TOS at least shows this a bit)\n\n* TNG had 2 black males and 2 females playing roles in the main cast\n\n* DS9 had a black male as the lead, and 2 females as lead roles (one of them can be considered as transgender, it has to do with the alien race she plays in but I saw somewhere a trans magazine featured this)\n\n* VOY had a female captain, and at least one black character lead (or 2, depending on what the actor who played Torres considers herself as). This show also did a spin-off of Native American culture with the \"Maqui\" cast, although I don't know how much it was based off.\n\n* DIS has a female lead, and a wide cast of main and secondary female cast members, and at least 3 openly gay characters\n\nHowever star trek isn't the perfect example- ENT definitely can fit this stereotype described in this post, as can the JJ movies. The original pilot of TOS was quite different, where Gene Roddenberry imagined a future with sexism and racism still prominent in the future. Luckily he changed that vision to be more about equality and diversity, whether it's with a human cast or a crew of aliens.",

The only blank slate token character on the ship is Harvey, the comms officer (one of the white dudes). He's only there to incite a conflict.  His death is the only one that really doesn't have any weight to it. At least I couldn't care less if he dies or not. All the other characters deaths were pretty significant and did not follow any standard formula. At least for me.",

Lots of overly emotional thousand yard stare flashbacks as he remembers his wife and child who died in a car wreck 10 years ago.\n\nWhite guy 2: goes \u2018way back\u2019 with white guy 1. Astronaut school or whatever. He disagrees with everything and eventually turns on the rest of the crew. He dies in the final act and white guy 1 holds him while he apologizes and says \u201cyou were right\u201d. \n\nWhite guy 3: completely clueless. Has zero business being an astronaut. Only exists for comic relief, but is given a \u201chow do none of you know &lt;insert fact&gt;\u201d in the second act as an attempt to make him seem less useless. Flirts with both women, neither of which reciprocate. \n\nBlack guy: token character in &lt;insert space movie title&gt;. Works as an analyst or systems manager or something that really has little bearing on the story. Completely inoffensive, and white woman seems to have a bit of a crush on him, but nothing happens apart from a very awkward \u2018almost romance\u2019 scene.\n\nWhite woman: tough ex military woman who grew up on a farm with 17 older brothers. Takes no bullshit, and even puts white guy 3 in a headlock after one of his failed flirtation attempts and says \u201cnext time I won\u2019t go easy\u201d. Wears sleeveless shirts and olive cargo pants exclusively. Obsessed with her honor and being the toughest person on the ship. Manages the space lasers. Wants to screw black guy but doesn\u2019t.\n\nAsian woman: onboard to do \u2018calculations\u2019. Never lets any of the crew, or audience for that matter, forget that she is an MIT PhD with multiple degrees. Also secretly a black belt in karate because racist trope. Makes lots of advances toward white guy 1 who, until halfway through the movie, rejects her because he\u2019s \u201cjust not ready to move on.\u201d Tells white guy 3 she will sleep with him if he can answer &lt;insert advanced mathematics trivia question&gt; during the \u2018everyone sitting around drinking and telling stories\u2019 scene. He can\u2019t. \n\nAsian guy: their rebellious ally in mission control. Not actually on the ship, but breaks all sorts of mission control protocol because \u201cthe command doesn\u2019t know what theyre talking about\u201d. Says at least twice \u201cI\u2019m so fired for this!\u201d At one point in the movie he hacks the mainframe of the mission control using a few frantic keystrokes, finishing by saying \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d Always eating at his desk.",

When she asked him if he was on speaker because maybe that's why shes having difficulties, he screamed at her \n\"I shouldn't have to fucking repeat myself you stupid cunt! This is what's wrong with your generation, you're all so fucking lazy!\" \nI made a point to tell him \"your phone was on speaker you rude fuck\" as I left the bus.\n\nTLDR: I fucking hate people",

(well, middle-aged and up)\n\nPeople get a little farsighted with age (i.e. nearer objects become harder to see/blurrier). The lenses in our eyes harden slightly with age and become unable to focus on close objects, the specific condition is called [presbyopia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia)\n\nSo while anything really close in is blurry, it might be in focus at arm's length or so, and holding something further away makes it easier to read. That's also why almost everyone eventually needs glasses for reading, even if they never had eye problems otherwise.\n\nAnd since presbyopia begins in your mid-30s or 40s, it affects all moms. (At least if they children are old enough to look at and share memes on the internet.)",

And no, Edge, Brave and Vivaldi don't fix this problem, because they're all based on Chrome (or, in Edge's case, about to be).",

She comes home over an hour later with lunch, so I ask what took so long.\n\nShe was trying to text me and ask what I wanted from Burger King, but kept making mistakes with the keys, and didn't know how to delete a letter, so she'd restart the whole message (this is back when you had to type each number a few times per letter to send texts) and eventually she just gave up.\n\nNever crossed her mind to just call me after all that, which makes it even funnier, but I still got a burger and fries, so everything worked out.",

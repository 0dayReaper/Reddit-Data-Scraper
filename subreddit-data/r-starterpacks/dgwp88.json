Many of the first gen Pokemon had those more angular \"anime eyes\" so to speak, even Pokemon that are low tier/un-evolved like Voltorb or Exeggcute which if designed today would probably have rounder \"cuter\" looking eyes. The old designs definitely look more 90's anime for sure in their faces, I kinda wish some of the new ones followed similar design principles, particularly in the eyes, just so there still feels like some aesthetic connection between the new and old ones.",

I'd have to either go on having missed an episode, or wait til the series started over and caught back up to that point, weeks and weeks later. \n\nTeaching kids patience is getting harder and harder. Having so many things digitally accessible whenever you want can definitely have some downsides to a developing child.\n\nTyping that last paragraph made me feel older than I've ever felt.

Rain was water that fell from the sky and didn't even require condensers to process.",

Look at Kendrick Lamars to Pimp a Butterfly or Tyler the Creators Flowerboy. The influence of jazz is front and center along with Funk, which I would argue was a form of jazz revival in itself.  An explicitly named Jazz Hip Hop genre emerging in the next few years would just be an evolution on this already extant trend.",

It still has some ugly stuff in the periphery, and the characters are often not open to new things, but in the moment, they are such wonderful people. There are these little moments where Dale says something incredibly nice to Bill, who is not a respected person, and it\u2019s so genuine and nice to see Bill proud. The episode where the womanizing Boomhauer falls in love with a woman who is just using him for sex, and at the end you think he\u2019s over her and going to some ex-flame and he knocks on her door. \u201cBoomhauer? I thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d She says in an impartial mind of defeated way. Then he apologizes in his fast stuttering voice says he knows now how she must feel, and gives her flowers. FUCK. That\u2019s so wonderful.",

There *are* shows that explore the medium; they\u2019re not the norm, but again we\u2019re getting into \u201cthat\u2019s what the word \u2018norm\u2019 means\u201d territory.\n\nAnd to say that a cookie-cutter style is an American phenomenon is just silly.

They\u2019re great at making me laugh, while also not demanding too much of my attention. I would much rather them put more money and focus into writing, rather than animation, because the writing is the part that actually entertains me. It\u2019s cool to have a show like Bojack Horseman that has better animation and good writing, but I feel the need to put everything down and pay full attention when I watch that compared to other shows, therefore shows with quick jokes and lazy animation get way more view time in my house than shows with better stories and animation.",

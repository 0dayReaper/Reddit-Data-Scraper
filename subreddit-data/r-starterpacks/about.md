Description:

Home of starterpacks!

Rules:

Must be a starter pack: Your post must be a starter pack, not a list or any other meme.  Remember:  attributes, not examples.

Be creative: Disallowed posts, jokes that are done to death, recent reposts, slight edits of existing posts, reposts of top submissions are highy frowned upon, and may result in a temporary ban. This rule doesn't explicitly apply to posts involving recent events, only if it's done to death.

Text-only posts, posts simply with examples of an item, and posts about you will most likely be removed.

No blatant bigotry: No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any general discrimination towards anyone of any race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexuality. You can mention them and discuss anyone you want, but do not turn it into a political argument or be a bigot.

Be nice to each other: You don't have to agree with each others opinions, just try to be civil in your discussions.

No politics: Incidental political items in a starter pack are okay, but this sub is not an arena for political agenda posts or political arguments.

Starter packs must contain 2 or more unique images: A starter pack should contain at least two images to make it a valid starter pack. Posts should also not have only different images of the same type of object, or two random images added in to bypass the rule.

Emojis and screenshots of text only do not count.

Post title must include name of starterpack only: Please include your starterpack title in the image itself. This prevents out of context confusion if your starterpack is shared outside of Reddit.

Post must be created by yourself, not a repost: To prevent this subreddit from being flooded with posts that we've all seen a million times before, it is required that anything you post was created by yourself and was not already posted here, found elsewhere on Reddit, or on another website.

Users, if you are aware that the poster of the starter pack is a bot, karma farmer, or spam account, please consider noting that when you report the post and we will ban the account.

Imgur/Reddit image posts only: In order to prevent spam, posts to /r/starterpacks must be submitted as images hosted on imgur or reddit only.

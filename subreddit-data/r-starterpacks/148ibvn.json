This meant eating more at home (which is generally cheaper anyways), and I opted for healthier options when I could (water instead of soda, salads instead of fries, grilled instead of fried, etc). Then over time you continue those incremental shifts until one day you realize you haven't been to a McDonald's in months.\n\nBut I recognize \"Eat less lmao\" may not be an option for everyone, my previous diet was so shitty that doing *anything* would have given me results.",

I always ended up losing motivation after a while and giving up. Here's what actually helped:\n\n1) Download MyFitnessPal/Lifesum/whatever food tracking app. Track everything you eat, absolutely everything, including sauces and the like. For the first 2 weeks to a month, that's the only thing you do, no changes to your diet. Be honest though, if you don't put in everything you eat you're hurting yourself. Doesn't matter if it's 10,000 calories a day, actually building the habit of putting everything is best. If you're not sure approximate but be honest. \n\n2) After the 2-4 week period's over, take a look at how much you eat. Let's say your average is 4000 calories a day. Figure out what you should be at. Let's say that desired value is 2000 calories a day.\n\n3) Start going down by 10% every 2 weeks. If you realized you were at 4000 calories a day, bring it down by 10% to 3600 for 2 weeks. After those 2 weeks, bring it down by 10% again, this time from 3600 cals to 3240 cals. Same thing every 2 weeks until you hit your calorie goal.\n\n4) Do this for the first few 3 months or so, and once you've gotten comfortable and in the habit of both tracking your food as well as being in a calorie deficit, you can start incorporating workouts and exercise if you wish to. \n\n\nEssentially the problem I had all the time is that I had that burst of motivation, went \"ok as of tomorrow, I'm cutting all junk food, eating 2000 calories a day, tracking everything, and exercising 1 hour a day\". That always failed, I'd get overwhelmed and when motivation dropped, so did all the good things I did.\n\nBy splitting them up (\"ok now I'm forming the habit of tracking what I eat\", followed by \"ok now I'm forming the habit of slowly reducing my caloric intake\", followed by \"ok now I'm forming the habit of being more active\"), it helped me a ton with actually following through. \n\nYes, this will \"delay\" your weight loss by a few months, but it's not a race, and forming healthy long-term habits is way better in the long term than losing the weight quick and gaining it back just as quickly. \n\nHope this helps!",

My biggest thing that helped me make a true lifestyle change and not just temporarily lose weight was focusing on protein. I make sure to eat around 130-180g of protein a day at 2000 calories. I feel so much fuller for such a longer amount of time now. Lifting while eating lots of protein has helped me lose mostly fat while keeping the muscle I had. \n\nBefore I lost 90lbs from only doing cardio and it wasn\u2019t sustainable. I ran a 5k at the park 4 days a week. I would binge when I got home and because I wasn\u2019t watching my diet I was skinny fat. Yeah I lost weight a lot faster doing cardio but I gained it back just as fast. Eat protein, lift, and take relaxing walks when you can. It\u2019s changed my life.",

Then try some healthy snacks like low fat yogurt with real fruit and eventually you\u2019ll be \u201cspending\u201d more calories on healthier foods and your protein intake will go up as you choose more higher protein stuff.\n\nI basically did this and don\u2019t need powder or shakes anymore but I did use them for a while and they\u2019re totally fine, just a little pricy.\n\nFor protein amounts aim for 0.7-1.0g of protein per pound of body weight. Unless you\u2019re obese in which case you can try to aim for something like 1g protein per centimeter of height. So 6ft tall is 183cm so you can aim for 183g protein.\n\nCalorie deficit is key for losing fat, so I recommend tracking with MyFitnessPal or similar",

So what this means is that you simplify meals &amp; rotate. Like I can make mung bean dal in a pressure cooker with like under 1 minute active work, incredible macros, incredibly cheap. Variations of chicken breast in oven etc. Make a list of these meals, and you'll know exactly how many calories are in them &amp; the macro splits.\n2. Don't shop while hungry, ideally the store is far enough away that even if you're having insane cravings you'll be too lazy to go there just to buy something bad. The cravings gets less over time anyway. Don't buy stuff which is easy to fall for when craving, like bread, don't buy it. It's much more likely that you're going to make a sandwich than begin a cooking project on the stove.\n3. All food ain't the same, personally low carb is best for me body overall. I also look at caloric density in ingredients, like tomatoes are 90 kcal per lbs, so to reach 1800 kcal I would need to eat 20 lbs of tomatoes, that's pretty much physically impossible, hence it's a good ingredient. \n4. There's nothing wrong with being hungry &amp; you get used to it, eating until you stop being hungry instead of eating until you're completely full is also important.\n5. Reduce meal frequency, there's a ton of research on IF having numerous health benefits in of itself, but it also simplifies eating overall making it easier to stick to imo.\n\nI went from 240 lbs to 150 in half a year by cutting calories to like 1200 on average &amp; swimming multiple times a week using more or less this method like 15 years ago. It's not permanently sustainable of course so you have to make other lifestyle changes, but hoovered around 150 - 180 for over a decade, which is pretty fine weight for my height &amp; muscle.",

I need to lost around 20lbs to be happy. My biggest issue is eating out of boredom. I still struggle with it. One thing I find is if I\u2019m literally doing anything, my boredom hunger disappears. \n\nWhen I\u2019m doing nothing I\u2019m always hungry. \n\nSitting at home watching TV is my biggest boredom eating culprit because it\u2019s pretty brainless. I can play video games for 4 hours and not think about food. But watching a movie I\u2019ll go to the fridge four times. \n\nAny time I get the urge to eat out of boredom I try to replace it with something else even if it\u2019s a 5 minute task. \n\nEven something simple can do the trick. Late night. Watching a movie. Get up to snack. Instead maybe I\u2019ll do 20 push-ups or some pull-ups. The energy takes my mind off snacking. \n\nGoing for walks is a great one. Fasting helps me too. Most of my weight gain is from midnight-3am. I\u2019m a night owl. But with fasting I force myself to stop eating after 8 or 9. I challenge myself to stick to it. I\u2019ll brush my teeth right after my last meal instead of before bed so I don\u2019t go back and eat again. \n\nIt\u2019s all about tricking myself for me. The more I do that isn\u2019t sitting doing nothing, the less I think about food or hunger.",

Prior to this, I worked physical jobs till I switched to IT. This was the first time weighing myself in years. \n\nEverybody loves IT in the office I worked at, so I got lots of chips, soda, donuts, beer oclocks, ordering lunches, etc. All stuff I ate before office life, but I wasn't burning 4k calories a day anymore. \n\n5 months before my wedding (1 week after the bachelor party) I went to get my suit re-fit for the 3rd time that year and the tailor told me if I gain any more weight, I'd have to buy a new suit. \n\nDecided that day, enough is enough. Keto was all the rage at that time, so I decided to give it the old college try. Sugar out, cold turkey. Beer out, cold turkey. No bread, no pasta, no rice, no potatoes. Green veggies, fats, and proteins ONLY. Alcohol only in red wines and low carb cocktails or turbo light beers. \n\nI didn't do any excercise except some walks in the evening and a few hikes here and there (which I did at 225 anyways). I ran a 500-800 calorie deficit a day. \n\nOn my wedding day, I reached my goal of 180lbs. 2 weeks prior to that, the tailor had to take my suit in farther than from when I even first bought it. \n\nBottom line is this worked for me, and my lifestyle. I ate bacon and eggs every day, I had pork rinds as snacks, I drank gallons of water a week. Blood panels came back excellent, and my doctor was shocked at the loss. There's mountains of research for and against, but I had to break my relationship with food. I had to start thinking of my body as a machine, with various levers I can pull to do what I want. \n\nDownside is it can come back, easy. Keto for me is a LIFESTYLE not a diet, not a fad, this is something once you decide to do, you change forever. If you can maintain a calorie deficit with regular foods, go for it. For me, I couldn't. Afternoon carb crash, naps every day, staying up till 2am on a weekday. I lost 10 hours a week to just napping. 40 hours a month. 480 hours a year to NAPPING, just to get through my days. \n\nInstead of being addicted to sugar and other carbs, Im addicted to how good I feel. I stopped snoring. I stopped getting hangry. I stopped getting drunk on beer and bloating. I sleep through the night, I wake up with the sun and wind down into bed at 11pm. I feel like I operate like our ancestors might have. \n\nBe mindful if you do any journey like this - there will be people that say their diet is the chosen one, it's how humans were meant to operate, any sort of downsides is wrong and you are dumb. Do your research, if you find your current lifestyle isn't working for you, find one which does. Try it out. It takes discipline, motivation, and the desire to live for more. \n\nBest advice is just decide, one day, to try something for two weeks. That's how I started. I NEEDED a change, more than I needed that beer. I wanted to make my wedding day the day I felt, looked, and was the best version of myself.\n\nFor me it was food, for you it might be daily walks, different types of foods, exercise routines, whatever. Track your progress with apps if you need to. Focus on how you are feeling, not the number on the scale. Best of luck.",

Whether that's going to the gym, walking, running, biking, swimming, etc. Do you like any of those?\n\nTracking calories is what is effective and as others have said protein will make you feel more satiated. Also, if you drink alcohol cut it way down, alcohol is a calories bomb and leads to bad eating usually. Start tracking your calories on MyFitnessPal or something similar and you will see where you are having trouble.\n\nMy best advice though is moderation and that one good decision leads to another, one bad decision leads to another. When I gain or lose weight I know what I did right or what bad decisions I made. Also, don't beat yourself up too much when you have a bad day or have been inactive for a bit. The important thing is to get back on the horse, don't let that bad day or streak become permanent.",

But I started very strict calorie counting and waking up at 5am every weekday to work out for 1 hour.\nI stuck to 1200 cal/day (mostly) and lost 35kg in 6-9 months.\n\nThe calorie restriction was what made me lose weight, the exercise was just so I didn\u2019t lose too much muscle - didn\u2019t really work that well I lost a LOT of muscle but I\u2019ve heard this can\u2019t really be helped when you\u2019re losing weight that fast.\n\nIn terms of diet, I usually ate no breakfast (I feel sick if I eat in the morning) a yoghurt for morning tea, a salad or 2 min noodles(lazy) for lunch and maybe some nuts or a muesli bar. I\u2019d change it up sometimes but that was pretty standard. Dinner was a 400-500 cal frozen meal. And then an early night usually around 8pm.\n\nNo cheat meals.\nExcept for 1 birthday meal which was tacos with not much meat and I didn\u2019t eat anything else that day.\nIt was ok to slip up accidentally but I had to get straight back on it if I did.\n\nI\u2019ve been maintaining a good weight since then but it\u2019s a constant daily struggle to not over eat and it\u2019ll be this way for the rest of my life.\n\nI don\u2019t feel full after eating until at least several hours later so I don\u2019t trust my brain chemicals that are constantly screaming at me to eat everything in sight.\nThe only thing that has helped this is a lot of exposure combined with meditation. I tell myself \u201cit\u2019s ok to feel hungry, I am not dying (I am), I don\u2019t NEED food right now (I do), and when I do eat I don\u2019t need to eat much and it can easily be healthy (not true I need to eat a whole packet of chips right NOW)\n\nI grew up not having enough food so these mental pathways are strong for me.\n\nYou already have everything you need to do it.

Its a lot easier to start working out when you're not overweight, so from personal experience I recommend losing the weight first through intermittent fasting, then worry about getting healthy/fit. Start skipping meals/fasting for a day and replacing food with ice cubes, sugar-free gum, black coffee, and a shit ton of water. A nicotine habit helps. I lost 70 pounds in 6 months doing this, all while not working out and still eating whatever I wanted when I did eat (although I did quit soda).\n\nEDIT: specified sugar-free",

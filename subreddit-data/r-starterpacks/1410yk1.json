Generally, traditionally the South is considered a land of tradition and the last holdout of some Old World ideas. This can be good in some respects. There\u2019s the idea of the Southern Gentleman, the Southern Belle, Southern hospitality, etc. It also has the heritage of poor social mobility, racism, debutant balls, nepotism, and poor education. The last two contribute to the stereotype of local governance being less efficient and less effective. \n\nThe North has generally been more progressive and industrial, people walk faster, talk faster, adopt new ideas faster, and before the collapse of the manufacturing sector, they built cities faster. Northerners may not make eye contact with their neighbors but they want their neighbors to have a nice house and good job prospects. But, other than a few very old cities on the coast like Boston and New York, Northern cities are largely seen as generic, interchangeable, and without character.",

Don't get me wrong, tons of culture there - different ones, from different places. And it is slowly giving it its own character. But it still felt like a newly opened store or something, fresh and not worn in. Because there was basically nothing there a mere 80 years ago.",

Those Kentuckians who fought for the CSA (most fought for the North, but it was not a trivial amount of Confederate volunteers) mostly did so because they bought CSA propaganda that the North was deliberately trying to use free blacks to disenfranchise poor whites and take their jobs, destroying their society.",

The eastern part of Texas is the westernmost extension of the Deep South, while North Florida is also part of the Deep South region, typically the area north of Ocala.",

Go ask the Uyghurs if racism exists in socialist China. Go ask the Roma how socialist Europe is treating them. Truly high school political philosophy at its finest.\n\nWhat ends racism is humanizing people so other people don't just see them as their race but as individuals. In that way representation in media (good, well-written, stereotype-breaking media that is, not corporate quota-filling ham-fisted media obviously) is absolutely helpful in changing hearts and minds. For every empty gangster rap act or trap mumblerapper glorifying sex drugs and money there's socially conscious rappers like Kendrick, Lupe, Talib, etc. Is it the only or biggest solution? Of course not, but every little bit helps.",

I still vividly remember when my orthodontist offered to only remove 2 during my appointment at that time and the other 2 on another one and I told her to just get rid of all 4 of them in one shot as I wasn't willing to extend the period of pain that I was going to be in. IIRC, I received at least 4 local anesthetic injections in total, 1 for each wisdom tooth. I wasn't even given any kind of sedative so I was wide awake and fully conscious during the entire thing.\n\nThe surgery process, if anything, was just as painful as the weeks of recovery from it. I couldn't eat anything that required some form of chewing for at least a month or so. The funny thing is that I wasn't even prescribed a painkiller of any sorts post-surgery so it was a matter of me just dealing with random, yet excruciating mouth aches every now and then during the recovery period\n\nHonestly though, it was worth getting them removed if it means I don't have to deal with any serious oral or dental complications that could arise from not getting them removed.",

I remember just about the whole thing, including when he asked me, \"wanna see?\" And I said \"hhhhffufgmmm\" so he held up his pliers(?) With my bloody tooth in it. Afterwards, no painkillers, no puffing, not even any pain at all. Immediately after the surgery I got up and walked myself down a set of metal spiral stairs, which I underestimated the riskyness of. I got to keep my teeth, which I turned into jewelry :)",

By the time I had my wisdom teeth out at 19, I\u2019d already had two oral surgeries, one at 9 to extract 6-7 baby teeth that hadn\u2019t fallen out and then another at 14 to extract my  4 baby molars and one permanent tooth so I could get braces. I also had 5 wisdom teeth so that was a fun surprise for the surgeon \ud83d\ude02",

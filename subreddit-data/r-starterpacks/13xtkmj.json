So the significant expenses are gone. 12-13 Is not a lot but enough; it just depends on where you want to travel and how well you can and acceptable to cut expenses like hotel, transport etc.\n\nI know people that just buy cheap tickets and live a week with a family that invites foreigners to stay with them. Or you can buy an old car or van. You can throw out the car seats in the back of a small van, put in a madres and simple cookware and travel that way.\n\nIf you start saving some of the money each time by like 10%, it will earn up over time and in the meantime you can start planning, a planned trip will be less expensive. \n\nThe economy will always be crazy, but having a well-paid job, just means I got less. It is much worse for the people that already had big expenses like 2-3 kids that are in their teenage years, that eat a lot got more expensive.\n\nA lot of people use debit cards because \"they need a vacation\" even if they can't afford it. Don't focus too much on what \"other people do\" but instead on what you want to do.",

I make $30/h and one check of the month barely pays rent. \n\nI hated having roommates in college but this is just KILLING me, I\u2019m going to ask my brother to sign a lease with me. Anything to get out of this loop please. It\u2019s either that or\u2026 work an extra 20 hours, and that means down time from work I\u2019ll always be to tired to do anything but lay around my place.",

            "comment": "Probably the most valuable thing I learned in college was time management skills. I was a full time student, a member of the rowing team, and worked part time. My rowing coach was really big on time management, because without it he'd have rowers missing practice whenever they had a big paper or a test coming up. If I wanted to be competitive on that team while also maintaining good grades and earning money, I'd have to use my time pretty wisely. At the end of the day you have to set priorities and stick to them. If your main priority is just getting through the workday so you can go home and watch TikToks, then that's what you'll do. But if you tell yourself that you need to take 30 minutes per day to do basic chores and 30 minutes to do a workout (doesn't have to be at a gym, I workout at home most of the time), then you'll do those things before sitting on your phone. Some days will require more work than leisure, unfortunately that's modern life. But if you manage your time well, especially on those days, you should be able to set aside full off-days for whatever you want to do, which will give you something to look forward to in the days leading up to it, and rejuvenate you for the days afterwards so you don't feel so burned out. Life is what you make it, and there's a lot of really easy ways to waste all that time if you let yourself do it. So take that time, put it towards something useful that prioritizes you, and start building free time to fill with hobbies, leisure, etc.",

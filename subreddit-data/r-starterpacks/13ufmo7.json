I feel more connected to my community (and more focused ON my community) because I have this wonderful little person and I want to be sure they have a great place to be. \n\nI think it is hard to describe. My experience has been (thus far) extremely positive. When I garden, I plant my tomatoes excited to see how my kiddo will like them. There is an extra layer of meaning and purpose to growing some tomatoes on the deck. When I wind down after work, I get to spend some quality time with my kiddo and see what they have been learning. That time feels *rich* and magical. Instead of spending that time on my phone, I have this cool person I can connect with, mentor and seeing how they change is just the coolest.\n\nThey don't remove your problems and there are challenges! Kids never made anything easier is very, very true. But... I've found it to be worth it. \n\nI hope you find some peace with that struggle though, feeling like a burden is terrible. If it were my kiddo saying as such, I'd tell 'em that they are like HDR or turning a video from 720p to 4k. They're the best decision I ever made and the thing I am proudest of in life (and I've done some cool shit). \n\nI live a richer, happier, and more fulfilling life for having my little buddy around and I'd make every decision the same way in life to be sure I had that kid around.\n\nChildren become people, and people become complex and multidimensional... but I don't think the words love and pride can convey what it is.\n\nAlso a note: the word deserve here should be absolutely stricken. Totally remove it and the concept behind it - there is no measuring what is deserved or not deserved. You can't do, I can't do it. There's no yardstick of \"worthy &amp; unworthy\", it doesn't exist. You've been given a gift (being a child) and almost anything you do with it is totally fine. It sounds like you love your mom a lot, write her a card (it can be a sentence or two) and mail it to her. It'll make her day, week and maybe month.",

                                    "comment": "I was the opposite of a burden to my mother. She adored me and my siblings and had said many times (and I truly believe her) that being our mom was the best thing in her life and the most fulfilling experience. She was a sahm and absolutely loved it. She was kind of a questionable parent for other reasons, but she definitely loved having kids. She always wanted kids though, and always loved taking care of things. \n\nI know that I definitely inherited that. I don\u2019t have kids yet, but the one thing I\u2019ve always wanted most in life is to be a mother. I adore kids. I\u2019ve worked in childcare and enjoyed it. I have basically endless patience for them. I just find them so adorable and sweet. I feel like the reasons I want kids are twofold. One, I have a strong maternal instinct and desire to have children and care for them. I think it would be an amazing fulfilling experience. They will be the opposite of a burden for me :). \n\nAnd also: it\u2019s almost like a project. I really really really want to have kids and be a really good parent to them, and choose a very good husband to have them with so they have a good father too, and then give them a wonderful childhood and wonderful life and see how good and happy of a human I can raise. I feel like having a happy loving calm childhood is such a wonderful thing. I want to give that experience to someone and give them lots of wonderful memories and lots of resources when they grow up. That\u2019s why I work hard career wise so I\u2019ll have money for a nice house, good private schools, etc. My boyfriend has the same mindset. He works really hard at his career so he has resources for his future family (and traveling but that\u2019s a separate thing). He also sees it like raising children/a family is the ultimate meaningful human experience. I\u2019ve genuinely wanted them (with a strong desire) since I was a little kid playing with dolls. I am absolutely positive that I won\u2019t see them as a burden. I literally write letters to them now when I feel like I can\u2019t wait to have them. My mom genuinely never felt like we burdened her, and she always saw motherhood as the best part of her life. She has other passions and hobbies now and lots of other fulfillment, but being a mom is still something she loves. And she did basically all of the childcare herself. And she now spends her time writing books, reading, traveling with my stepfather, etc. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want kids, please don\u2019t have them. It\u2019s so cruel to raise children in a home that isn\u2019t loving and healthy. But some of us do want them, and those are the reasons why for me. All people are different and experience the world differently, have different personalities and opinions, etc.",

(and Blue's Clues taught sign language as well!)\n\n\n\nIt helps kids communicate. It's a visual aid, it helps if they can't pronounce the word. It helps them remember the word.\n\n\n\nI'll start by saying my daughter could talk, but she wasn't communicating until she started watching Ms. Rachel for a while. Now she's very commutative. She asks for things \"more\", by saying the word and doing the  sign language sign for it. (It's actually what that kid is saying in the meme LOL). Among other signs like, again, milk, bath, play time, toys, all done, outside, open, on, off. Just so many things that helps you as a parent on what your child wants, by teaching your child how to communicate what they want.\n\n\n\nMs. Rachel is doing wonders for parents. Instead of watching fucking coconelon all day and having bad temper tantrums and not communicating, Ms Rachel is having kids SAY WHAT THEY WANT, AND CLEARLY, AND IF THEY CANT TALK CLEARLY, THEY ARE SIGNING IT.\n\n\n\nShe is also helping autistic children by teaching them sign language, as they are some forms of autism that gives kids speech problems/delay. The sign language helps immensely. The techniques she uses are the same speech therapist use to help children with autism.",

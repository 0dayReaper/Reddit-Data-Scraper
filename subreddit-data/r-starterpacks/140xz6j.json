With some streetcar lines coming less than every 5 minutes. By the 20s we had the best transit and biking infrastructure in the world. \n\nThe Depression and War really messed up the housing market and dealt a death blow to the private transit operators. There was also a housing shortage right after WWII since the Depression and then war led to less housing being built. \n\nDying trolley lines led to more drivers, which led to more traffic and even worse transit. Then the feds offered home loans to white GIs and Levittown style developments allowed for the white flight. Black homes were destroyed for highways and derelict buildings torn down for parking.",

Maybe it would\u2019ve been a little bit less if I could catch the connecting bus, but the connecting bus would have already left by the time I got there. Then after that bus trip, it would be another mile and a half walk to the office building, so another 20 min walk. There was a bus stop in front of the office, but this connecting route only travels one way, so it would take a whole hour to loop back to the office stop, so it would be quicker for me to just walk there. \n\nLuckily I had a ride on the way back which was a 20 min car drive away, but I was not so lucky when I had to work on public holidays where the bus wouldn\u2019t run that day so I\u2019d either ask for time off in advance, call out, or one occasion: 5 or 6 hour long walk to work. \n\nTl;dr version: Public transportation sucks if you don\u2019t live in a major city!",

Rent seems to range from $1,000 to $2,000 more dependent on the age of the apartment rather than location.\n\nPrices are rising in Buffalo too in the popular neighborhoods, but the cool thing has been all the up-and-coming areas popping up. Often areas with old walkable commercial districts in various states of disrepair seeing new life as people move back into those areas. Neighborhoods like the Westside, Blackrock and even South Buffalo are good choices if you want walkability without the prices of the more gentrified neighborhoods like Elmwood or Allentown.",

When you factored in parking, laundry, etc., it was close to $2,500/month before any utilities. \n\nBut...we lived next to a subway stop, so for $2.25 I could be anywhere in and around Boston, all within ~15-20 minutes. \n\nSo my wife and I moved just outside of Boston, to a highrise. This had the best of both worlds. We had a bigger apartment, parking was included, washer/dryer in our unit, and still walking distance to a subway. This subway took 30 minutes to get into Boston proper though, and overall, our space was limited. To buy a single family home in this area would cost, at minimum, $750,000. School system is okay for when we have kids, but not great.\n\nSo we moved further out to get more space. Now it's a 45 minute train ride that costs $10.25, or a 40 minute drive. But our house was more affordable and we don't worry about our mortgage payment. Great schools for our kids, and close to the beach so there is at least *some* form of entertainment. But...super far from Boston (relatively), and definitely not a walkable town. \n\nSo our kids will have a typical suburban life, like the one in the starterpack. \n\n\n\nI grew up in Israel - all of my friends/family there live in tall highrises/apartments either in or just outside big cities (well, Tel Aviv). There are buses that take you downtown that come every 15 minutes, and an app for navigating those. The train and lightrail (also coming soon) are also great options. \n\nThese high-rise neighborhoods are built around public transit stops, and new stops are added to further accomodate. They have green areas between the buildings, like playgrounds, parks, and soccer fields for the kids, and people are accustomed to living in a 3 bedroom/1,000 SQFT apartment. Kids learn to take transit alone, at a very young age, and can easily go see friends, grab stuff from a convenience store, or even take the bus into the city. \n\nThe problem in America is that people got used to having a house and a car. We refuse to build vertically, and we hate the idea of public transit. It's very hard to get people who grew up in 2,500 SQFT homes to accept raising kids in small apartments. And those apartments don't have green spaces FOR the kids, so it's hard to fault them. Combine that with non-existent transit, and of course everyone desires the suburban life. \n\nThe mold is breaking a bit in \"newer\" cities, where there is more space to build, but even then it's mostly single-family developments and urban sprawl.",

                    "comment": "Because that's where the houses are. 1950s onward urban planning/design in the US and large parts of Canada left these massive pockets of suburbia around a downtown core. American car-focused culture didn't put a ton of value in street cars, buses and public transit the way European cities did (and continue to do). They assumed everyone would have a car. American consumers /wanted/ cars back then and the assumption that everyone wanted a detached single family home with a lawn and a garage prevailed for another 50+ years. \n\nLiving in a high density metro area (outside NYC, the city of Chicago, Boston) isn't possible for many people. Housing stock may simply not exist as, in many cities, premiums were put on office space and commercial/retail space over apartments. Available apartments may not be suitable for families, retirees, or people starting out. AirBNB made a big impact on desirable buildings in many cities, so the vacancy rates are low, the available housing stock is low, and therefore everything gets much more expensive where it exists. \n\nA 2 BR apartment in the downtown area of my city costs around $3,000 -- and that's not a luxury build by any means. Building policies didn't use rent caps or affordable housing as priorities, and the new builds tend to be at a much higher price point. Supply and demand economics basically means unless you rent from a slumlord, landlords can charge pretty much whatever they like. \n\nWhy not increase public transit? There's a perception in many areas that public transit is for the poor or non-desirable. Investment in infrastructure projects is expensive and difficult. Look at how few rail projects get off the ground in the US or Canada. We've spent *years* fighting for a few more stations in my city, against a ton of NIMBYism. Slapping more bus stops and bus routes in would be the number one easiest way to improve public transit but again, there's high resistance to increased traffic or putting money into transit instead of elsewhere. City government budgets are already stretched and throwing 10 more buses to increase or encourage ridership is tough, especially in cities where there's little culture of public transport. Several Midwestern cities I've been to fall into this category; people just don't take buses to work and the idea of doing so isn't really palatable per different studies or anecdotal responses. \n\nDo we need to change the culture? Yes. Do we need more transit and less sprawl? 100%. Is it affordable and accessible? No, it's really not.",

Every intersection or crossing adds a bunch of stress, you are risking your life and hoping that people driving both see you and decide to follow the law (and even if someone is looking directly at you, they may still not be \"seeing\" you). The noise level is absurd, you can barely hear yourself think over road noise. You get coated in grime, road dust, and exhaust. There are few things more pleasurable than walking up a giant hill and inhaling lung-fulls of exhaust (/s). There is often no shade or protection from the elements, it's just bare, exposed concrete that is 20 degrees hotter than anywhere else.

But also I don't use third party apps and don't think it's as big a deal as half the subs here are making it seem. They're more or less taking away a personalization choice. If you asked the people leading the blackout, you'd think they're dressing as Nazis in the street while kicking puppies and kittens.\n\nAlso, as a software dev, who hasn't checked because it isn't worth the effort but has done similar things in the past... Shouldn't it be possible for third party apps to mimic the official app (or the website) when communicating with the API in order to bypass the limitations? Normally this happens using some key that the app has to send to the server. Just \"borrow\" their key and you should be golden.",

Because I am not entirely sure what you are trying to say here. \n\nAre you under the impression that this is just about third party apps being paid while reddit eats the API costs? Because most people agree that it would be fair if there is *some* cost towards using the API above certain thresholds. One of the issues though is that reddit has chosen payment rates for API usage that are well above anything besides twitter since Musk charges for API usage. \n\nAnyway, if I got that correctly you also managed to cherry pick one very specific thing from four different posts/comments I linked. So, it seems to me you already made up your mind. Hopefully others do find the resources I linked useful though.",

They cannot comprehend that not everyone likes Apollo, even when the numbers say that the majority of Reddit users are on the official app.\n\nBoth spez and the Apollo dev have said that API costs will be roughly $2.50 per month per user. Judging by how determined Apollo fans are, they should have no problem with paying $2.50 or $5 a month for their app.\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve always used the official app and never had an issue with it, so I\u2019ll be keeping my Reddit Premium subscription and ignoring the blackouts.

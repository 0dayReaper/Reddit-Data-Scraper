It was a small division 3 university, and the athletes gym was quite small, low tech, and cramped compared to the brand new student rec center, which had a big sprawling, window covered gym. They closed our gym for a week so we had to go do our lifts in the student gym, and realized how much appreciated the restriction. So many assholes and dbags who were seemingly there only to show off or shout towards their friends and other gym goers, about whatever was on their mind. Also, so much unsolicited \"advice\" from them. Our workouts came from a team that had multiple phds on it, but apparently the YouTube videos they watched made them the real experts on what tennis players or shotput throwers needed (it was bicep curls and bench press to build bulk every day apparently)",

Some of those high school prep schools cost more than ivies, at least they did when I was growing up \n\nA lot of the Ivies do have huge endowments and are often able to give middle class kids (not just poor kids) financial assistance \n\nCornell for instance is also a \u201cland grant university\u201d meaning it received federal funding subsidies for some of its studies at its public schools (like the Ag school and industrial labor relations school) and therefore had tons of poor kids from nearby farms, etc etc",

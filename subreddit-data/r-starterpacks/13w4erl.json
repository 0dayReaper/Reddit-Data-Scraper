It feels like everyone has a different answer when you ask people what her ethnicity is supposed to be. I think the creator didn't confirm it, so yeah...I guess it depends on who you ask. lol",

I may have watched the TV show (I remember Magical DoReMi and Winx Club from the same block), but never saw the movie (I didn't go to the movies when it was out, likely because my parents were worried that I'd sneak into The Simpsons Movie, which came out around the same time).",

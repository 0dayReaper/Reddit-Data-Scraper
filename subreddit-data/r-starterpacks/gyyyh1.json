Like woah, you sprayed around a pre cut out shape and then peeled off the shape!\n\nIt was one thing when people were using several stencils and layering them, or else just combining a bunch of random stuff to use as their stencil but making a coherent image in the end. But I haven't seen one like that that wasn't a repost in like ten years.\n\nNow it's all just planets and outlining Disney characters.",

Impressionist landscapes with flat grounds, warm colors, wide blue skies, and red barns placed off-center and in the mid-ground - people *love* those red barns. I mean they're still great, I love those paintings, but there are a lot of them by now. But when art is your life, you need to make it sell. And those pieces fit nicely in a family home that has the money to spend thousands on wall art. \n\nShe still does her own thing, but the grind is real - you gotta produce what people buy. And when your work is art, art can become somewhat rote work too.",

One was red and white but red is often not used in lighthouses and they strongly evoke the sea. The sea is traditionally white and blue. Cool, vast - not quite homely. The red offers a nice contrast, but she often does not want the structures to be a focal point. \n\nWhile the shape may be similar, what's evoked emotionally by a fall field of grain and hay is very different from a spring or summer ocean cliffside.",

She is a member of both the KKK and the Nazis, killed our family dog, and became vegan. I told her I am tired of cooking an extra vegan meal every day and she blew up at me and began screaming.   So I kicked her out. My entire family began blowing up my phone telling me I shouldn't have kicked her out. So, AITA?\n\n\n**Comments:** NTA, your daughter shouldn't act so entitled!

It\u2019s been done a million times and doesn\u2019t really have any other merit except for looking cool or freaky. Plus they photoshop the shit out of it afterwards",

Arts not *just* supposed to make you think \u201cwow that\u2019s cool good job!\u201d Good art is not about the artists skill or talent. It\u2019s about what the viewer feel and think when exposed to it. Hyper realistic pencil drawings or spray can speed space landscapes are some of the worst offenders.\n\n\nPreemptive edit/disclosure: there are many hyper realistic artists that create profound and meaningful art. One of my favorite artists of all times is Chuck Close. If you like that stuff check him out! His story alone is one of the more potent 20th century artists biographies.",

When you keep one of your eyes closed, the rods (or cones) rest and they \"reset\", while other eye's cones (or rods) are not and red cone cells get saturated, loosing sensitivity for a moment.\n\nThere is a trick that evolves using a strong light source (like a phone flashlight) and holding it close to the eye while closed. The longer you keep it, the longer the effect lasts. I tried this once, for the science of course, and it really did work for a hot minute. Made me slightly colorblind in the one eye",

Luxembourgisch has influences from Dutch, Swiss-German doesn\u2019t (at least not how I speak it and hear it spoken)\n\nThat description of the language is a bit inaccurate though. It's essentially a Moselle-Franconian dialect of German that has had a significant vocabulary influence from French, and tbh for most of the French loan words, there is a German equivalent. Its no more or less similar to Dutch than any other German dialect from the Southern Eifel and Moselle regions. If anything I would argue that its more similar to Hochdeutsch than Swiss German is. \n\nLuxembourgish being seen as a distinct language instead of a dialect is due to cultural/historical rather than linguistic factors, such as the two world wars. It only became recognised as a national language in 1984.",

However lately I've come to appreciate the language when spoken in a more articulate way and with a more comprehensive vocabulary by actual Luxembourgish people. Still I wouldn't call it a nice sounding language (neither would I call other germanic languages that; I even prefer Luxembourgish to German since it's less rigid, it flows better, more similarly to French I'd guess), but at least it has its own particularity and keeps up a sense of national identity.",

I love Brazil, Been to Sao paulo, Rio, Manaus,Belem,Brasilia,Recife,Salvador, super nice people and great food, especially arroz com feij\u00e3o preto. Portugal is like my second home, been there 20+ times and love it very much. Compared to these places Luxembourg kind of sucks",

There is a song in here that call Rio de Janeiro a \"purgatory of beauty and chaos\" and that is a very precise definition. We have a very nice weather, nice people and good food. But the crime rate is very high and job opportunities are awfull. \n\nI don't see myself abondoning brazil forever but I would like to know how it is to live somewhere else. \n\nNice to know that you have visited so much of Brazil. If you ever come back to Brazil you should visit Bonito or len\u00e7\u00f3is maranhenses. Both those places are amazingly beautiful.",

This is in the context of the original post where the OP, or original poster, was joking about what they normally hear when they say they're from Luxembourg. They were joking about how most people, due to Luxembourg relatively small size and lack of global inpact, generally dont know where where Luxembourg is or what Language they speak. Generally getting mistaken for a microstate like Monaco. My joke was in the form of advice, how if they didn't want to be unknown they should instead change to be from a \"real country\" instead. This is obviously outlandish advice because obviously Luxembourg is a real country. The outlandish nature of this advice makes it humorous.",

I am doing this for comedic effect. As you can see I am listing criteria I believe would disqualify a country from being a \"real country\". This criteria though are assorted random facts about Luxembourg. From its size to population as well as its climate. The point is for the list to be entirely arbitrary and outlandish.",

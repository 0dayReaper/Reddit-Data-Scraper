You are able to make lots of noise without immediately having the police knocking at your door because there is enough distance between you and your neighbors. We had a lot of parties and blasted music until the early hours of the morning and not once did we have a complaint. You can also run around on your grass and do American things like throw a baseball to your uncoordinated son who you secretly despise.\n\nYou can have things like a billiards table in your basement, along with an entire furnished guest room and storage area. Large kitchens with huge refrigerators and walk in pantries, and then a second fridge in the garage just for drinks. Then the separate freezer in the garage for deep freezing meats and dead bodies and such.\n\nThe cons of these houses is that they are made out of toothpicks and require tons of maintenance (painting the wood siding, cheap windows, roofing that requires patching, plumbing issues, etc). They are not very energy efficient (and large), and you have to run heat or air conditioning constantly depending on the seasons. The land requires a lot of maintenance as well if you want it to look nice, and generally there are no sidewalks in the neighborhood because there is nothing within walking distance anyway.\n\nIn Germany the houses made of stone will be standing for 200 years or more with minimal maintenance required (other than the mold that seems to haunt German home owners). The gardens are generally small, but there are also a lot of parks or \"Spielplaetze\" where kids and dogs and run around being annoying af (as long as its not Ruhezeit!) so its not much of an issue. The noise thing is a pain though, and if your neighbors hear you (and they will) after 10PM you can expect a 21 year old Polizist/in to knock on your door and politely ask you to stfu.",

For the most part it's on a teacher basis. Meaning, if they want to enforce it or not. Some classes may be fine and they dont abuse it, so teacher will let them go when needed. \n\nWhen I was in middle school, they printed up a set amount of passes(per semester) on a peice of paper. You had to fill out date/time and teacher would sign it. And if you lost it, you couldn't go during class. And you couldn't make a copy bc of some saftey measure they did, but I cant remember what it was. \n\nIt didnt last long. I when to school in like a upper lower class area, at least 40% of the kids grew up in bad areas, and were just heathens(myself included, embarrassingly). A lot of kids, just did what they wanted. \n\nPersonally though, it was kind of a bs system. I cant remember how many passes it was, but it wasnt enough. It's not like we were abused in anyway, more like we were the abusers. But it kinda seems inhumane to tell someone they can only go to the bathroom 4 or 5 times in a 75 day period. I understand what they were trying to do, but in opinion, that wasn't the right solution.",

My boss is a nice lady but works 14-16 hour shifts routinely, always complaining that her husband is not happy with her working so much. How that kind of life can be even remotely satisfying is beyond me. I've made it my goal in the next year to find a different industry, its tough because my position pays well but I'm willing to take a damn pay cut just so I don't end up like my boss. Fuck retail don't get stuck, if there is any young people here not sure what to do in life do not settle for retail management because you will regret it.",

He really thought he was the Wolf of Wall Street or whatever for bossing around a bunch of teenagers at Coles. Guy would have been in his late 20s and had worked at the store all his working life I believe.\n\nIt's only when I look back now, now that I'm settled into a career of my own, and think how pathetic he really was.",

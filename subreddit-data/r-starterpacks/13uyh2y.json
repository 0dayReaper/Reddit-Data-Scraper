I think it comes down to how it tries to be more interesting with the season structure, the different stories, the focus on different characters, I mean, I don't think Ramy is about anything besides Ramy. Same with Master of None and even Louie. But Atlanta really could be an interesting enough show even if Donald Glover's character wasn't in it. And that kind of ability to tell those different stories (and even in season 3, when you realise Atlanta can survive without any of those characters for half a season) really makes it a much better show than fucking Dave or Ramy.",

The other shows, you know, Aziz Ansari IS Dev, Ramy I'm assuming IS Ramy, Lil Dicky IS Dave, I mean, come on. But Barry of course is not Bill Hader and it's not just supposed to be, damn, I'm a comedian in this big city, this is my fucking life!

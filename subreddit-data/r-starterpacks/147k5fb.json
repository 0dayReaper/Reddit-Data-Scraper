I know Nashville is the classic bachelorette location, but I didn\u2019t realize Savannah was so popular. \n\nThe whole thing is weird to me. I understand the concept. Get your friends together and have a fun weekend. But bachelorette parties seem to be so over the top. My girlfriend had to spend so much money on this one she just went to. She had to buy a dress, because she didn\u2019t have one to wear out in the color that was the \u201ctheme.\u201d Also had to buy pajamas in the same color. And of course she had to drive all the way to Savannah. Then all the expensive nights out on the town. And she *had* to go, otherwise the bachelorette would have been really shitty with her about it.\n\nI would just never expect my friends to spend that much money for a fucking party. My bachelor party would be something like, \u201chey, dude. We\u2019re gonna go to X location for this weekend. Feel free to join. You live way far away, so if you can\u2019t swing it, no worries. We\u2019ll just hang out, play some golf, and get shwastey at night. Wear whatever the fuck you want. I don\u2019t care.\u201d",

None of my friends have subjected me to this (a blessing of growing up in church and friends marrying young/still indoctrinated), but I wouldn't do this for my own bachelorette party. I think the whole concept of bachelor/bachelorette parties is gross. \n\nLast night of freedom? Really? That's how you see marriage going in? Also, I'm assuming you've been dating for some time, so haven't been \"free\" for that time. I'm all for getting friends together for a nice dinner out, spa day, wine tasting, or something like that, but \"traditional\" bachelor/bachelorette parties are a \"no\" for me.",

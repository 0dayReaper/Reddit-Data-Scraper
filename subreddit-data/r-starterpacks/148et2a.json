But in the end the cons outnumber the pros by a little bit. Yeah I stretched this way too far but whatever lol.",

It's not like they are long enough to just have it play in the background while doing something else, but it's also kind of pointless, because you could just go read it yourself, without the annoying computer generated voice.\n\nAlso, I feel like these videos are basically 0 effort. The people creating them don't contribute anything of value at all.",

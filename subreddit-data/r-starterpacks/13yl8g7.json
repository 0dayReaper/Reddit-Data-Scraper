If you\u2019re in the country.. no way. \n\nBut low profile tires often look cool, and a car is an extension of someone\u2019s style for a lot of people.  Overly thick tires in the country also look good, but at the expense of MPG. For city folks it\u2019s all about style when they opt for low profile, and you lose ride comfort *slightly* and you have to swap the tires more often, but generally it\u2019s not a big hinderance.",

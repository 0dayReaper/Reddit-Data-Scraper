If there\u2019s a way to beat a popular game within a few minutes then people are naturally interested in how that\u2019s done.\n\nThat being said, if a glitch takes away too much of the joy from the game the community can create a separate category where that glitch is prohibited. The fastest category which allows all glitches is often not the most popular one to play and watch. The best speed runs strikes a balance between having cool tricks while keeping a good part of the game.",

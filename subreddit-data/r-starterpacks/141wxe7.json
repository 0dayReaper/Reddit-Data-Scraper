Basically just a bunch of adults who knew how to take their fucking shoes off. It was a breeze.\n\nNow I seem to get in line with every single parent who has 580 teenagers and 1027 elderly people with walkers with them, none of whom know how to read.\n\nBoarding and deboarding is a nightmare where every person's most selfish instincts come out because the airlines are terrible.\n\nEvery year it seems like flying can't possibly get worse... And then it does. It should be illegal for most people to carry on carry-ons.",

Instead of it being a 3 hour flight we were stuck in the air for like 5 hours for some reason, then they decided to land in Atlantic City Airport and all of us passengers thought we would get back on the plane, we were wrong. We were stuck in Atlantic City Airport for over 4 hours. Spirit left us and a lot of passengers were mad, a group of passengers went to the Spirit desk in the airport and were yelling at the staff. We were given a free charter bus ride to compensate whatever happened. Still had a nice ending for the Summer trip before I started my first year in high school.",

Not sure how it is elsewhere, but over here we have credit cards for *everything*, as a lot of companies have \"loyalty\" credit cards that offer extra incentive for them specifically when you spend money. I use a United Airlines card, thus I earn points/miles when I spend. I couldn't really dream of flying first class normally, but my last trip I would periodically check flights I was interested in and I ended up finding an insane deal flying first class one way. Was delightful.\n\nWith airline miles, they also offer deals on purchasing miles - with the deals sometimes being buy x amount of miles and you get the same amount as a bonus (I'm awful at maths and am unsure how to type that out simpler). So on top of finding a deal, I had previously bought (example numbers, not exact) 5,000 miles and gotten an additional bonus 5,000.",

I am talking her fingers were a blur as she began bitching him out to the group. I caught things like \"He should know better. He is cheap. We should be 1st class. Not treating me right.\"\n\nThen the responses came back. Many of her friends immediately jumped on the bandwagon. Telling her \"deserve better.\" \"Not a man.\" \"Tear him apart.\" \"Not worth it\"\n\nTHEN! She opened a different Text Message - this with the name \"Daddy\"! She texts things like \"sending surprise later\" \"he is not man enough like you.\"  And some more lewd comments.\n\nThe Boyfriend texts back about cost, money, and hoe it was apparently last minute which sends her into a barrage of texts.\n\nThis triple back n forth lasted the whole flight but around this point she shifted in her seat and I could not see the screen. So I watched Bodies Bodies Bodies instead",

As soon as one stopped crying, the other one started crying harder.\n\nThe very large 2-year-old that I'm guessing was actually a 3 or 4-year-old had managed to perfect the extremely high pitch scream that says \" AIR RAID SIREN LEVEL EMERGENCY\" to adults.\n\nThe parents each had several drinks. And made no real effort to soothe either child, and as soon as the older child started to settle, the father antagonized him a bit because _he_ said he was a nervous flyer. I also overheard the parents saying they already had them nap because they knew they wouldn't be able to sleep on the plane.\n\nThey cried the **entire time.**",

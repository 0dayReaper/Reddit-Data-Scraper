Went to one for 4 years in a row as a kid. The last time I went to one we got to meet a dog that was in the search and rescue during 9/11.",

My German great grandparents were farmers who learned how to make Mexican food from their Mexican neighbors in California during the great depression. Ground beef was inexpensive and diced potatoes were usually added to the mix as a filler. Cabbage was commonly used as a filling because it kept well and could be bought for cheap (my grandmother remembers picking up the ones that would fall off the trucks that went around the corner near her childhood house). These ingredients were incorporated into traditional Mexican dishes out of necessity. While times did get better, my family has continued to use these recipes that were shared by my great grandparent\u2019s neighbors.",

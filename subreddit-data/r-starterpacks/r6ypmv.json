She said she was trying her best. I'm mad but now it's a fine and I don't know what their situation is financially. I know the complex raised my rent significantly. Maybe I'm just justifying it but I've been mad as hell and I just ended up feeling like a villain. It seems to me that the villains in children's stories feel justified. I don't think they'll stop without legal action or animal control because they've been talked to by my wife and warned by the complex a few times. I don't want a feud or some lame shit.",

It smelled like cat piss and burnt plastic frequently, there were stray crystals littering the carpet, let alone dealing with the tweaker himself. The family wouldn't kick him out, so we buried them in complaints and fines. \n\nI don't feel bad. \n\nThis is YOUR space, these people are telling you that you will keep suffering because of their actions. The threat to take away the dog should be a ONE TIME threat and then the next time it happens, made good upon. It's not a threat, if the kid knows you won't follow through. \n\nIt's not your problem. It's theirs. And that should mean fines if it keeps happening.",

Apologies in advance :)\n\n\n* Be sure to get your repeat *before* you run out - going cold turkey is *rough* and you may need to go through the difficult period of first going on them again. \n\n\n* If you can afford it, keep a spare box as a reserve and cycle through them both, getting your repeats as you go. Better safe than sorry. \n\n\n* Once your levels... Level out, you'll feel a lot better - I started to get really good sleep once I started, and I could think clearly for the first time in *years*.\n\n\n* Finally, once they're working it'll feel like you don't need them anymore - don't fall for that... Work with your doctor if you want to come off them. \n\n\nAll the best :D",

From when I was a kid, I was warned of the danger of sticking anything in my ears. \"Nothing smaller than your elbow in your ear!\", my grandma would say. I didn't really get that one.\n\nBut whatever, right? Those are just old-people concerns and I'm a smart young person, in control of my own destiny. Why should I listen? These old people were probably just repeating an antiquated and unscientific cautionary tale told to them by *their* parents without ever questioning it. I'll be careful! I'll know when it's too far! I'm not going to just stab it in there! What could be the harm?\n\nSo I started cleaning my ears with q-tips. One day I went a bit too far. Didn't feel like much at the time. Six years later and I still don't hear very well from my left ear and it makes an uncomfortable popping noise/sensation every time I hear anything much louder than a whisper. It's super annoying.\n\nDon't do it, kids. Listen to your parents.",

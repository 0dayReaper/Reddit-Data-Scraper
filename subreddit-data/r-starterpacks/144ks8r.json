When I finally moved to Denver, I found a place that cut my hair and bangs the way I liked, which was sort of a Betty Page/Vampirella style at the time. My mom came to visit and wanted to see my stylist to get the same cut. I was mortified, but he took one look at her, flatly proclaimed, \"I'm not going to do that\", and gave her a cut that she loved. People either loved or hated the way I cut my bangs, but I was so happy to find a place that buzzed the sides and did them the way I'd always dreamed of.",

She charges me 5x what I was used to paying, but I don\u2019t care, she can charge any amount she likes. \n\nIt isn\u2019t some super complicated cut, I just want them to shave and square out the sides. I had a pixie cut for 23 years because it didn\u2019t matter what pictures I showed to any hairdresser for what I wanted vs what I didn\u2019t. They just cut what they wanted regardless of my input lol. And it still took fighting them constantly to get the pixie cut, every time they cut it shorter than a bob, they would position the scissors over my hair, nearly trembling, and yell \u201care you really really sure you want it shorter\u201d and if I said yes, they would cut it like one mm shorter lol. Imagine having to fight to get each millimeter cut off your hair, it\u2019s ridiculous. When I was 16, and found a barber who would cut it nearly correctly, my mom found out who he was and yelled at him so he refused to cut my hair that way from then on. \n\nTbh I\u2019m kinda nervous about moving overseas soon because I need to go through this all over again, but it\u2019s Amsterdam so I assume it will be much better.",

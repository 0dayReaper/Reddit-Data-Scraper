Reason being is Jordan wouldn't let you leave the table until he won his money back; or even demand you play again the next day until he won it back. One of the reasons Jordan was such a prolific NBA player was competitiveness, and it is well documented that this was just a general trait and not something relegated to the basketball court.",

The pedophile rings are real, but they get looked at skeptically because of the nutjobs.",

For some reason, Mickey is seen as a little more upscale.  Why is a mystery.  People who wear them out do so because it's not worth the effort to change in and out of real pants for a 20 minute Walmart run.  Exhaustion or depression can play a role, but sometimes it's just that everyone else around you does it so it's normal.",

Honestly, it's more walkable than my downtown apartment was with how car centric the urban hubs are.\n\nBut I also get a lot more amenities than the country.  Frankly, I feel guilty because it's way more space than I need right now but I'm starting a family and didn't want to buy a starter home wed outgrow in a couple years.",

Neighbors are all super nice (about half are older and had kids who are about my age and the other half are people my age starting families). Very close with the neighbors on one side, the others keep to themselves, but are incredibly nice. Good friends with a few houses up the street. People outside exercising, walking their dogs all day, a bunch of kids playing all the time. Neighbors leave their garages wide open at night kids leave their bikes on the front lawn and they don\u2019t get stolen. I got a huge garden, a shit ton of firewood, back patio where all my friends come over and still so much space. Our \u201cdowntown\u201d area is 10 mins away and there are a ton of bars and restaurants too. Friends who lived in the city told me that it was hard for them to get groceries at the start of the pandemic and our major city was turned upside down during the protests - it was business as usual up here.",

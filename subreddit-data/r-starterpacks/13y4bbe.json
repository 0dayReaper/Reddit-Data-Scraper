Two good films that are technically rom-coms I\u2019ve watched:\n\nForrest Gump and Heartstopper\n\nThe thing is, they have other aspects that make them not intolerable. One of the main themes in both is resiliency and getting through tough times. They also are, in my opinion, genuinely funny and not just \u201cha ha me stupid 4 girl/guy\u201d.",

                                    "comment": "Hi! On mobile, forgive formatting. I had severe dental trauma as a child and didn\u2019t go at all in my 20\u2019s. \n\n\nA few years ago I finally decided to bite the bullet and just go. I come from a family of really bad teeth and was having a lot of tooth pain - so I knew things were going to be bad. \n\nAt my first appointment, I explained my fear of the dentist through a massive crying/anxiety attack (completely out of my character) so they made sure to be incredibly gentle. I was set up with headphones, Netflix, a blanket and laughing gas/nitrous - just for a basic exam and cleaning. I still cried through the appointment, but made it through. \n\nI think I had about $11k worth of procedures that needed to be done, and over the last couple years I\u2019ve been getting them done. For the bigger appointments (crowns, root canals) the doc prescribed a strong anti-anxiety medication that I take before the appointment. This is on top of the nitrous oxide, so I really am quite high. It\u2019s great, and almost kind of fun. \n\nI always watch The Cosmos or Planet Earth during the procedures - one time I watched a Doors documentary and the music was super cool - and completely zone out. \n\nThe interesting thing is going to the dentist now is a completely different experience then it was just a couple of years ago. I no longer get anxiety attacks and no longer cry uncontrollably in the chair! I associate it now with getting high and learning about planets. \n\nEach appointment has gotten better and better, I even had a cleaning two months ago with no nitrous and a crown with no meds! So I think I\u2019m finally getting over my paralyzing fear of the dentist. \n\nAnyways, I know EXACTLY how you feel - but you can do this! Find a good, patient dentist that will take care of you and I promise it will be worth it. \n\nGood luck!",

Because generally people who use waterpiks are people who don't like or have an aversion to flossing. So by telling people their waterpik is a waste of time all you're doing is making them do neither.\n\nAlso, I have found this information online, but who knows how reliable the stats are:\n&gt;Clinical studies of the Waterpik have found that the water flosser is 51% more effective for reducing gingivitis, twice as effective at reducing gingival bleeding, and 29% more effective at removing plaque. The Waterpik can give you healthier teeth and gums when being used for just a minute per day.\n\n&gt;As well as reaching areas of your mouth that your toothbrush cannot get to, you can also use it to reach areas that dental floss can not get to, such as periodontal pockets or pockets around wisdom teeth.\n\nStill, I would think it's better for people to be using waterpiks than nothing at all..",

The truth is the waterpik can remove a piece of chicken muscle fiber between your teeth, but that is not what is causing decay.  The decay is a layer of \u201cgunk\u201d that can only be scraped off with abrasion.  Just use floss, is it that hard to do?  If not that\u2019s fine, in a way we rely on people not flossing for our livelihood!",

They word the question like this \"would you recommend brushing your teeth with Colgate or not brushing your teeth at all?\" And 10 out of 10 dentists always say \"I'd recommend brushing with Colgate.\" But as a consumer, you might think \"That's too much. Are they really claiming that 100% of dentists recommend using Colgate? Mine doesn't. I use Crest and she actually recommended Sensodyne when I said I have sensitive teeth, and I don't think she's a bad dentist. I don't trust Colgate.\" But if you see 9 out of 10, you think that there's some dentists who may disagree but lots of dentists think Colgate is great. \n\nIt's like Amazon reviews. When you're reading a 5 star review you kind of have to wonder just how easy that person is to please, and how discerning they are. But a 4 star review that points out some small flaw that doesn't really matter is somehow more meaningful to you because you know they were actually thinking about the product and it also makes you think that they probably weren't paid to write the review.",

I understand this is just anecdotal experience but I mean I just use a normal manual toothbrush (I was instructed to buy soft bristle only) twice a day, mouthwash, and the waterpik once a day.  \n\nI have some sensitively due to lack of hygiene as a child but I\u2019m in my mid 20\u2019s now and have had near perfect visits for years now. My diet is definitely not great (but not terrible) so I definitely eat enough sugar to wreck my teeth if I wasn\u2019t caring for them. I mean that can\u2019t all be coincidence can it? I have been told that I brush really hard (hence the need for soft bristles) but I would think that would still leave plenty of buildup if I didn\u2019t use the waterpik?",

It's pretty remarkable.\n\nIf you pay a little extra money for the Optimal Plaque Control brush heads, which are basically more densely packed and stiffer, then it's true that you don't even have to floss anymore. they're strong enough to push all the crap right out from between your teeth. I know this because occasionally I'll take some floss to my teeth and I won't get any blood or gunk on it.\n\nNot a Phillips shill.

The ultimate people watching location because they seem to foster this very unique juxtaposed feeling of transience and hospitality all at the same time. \nIt's a really fascinating melting pot. Because of my fascination with them I actually really love the movie \"The Terminal\" which is absolute garbage as a movie but as a concept was really fun and different and it ended up as a sort of comforting nostalgic garbage movie. It's also based on a very interesting book about a real person who has lived in an airport for years, Sir Alfred Mehran or Mehran Karimi Nasseri who lived in the terminal of Charles de Gaulle airport for about 18 years. It's called \"The Terminal Man\" if you ever want to look it up.",

    "postText": "Hello fellow starterpack creators. Recently the mod team have been noticing an uptick in overused/beating a dead horse starterpack topics. The reason this rule is in place is because people do not want to see starterpacks done on the same 10 topics all week. \n\nFor example starterpacks like \n\n\"White guy with no personality\"\n\"Basic white girl\" \n\"Guy with maga flags on his truck\"\n\"Upstairs neighbor\"\n\"Generation z/y/z/ nostalgia\"\n\"Things I played/did/watched in 2000\" etc.\n\nWe want starterpacks to be fun and creative. People don't want to see \"Lift kit truck guy with beard guy bad\" starterpacks and nostalgia starterpacks 24/7.\n\n\nHope this is understandable for everyone and you have a great rest of your day.",

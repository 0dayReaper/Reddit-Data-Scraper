These recent changes are actually pretty good for moderators because reddit added new mod tools. The API change also hurts normal users because admins are not the only ones using bots.

And finally the changes that reddit have made all seem to lead to even bigger changes like removal of oldreddit or nsfw content restrictions. So I really don't get your point about it only affecting moderators",

            "comment": "Homeboy, you can literally just not play whatever big-bucks AAA title is coming out.\n\nAlso, COD, BF and Halo are just that, stale, same with stuff like Destiny, at least for me it's boringly realistic gritty/futuristic stuff I've seen a million times before and don't care for at all. Try something different, that isn't multiplayer/live-service, or geared at grade-schoolers, like Poppy Playtime or the literal worst game in the FNaF franchise.\n\nGames like Overwatch, Fortnite or Valorant are really better with friends. If you don't have anyone to play with and you don't particularly care much for that progression + reward motivator, the competitive side or the FOMO, avoid those games.\n\nMy advice? Try [itch.io](https://itch.io) and Gamejolt. You'll find a plethora of small, medium-sized and big games there, a lot of them free and full of soul due to being indie. If you want some real good horror, itch is THE place to go, just saying.\n\nAs for VC, it's always been like that, I'm gonna keep it real with you, kids have always been playing online games that perhaps shouldn't be. If it's not a kid, it'll be some grown ass man screaming slurs at you all the same, unless you find a chill match of whatever online game you're playing.  \nOr, alternatively... PLAY SINGLEPLAYER GAMES! Especially the indies, as THEY ARE ALSO FUN! Play A Hat In Time, Doki Doki Literature Club, Super Meat Boy, Celeste, Pizza Tower, Rain World, Don't Starve, Ape Out, Spelunky, 60 Seconds, fuckin Cupman, Castle Crashers, Guacamelee, Isaac, RPG Maker horror games, any Toby Fox game, and two less known gems, My Child Lebensborn if you wanna take care of an orphan, cry a lot, and revisit a dark period in history, and Chenso Club, for some simple fun.

I'm not trying to represent, I'm just speaking english as I've learned it over the majority of my life. Hell, it isn't even my first language, but I just kinda speak this way casually. I use terms from the english, I use terms from you americans, and I use them all interchangeably because it's still english at the end of the day, and I can speak it the way I desire to.  \nAt the same time I acknowledge where these terms come from and I do my best to use them correctly and in a manner that makes sense. Nothing I said there in my original post was even incorrect, gramatically.  \nAAVE isn't being cool either, no one has ever said that, it's just a vernacular and it's also considered \"regular\" english. Bit weird you seem to think it's some lower form of it when it simply isn't.\n\nAnd don't you see the irony in saying \"I don't think I'm a literal bigot\" followed by \"but\"? Like, your whole posts lately are filled with some weird anger over anyone that so much as dares to use AAVE, then you just start angrily ranting about the current generation, and then get confused when others confuse you for a middle-aged freak who probably has some issues with minorities, when you act **exactly like them**.  \nI can't even tell if you're angry over pale ass white people using it (understandable) or if you just have some weird, seemingly racist hate-boner for this vernacular of the english language. Regardless, you look very weird and you're accomplishing absolutely nothing. Just drop it, or start going about things differently. I absolutely would say that it's insulting to see something like, what, some Iowa-raised white boy on social media appropriating AAVE to seem hip, cool or to fit in, but, please understand that it's not the case all the time.\n\nDon't know what else to tell you really. Hope you chill out there.",

There have been too many fan horror games that copy fnaf in terms of asthetics and it\u2019s gameplay. So many games just involve you in a dark building and looking at some fuzzy cameras. The wave of analogue games recently is just a great example of this.",

Measurements and simulations show that, even though the Sun-like Alpha Centauri A and B are both far larger and brighter (in absolute terms) than Proxima Centauri (a mere red dwarf) is, they are still distant enough that, in Proxima B's night sky, they would \"only\" be as bright as the full moon is from Earth.\n\nIn *Avatar*, even with the scientific liberties they could have taken, they still made Pandora's parent gas giant only orbit Alpha Centauri A, rather than both A and B.",

My dad watches OAN for the \"content\" but he likes to compare it to a high school production because at first it seemed pretty low budget and the reporters don't look all that professional. Relatively recently (last month or two) it was found out that a journalist at OAN was actually on the Kremlin payroll, it's literally Russian propaganda lol. \n\nI haven't seen much OAN lately though... My dad used to watch it in the living room all the time but my parents came to an unsaid agreement that my mom won't watch MSNBC around him if he doesn't watch OAN around us. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

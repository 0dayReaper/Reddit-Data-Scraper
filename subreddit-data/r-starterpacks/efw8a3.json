On the other hand, ephebophilia, while still immoral and illegal in most civilized places, is not listed as a mental disorder in the DSM-5 because it relates to a viable reproductive strategy.\n\nIn other words, most species have evolved to prefer younger mates because age generally correlates with unsuccessful/riskier pregnancies. In the case of humans, however, we achieve sexual maturity faster than cognitive maturity. We are thus able to reproduce much earlier than we are able to grasp what that fully entails. This is why we have \"age of consent\" laws. And also why ephebophilia, while \"natural\", isn't moral and should definitely not be legal.",

The first century CE got it's math wrong, so technically our number of years past is one less than what we say. \n\n*Of course* the bigger reason for this is, the number 0 hadn't really made it to Rome at the time we were making these calendars, let alone been embraced across mathematical understanding. Today we think of years as a measure of time past, but at inception it was time reached. We transitioned into the first Year of Our Lord (Anno Domini, AD), we are in the 2019th year presently, going into the 2020th, with only 2018 complete years behind us.",

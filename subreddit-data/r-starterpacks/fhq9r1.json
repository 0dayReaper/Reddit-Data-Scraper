I looked up some average wages, and the highest average in the country is New York, where EMTs make $15.36/hr (again, avg), or about $32k/year. New York's minimum wage is $15/hr. \n\nHow the hell are there even more than a baker's dozen of EMTs in this country? As far as minimum wage jobs go, it's one of the highest stress ones I can think of. And unlike other min. wage jobs, it requires a bunch of certification? \n\nI genuinely don't understand the economics, here, but I'm super glad you all are willing to do the job.",

I figured it would garner some respect, some consideration, and some people who'd return the favour. I even once went 3 consecutive weeks without a day off, all because I wanted to be helpful to my coworkers and managers.\n\nInstead, it got me taken advantage of. They always went to me when they needed someone to work because they knew I wouldn't say no. But nobody would ever take my shifts when I couldn't make it, and they would never let me call in sick. So I started only going in when I was scheduled and all of a sudden I'm a terrible worker because I started saying no. Meanwhile, the lazy employees who always called in sick or got their shifts covered didn't get any punishment or reprimands.\n\nI learned a couple of lessons then. Most managers don't give a fuck about you, so don't let them - or your coworkers - take advantage of your kindness. Also, they'll always expect your standard. If you give 110%, then they'll bitch at you when you only give 100%. Thirdly, employers love young and naive employees, because they don't stand up for themselves.",

He skimmed all of my paychecks. I was promised 50k a year and received less than MO state minimum wage. The White castles here pay 11/hour.\n\n2nd one hired me and then fired me 5 days later. He refused to give me a reason why, and even refused to admit it was his desicion. \n\nLast one was a company that does security/fire alarm, and are a more local company. They were in the middle of a lawsuit, most of the techs had no idea what they were doing, and not a single person in the company was certified. \n\nFuck a family, I wanna work as a cog in a huge multinational company where everyone is professional and everything works like it should.",

I was getting my degree in psychology and considered the marketing/business angle. I go for the initial interview and express that I am interested in market research. Things seem to go well\nI go in for a second interview and they go to take me to the coffee stand outside the building. It was rainy and there was nowhere dry to sit, so the interviewer says, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the Denny\u2019s down the road.\u201d No big deal. But I get in his little sedan and I\u2019m literally sitting on trash and the floor of the car is full of water bottles. \nAnyway, this guy describes what this company does. Literally this company just sells baseball tickets. Door to door to businesses. There was nothing about marketing involved. \nPretty much this business was a scam. I also never got a call back and their website was oddly gone soon after.",

Seriously, I don\u2019t even talk to my own squadron and I live in the same barracks.\n\n2.) Sometimes criminals will do things so fast, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re reaching for and you have no choice but to either deploy your baton (less than lethal,) a taser (less than lethal,) or if you can absolutely justify it, your gun. At the end of the day, it\u2019s our job to protect US national critical infrastructure, US/NATO personnel, and all else in the 8 points.\n\n3.) If we shoot someone, we will be put under investigation and get our gun taken from us, appear in court, mandatory mental health/off days, all that good stuff. It\u2019s a waiting game to see if the shooting was justified or not, and it will be argued heavily in both ways. Sometimes, it\u2019s easier to not shoot someone, even if they can be very dangerous to others. No one wants to go through the headaches of investigations.\n\n4.) Our suspect\u2019s well being is in our hands. If they pretend to trip and fall and they get hurt, guess who gets in trouble. If the cuffs are too tight and they get hurt, guess who gets in trouble. If they are being stubborn and we even bruise them, guess who gets in trouble.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to retain. I love my job, but you\u2019re constantly walking on very thin egg shells. One mess up can affect your life for a very long time.\n\nWith all of this said, I don\u2019t know how civilian law enforcement works. They get a union, we don\u2019t. But we free lawyers (typically Major rank.) I don\u2019t think civilian cops do, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen civilian cops do some wild stuff on the body camera videos. No way we would be able to get away with any of that without a dishonorable discharge, any administrative punishment, or prison.",

Then somehow the entire sherrif's department AND police (inclusing a dog for some reason) get involved in this tiny flat builing, where she eventually rushes them, stabs one sherrif, and all of them unload like a 100 rounds into her.\n\nIf only the cop had maybe left her alone, and just reported her as being potentially dangerous, nobody had to even be hurt that day at all. Also, why the fuck do you need 12 guys, a dog and shotguns to defeat one tiny single lady with a knife\n\nAmerican cops are such cowards OMG",

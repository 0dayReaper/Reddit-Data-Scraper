These people who I thought were unwatchable before suddenly became hilarious. \n\nTrevor Noah definitely did adopt the jump cut which I think works really well for his style.\n\nJohn Oliver had some growing pains. I think his first couple of episodes sans audience were a bit cringe. He would tell a joke and without the laughter pause it just felt... strange. Could have also just been me anticipating a laugh that made it feel weird, but it does feel like the writing and delivery has been fine tuned to adjust for the lack of laughter, but the style hasn't seemed to change much.\n\nColbert, who I always thought came off as pompous and a bit too into himself when he started Late Show, has really started to lean in to the bad jokes and doesn't seem to take himself as seriously as before. Pausing for an uncomfortable amount of time after delivery to emphasize the awkwardness of it all. His wife sitting two feet away and lightly chuckling amplifies it all when she's around. I went from never smiling at a single joke, to audibly laughing at the majority. He's had the best transition imo.\n\nHaven't watched much of Seth, but his interview with John Mulaney (There is like three separate videos on Youtube) is genuinely hilarious. Probably has more to do with Mulaney than Seth honestly.\n\nKimmel still manages to be completely unlikeable however. Probably because his format has not changed at all as he still has an audience (Guessing it's just staff?).",

[U/Thybro](https://old.reddit.com/user/Thybro) was able to perfectly summarize my thoughts and put them into words much better than I ever could. Thank you, U/Thybro\n\n&gt; Yes they did and it\u2019s awful but the guy giving out his experience is not at fault for it. His experience is also relevant to a good chunk if not the majority of the people in this website.\n&gt; \n&gt; So why the need to sour the discussion more than it already is. You think he is not aware of the rising unemployment? You think he doesn\u2019t know that almost 300k people died in the US alone? But maybe for once he\u2019d like to discuss his state of mind regardless of how tiny his problems may be in the grand scale of things.",

There wasn't this politization of the virus, the endless commercials being about COVID, every single person talking about COVID and nothing but, nobody out on the streets, it really made you feel like the entire world was going through it together. Absolutely, some had it worse than others (losing their job, hours cut, got COVID very early on when it was *very* unknown what would happen to you), but for the most part, it felt like everyone was experiencing the same thing, together. I fully recognize that I am coming from a place of privilege, but something about those first few weeks does cause a sense of nostalgia, in comparison to the shit show 2020 turned out to be very soon after that.",

We have have stayed bubbled so my in laws can help with the kids, if we sent the kids to daycare they would never get to see their grandparents.

You quickly reach into your pocket to grab your keys  and the frayed metal wire pokes you underneath your pointer fingernail . As you scream in pain, you forgot that  those locking mechanisms had loosened up over time. The ring unlocks by itself when you are standing over a grate next to your car. As you go to unlock the car, all the keys all slide off and fall into the grate, along with what\u2019s left of your sanity. A one eyed monkey hoots in the distance.",

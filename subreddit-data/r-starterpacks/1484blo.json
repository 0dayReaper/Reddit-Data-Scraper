And he grunts like he's a strongman, and after every set he flexes in the mirror for like 5 minutes while taking pictures of himself.\n\nAnd like.. dudes so skinny you can't even notice a pump. And he has equally broccoli looking friends sometimes, and i overheard them talking... Little dude is on a cut, while trying to gain muscle, and was telling them about his sick new pre workout which was gonna explode his gains and \"t levels\". And not to mention, there isn't anything for him to actually cut. He's the posterboy of skin and bones.\n\nDude needs some damn guidance.",

Tons and tons of discussion about how awful the choosing beggar is when it\u2019s very clearly the most formulaic, fabricated trash you can post.

It\u2019s like watching a deliberate exercise in insanity, which is why I\u2019m subscribed to watch. \ud83d\ude0e",

His posts always had the exact same naming convention. [Religious person] [says something bad] on [religious sub], gets upvotes and supported by fellow [religious dominations]. And if more than four comments were said in his post defending said religion/pointing out people disagreeing in the thread/saying anything even remotely positive about religion he\u2019d delete it than repost it later claiming that it got brigaded by religious subs. He once did it **six times** in a single day. Within a week half the sub hated him, and after about three I think the mods banned him for the spamming.",

At the same time though, the constant bashing of The Last Jedi at every turn online and even IRL just fills me with dread when someone brings up Star Wars. Love the property, hate the fans.",

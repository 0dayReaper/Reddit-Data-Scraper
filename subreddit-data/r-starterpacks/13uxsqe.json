If you add in anime/VGM then it's literally my friend Douglas.\nI often wonder if that guy has any life plans other than hanging around in his parents' house getting free games and free microtransactions, and genuinely asking why our other friend won't hand over their money to Sony so they can play games online on their PS4 with us.\n\nIt's a lack of self-awareness, and of the world around him that simply astounds me. But hey at least he's not a bigot.",

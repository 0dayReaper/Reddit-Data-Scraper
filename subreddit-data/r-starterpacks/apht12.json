They had my car 3 times for a total of a month and a half because i hit a curb going 40 and gas was leaking but they couldnt figure out why. They even lied to me and said they fixed it becaues it would only smell like gas if i filled the tank. I got the car back and it was almost empty, as soon as i filled it i could smell gas.\n\nI ended up taking it to the dealership and they called me an hour later saying the fuel pump was leaking, service king never said one word about the fuel pump and never even checked it because its under the backseat and they never took my carseat out. \n\nSo I posted a scathing review detailing their incompetence and how i was up shit creek without a paddle because they ran out my rental coverage on my insurance and i was having to use PTO to get my car worked on. a half hour later someone from service king called and gave me a rental for the remainder of the repair.\n\nHowever i left the review up and just updated it. The incompetence of the local shop was not washed away by corps. actions and people need to now how incompetent they are.\n\nprotip: If insurance is paying for repair work GO TO THE DEALERSHIP, if your paying out of pocket but can afford it GO TO THE DEALERSHIP!",

So what JD Power actually does is survey people who have bought a product and collects their feedback. Marketing department love this kind of info. This info is then sold to companies like Chevy and comes with 'awards' if you place highest in a survey category. \n\nThis begs the question of how useful such data really is. Sure it may be useful to know that people don't all hate a product, but lets take this example they use in the commercials, more Chevy owners rates their Chevy as having the highest quality for the first 6 months. So two things jump out right away here. First, what the hell happens after 6 months? (does the car just fall apart?)\n\nAnd the second issue is this isn't comparative. What do Chevy owners know about the quality of the Toyota for instance? Perhaps BMW owners have a really high standard of 'quality' that BMW may slightly fail to meet. But does that mean a BMW that fails to meet that high standard then has an over all 'lower quality' that a Chevy Malibu who's owners may have a much 'lower standard' of quality? \n\nYou can see that the JD Power info has some value for a companies marketing department to know, but not enough for a consumer to use it to actually compare vehicles to buy. So for the end consumer it really ends up practically being bullshit. ",

Like you gotta have something seriously wrong in the head that these are the first \u201croasts\u201d that come to your head after seeing one picture. It\u2019s not even a fucking roast. The only people laughing at this would be his incel buddies.\n\n\u201cA quick glance is enough to tell me:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060That you blame your parents and the system for your lack of joy, and channel all these emotions into some moronic revolt that ultimately only results in people caring less for you, and being unnoticed by most.\n\u2022\t\u2060You treat men like they\u2019re the living symbol of the father you never really had, and probably not because he wasn\u2019t there, you just blame him because he doesn\u2019t \u00abget\u00bb you. Leading you to become pretty much a cumslut that guys want to fix, but inevitably become tired off within a few weeks.\n\u2022\t\u2060you\u2019re a snowflake in every single way, that should have been spanked by daddy 15 years ago, but they were morons who believed in the new parenting trends and fucked up by sending you in therapy instead. Which, as evidenced by the picture, obviously didn\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m here to tell you that you\u2019re an insignificant speck of dust that no one gives a fuck about. You probably even thought I\u2019d end this on a lighter note, but I won\u2019t. Imo, you\u2019re the manifestation of everything people in their 40-50s did wrong when it comes to parenting, and we both know that me and my peers will have to bear the burden of paying for your social welfare so you can continue to \u00abexpress yourself\u00bb well into your 60s. The only hope both of us have is that some future boytoy will choke you abit too hard whilst you\u2019re both high on bathsalts.\u201d",

Most people probably hand you things because they like looking at you. But that's made you vapid, shallow, and unable to perform in any way that adds true value in the world.\nYour relationships are superficial. Your romance life always has the shadow of doubt. Does he love you... or how you look? If you were disfigured, would anyone give you a second glance based on personality?\nThat nagging feeling will keep you looking for validation. It keeps you in the gym. It makes you post photos online looking for praise or positive attention. It keeps you going back for a nip here and tuck there. Before long you'll look like Donatella Versace with the personality of one of her handbags.\nYou'll shift from being the center of attention to being part of a gaggle of women who make rude comments about younger girls because you feel jealous and rude comments about men who no longer pay attention to you.\nYou'd be better served working on being a better person than hunting for attention on Reddit, but you'll likely die young and your grave will be about as shallow as your personality.\u201d\n\nHoly shit that was rough",

I would talk music with this cool substitute teacher that would pop in every once in while. That guy was cool as hell. He would tell me and some buddies stories about the 70's and 80's and all the cool bands he got to see and after learning that I liked [War Pigs](https://youtu.be/PrZFscfJxXc) he burned the entire Sabbath discography on a bunch of CD's for me (I remember him being a die-hard fan). I never saw that guy again -- but thanks to him Black Sabbath is one of my favorite bands of all time and my mom believed I worshipped the devil for a number of years. Good times.",

Guy always asked how I was doing and got really upset when the school kept trying to send me home because my parents were late on tuition, he said that if I was already at school they might as well let me stay the rest of the day. Unfortunately he killed himself a few years ago I don\u2019t think he was even 40 years old.\n\nHe really cared about the students, I remember one time a kid was getting bullied in the hallway and I just hear this teacher shout at the top of his lungs \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING?\u201d and everything went silent. He went and disciplined the bully and then went back to the victim and asks in this very matter-of-fact way \u201care you ok\u201d and I just thought to myself \u201cwow what a guy\u201d",

His ex-wife accused him of rape and even though he was not convicted of anything the school still let him go. He really loved teaching a lot so getting fired must have been a massive blow to him. It was really sad because he even had a fianc\u00e9 that he was supposed to get married to that same year. \n\nHe is not someone who I ever thought would commit suicide because he was such a strong guy mentally really thick skin and ex-military so it was very very shocking when I found out. He was always the teacher who would be calm at all times and never lash out at students and stuff even the bad ones he always tried to see things clearly before reacting to them.",

They probably kept him going longer than his brain would have normally let him.\n\nAs an old (by reddit standards) academic, I know a lot of these guys. A few of them are close friends of mine and I worry about them. Their lives are tough. They have all the problems that their teenage students have compounded by divorce, health, insurance, student debt, isolation, rent/mortgage, child support, parents' failing health, and/or general loneliness. \n\nIt's hard being an adult and even harder being a teacher but the high school teachers I know take comfort in their students. They truly love and respect them. They never expect you to love/respect them back. With misty eyes, they talk about it over beers with their buddies though.\n\n*edit: to make things more clear.",

If you give them an inch they will take a mile. Everything in your class has to be meticulously on-point in order to get anything done.\n\nThat being said, \"cool teachers\" don't come to be because they didn't have any friends in school, in fact it's mostly the opposite. A young teacher with no support structure outside the classroom is not going to make it past their first year.",

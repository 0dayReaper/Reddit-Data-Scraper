Of course noone phrases it this way but that's the vibe I get way too often and it just annoys me everytime. I definitely consider myself introverted and I can guarantee you most everyone who knows me personally would agree with that, but I can still very much enjoy being around people without wanting to die from emberassment every second like some folks seem to be online.\n\nLast little disclaimer, I'm not trying to call out or make fun of people who genuinely have extreme trouble with most social situations, I just get annoyed when certain people pretend all introverts are like that.",

You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward\u2014reversing cause and effect. I call these the \"wet streets cause rain\" stories. Paper's full of them.\n\n&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.\n\n&gt;That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn't. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect",

These people seem to thing that a published study means something is proven to be fact. The reality is that many studies can be published and a lot of research can be done on a subject, for it all to be later proven incorrect or an incomplete model. It\u2019s as if they have a complete lack of understanding on the history of modern science and completely forget the time we thought light traveled from our eyes outward, or when we thought it traveled instantaneously, or how we thought it traveled through a medium called the either, or when we thought newton had figured out all of physics and there was nothing left to discover only for Einstein to come along with special relativity, but then Einstein didn\u2019t believe in black holes but we literally took a fucking picture of one. \n\nThe point is, we have always been wrong, are wrong now, and will be wrong in the future. Science is only possible when you accept this as an unavoidable truth, and that\u2019s ultimately what I think the \u201cyay science\u201d crowd misses.",

[\"People should make more money, billionaires bad\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByAOC/comments/lbvupf/billionaires_should_not_exist/) hardly qualifies as a 'murder by words'.\n\nOne thing this and other spam issues reddit has been suffering from has exposed to me the really poor ways for users to block and filter out this stuff. I liked r/popular except you can't easily filter out subreddits using that, unlike r/all. I avoid US sport subreddits (because I typically don't watch games live being from what Americans would call 'a European socialist utopia/hellhole' depending on their dumb political leanings) so I would rather not see those, and I'd rather not see spam subreddits like the AOC sub. \n\nSo to avoid that sub all I have to do is block the only poster. Now Reddit doesn't allow me to just block the user, I have to report him first. And who is that report going to go to? To him since he's a mod on the sub. So now I'm probably on some sort of list of redditor Nazis or something.\n\nAnother issue are the bots that spam their bot subreddits in comments, they are extremely numerous and often in those posts the account is deleted, meaning you can't report or downvote the post for some inexplicable reason. Why do the comments of deleted accounts stay on reddit?",

Much in the same way that not everyone who drinks will become an alcoholic. In fact, according to that link, about 15% of drinkers will develop a major dependency, as opposed to around 9% of marijuana users.\n\n&gt;That's just the statistics for \"severe\" addictions. They claim that between 10% and 30% of marijuana smokers will at least fall into a minor addiction. Note that neither of those statistics are 0%. You know, the threshold for \"not addictive.\"",

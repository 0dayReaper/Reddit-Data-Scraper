The trick is just a small amount of milk, and to get the blender to the point where it creates an \"ice cream vortex\" in the blender to ensure that everything will be evenly liquified and blended with the milk. If you don't get that vortex, it's nowhere near as good. And I haven't perfected the art of getting the vortex on the first try every time. I usually have to stop the blender, tilt it a bit, then quickly pop it back on the base and start it up again like 5 or 6 times before I manage to get the ice cream vortex.",

I find the other trick is to hand-mix with a spoon instead of blending. Slightly more cumbersome/messy, but the shake stays T H I C K and so delicious. My favorite (and the crowd favorite) is to grind up Oreos in a food processor (not too finely, leave it chunky), add a generous amount to vanilla ice cream with a dash of milk, mix by hand until uniform, then scoop up some peanut butter with the spoon and stick it right on in there, and add a whole-ass Oreo right into that PB for a finishing touch. Bonus points for whipped cream with a dusting of Oreo powder to finish. It\u2019s an insane amount of sugar but goddamn if it isn\u2019t heaven in a glass. Best served in a frosted pint glass.\n\nEdit: Oh and if the mixture gets lower in the glass with mixing, add more ice cream, NOT more milk. More Oreos too if the spirit moves you.",

A week later I was over at their place and sitting on the spice rack, a container of kosher salt. I asked about it and she said she had to admit, it's nice to be able to see how much salt you're adding to something.",

But to make it at home, a good heavy cast iron or griddle with a grill press sat on top so it is at a similar temp when you are ready to cook is key. You want medium heat and give it plenty of time to get up to temp and then a bit more. Lightly oil both the pan and the press with veg oil, wipe clean so there isn't excess oil. Slap on that toast, put the press on top to get even browning. When the bottom is just shy of your preferred color, fliparoo and repeat for the other side, it will go much faster. \n\nThe butter should be flavorful and high quality, I find that I tend to like the ones with stronger flavor and more yellow coloring, but color is a poor indicator due to how often it is artificially imitated. Stir in a dash of MSG and have it above room temp; I call the preferred temp \"stoveside temp\". Spread liberally, cut into triangles, and serve with the cheapest marmalade you can get your hands on.",

Fresh mozzarella has lots of water in it,  so it baiscally doesn't have a break point.  it would just melt  and maybe brown/burn a bit.   low moisture mozz full fat,  will break at like 400 f or something and will have a lot of 'grease',  low fat low moisture obviously would have less 'grease'.   a lot of pizzerias mix the two for both cost and to lower the 'grease'.   or you can you 100 full fat, but have to cook much more carefully to not break it,  that is tough to do and get the crust to set nicely.   it can be done though.    Cheddars and aged cheeses break really easy,  so if you have blends high in drier cheeses, you'll get grease.   anti-cake agents can change the cooking properties a bit, but not much.   you can taste the difference though, pre-shredded mixed with cellulose/starch don't taste right.",

And I live in Arizona.\n\nEdit: Posted this below, but I\u2019ll add the recipe here. Note that this is a fresh salsa recipe rather than cooked in any way. \n\nHere it is! \n\nTrying to remember off the top of my head since it just comes naturally at this point.\nUsing a food processor, staccato pulsing;\n\n8 Ripe and fresh Roma tomatoes; big slices, 4 ways for the first five you put in. Add rest of three tomatoes sliced eight times each after first bout of ingredients are processed lightly. \n\n1/4 to 1/3 Red Onion, diced. Put all of this in first thing.\n\nPick Cilantro off of stems and rip up, toss in after tomatoes and onions. Use as much as you like. I do about 1/3-1/2 of a bushel. \n\nPulse-blend all of this first, not too finely chopped though.\n\nAdd rest of three tomatoes.\n\nAdd jarred jalape\u00f1os, diced. As much as you like for spice. I do about 5 slices. Has to be jarred!! \n\n1 1/2 Tbsp of jarred jalape\u00f1o juice.\n\n1 tsp of Kosher salt, dumped equally over top of all ingredients. \n\nFinish pulsing ingredients to preferred consistency. (But don\u2019t make it mushy; much better closer to a pico de gallo sort of consistency). \n\nOnce you make it a few times, you get a feel for if you want more or less of a certain ingredient.\n\nEDIT: PLEASE stop exploding my inbox and  telling me how to do my recipe that you have never once made yourself, and that my family has made for decades and tastes bomb as fuck. Damn lol I didn\u2019t know salsa would be so controversial.",

Using ice just waters it down. Using frozen fruit just amplifies it.\n\nSmoothie chains have the luxury of ensuring that every single ingredient minimizes that fact-- down to the produce type and supplier they use and how it is stored and preserved.\n\nYour home smoothie doesn't have a chance at matching the richness and smoothness with conventional ingredients.

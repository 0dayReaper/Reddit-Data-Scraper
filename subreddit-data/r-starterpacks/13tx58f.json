It can be, but it can be just as much of a full life or a trap as being with more people can be. There\u2019s no one prescribed form of life that\u2019s appropriate for everyone. People should find their balance and figure out what tools they need to maintain both themselves and whatever social connections they choose to have.\n\nMy aunt has been without a partner for all of her adult life. She probably has moments that are sad and alone, but she also seems way more cheerful and enjoying retirement than a lot of people who are partnered. I also think when people are alone and feeling bad about it, they underestimate how horrible some relationships truly are. Neglectful, abusive, belittling, opportunistic type dynamics are all avoided by solitude. I still think people should find some form of social groups, but not everyone needs to have an extreme abundance of connection with others",

I went to a psychiatrist and got on Vyvanse then Zoloft, and my problems have literally disappeared entirely. For SO long I put off getting treatment and related to things like this meme, now I just wish people would understand that if your brain isn\u2019t functioning properly, it\u2019s very possible for you to fix it. \n\nNow, I said it\u2019s *almost* frustrating rather than just frustrating because I absolutely understand that some people will not have such a simple path to fixing things. I have a good job with good insurance so it costs me $30 per psych visit (I don\u2019t need to go often) and $34 a month total for both prescriptions. Some people cannot afford even that, and many others don\u2019t have insurance that will make these things even close to that cheap, and even others will not react positively to medications like my body has, so I certainly have sympathy. \n\nHowever, some of you need to hear this: if you have good health insurance, are financially stable, and struggle with mental health issues like depression and anxiety yet choose to do nothing except self-medicate with weed or sit and look at relatable memes, then you\u2019re choosing to suffer and it\u2019s your fault for not bettering yourself. I\u2019m lucky I have an awesome SO who was able to make this clear to me, but if you don\u2019t, here\u2019s your wake-up call.",

I think the critique is something that's been missing from discourse about stoicism in modern times, honestly. It's often misunderstood and sold as this miracle cure when it's just one perspective on how to deal with problems. It has pros and cons but people forget to talk about the cons.",

After a certain point, whichever specific classes stop mattering to recruiters and hiring managers and all they want is hands-on experience upon graduating. And guidance counselors need to be having more honest conversations when students are signing up for courses (which means there needs to be more of them, at least the bigger schools like the one I went to).",

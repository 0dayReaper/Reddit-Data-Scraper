I mean, we're talking, you know, graphic scenes of Dolph Lundgren really going to town on this hot, young lab tech. From behind, 69, anal, vaginal, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl-- all the hits, all the big ones, all the good ones. And then he smells crime again. He's out busting heads. Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration. Smells crime, back to the lab, full penetration. Crime, penetration, crime, full penetration, crime, penetration... And this goes on and on, and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends.",

At any given time in Hollywood there is an idea of what is beautiful, and if they cast an actress in a leading role in a big budget movie, she'll probably look like that. Lower budget films and non-action movies are a little better for this, but big budget action films pick actresses based on what look they think will appeal most to the audience. \n\n2. The fighting style is picked so it either looks cool, or is easier to do the choreography with. Picking a logical style is second to picking a style that looks good on film. Plus often the teams making the movies aren't fighting experts so they don't know what style a smaller woman would use in a fight.  \n\nThis trend is starting to turn around a little bit. Some of the female super heroes that are starting to be introduced into movies are more built, but it's still not quite there yet.",

Really pathetic attempts at humanising women using dehumanising tropey writing. It\u2019s almost not even a step forward at all because they\u2019re such shallow characters and objects for voyeurism. It\u2019s the facade of an impressive character but one which the writers were never interested in to begin with, decorated with \u201cfuck you\u201ds, guns, and karate. Essentially another male character, stripped of any original or defining personality, and often their clothes. They really think we won\u2019t be able to tell.\n\nHollywood can do better, but my honest opinion is that they don\u2019t respect us - \u2018us\u2019 as in the audience, you and I. They dumb shit down, they make it \u201ccommercial\u201d, and they think we\u2019re fucking idiots who won\u2019t notice, that or we\u2019re so dumb that we just don\u2019t care what we\u2019re watching so long as there\u2019s explosions and sex.\n\nRant complete lol I always have a rant for shit character writing - or just any shit writing - because it patronises the audience.",

It might be for the first one or two posts but then it gets old real fast. Seeing all the ways people describe their penis, vagina, sex or masturbation without using any of those words gets really tedious. \"So there I was ding-a-linging with my ding-a-long\". And they usually try to shoehorn these stupid terms into their post as many times as possible.\n\nI also hate how their posts have to be a massive story to provide unnecessary context before getting on to the actual \"fuck up\" which isn't usually that bad. And that's not even mentioning the \"obligatory this happened X years ago\" or the annoying click bait titles. It's always something that doesn't sound bad in the slightest (one of the top posts this week is \"TIFU by holding my boyfriend's hand\" or some bs like that). And why is over 50% if these stories obviously made up sex \"fuck ups\"?\n\nThere's only ever been one single story that I actually found amusing on that sub, and that's the one with woman who brought her moronic husband to dinner at her boss' house. The husband didn't like the steak so launched it out the window, not realising the window was actually closed. Both the husband and wife posted the same story from their own perspectives.",

Every time I scroll through subs like r/personalfinance or r/relationshipadvice, I have to wonder if the majority of people on this site were raised by a pack of wolves. Everything is transactional and you have no allegiance to anyone but yourself and the things/people you are directly responsible for. The moment anyone crosses you or inconveniences you in anyway, it is incumbent on you to cut them out of your life and exact revenge in a proportional way.",

I understand that some people really were raised by narcissists and having a difficult relationship with your parents is not unusual, but sometimes it feels like everyone on reddit thinks parents in general are narcissists, and good parents are the exception rather than the rule.\n\nNow, I will say that on many advice type subreddits, people are more likely to post questions if they have genuine problems. People with good, healthy family relationships are less likely to post about them and ask for advice. I'm not saying such people NEVER post to ask for advice, just that the unhealthy relationships are MORE likely to ask. But some people spend too much time in those advice subreddits and I think get a corrupted view of family relationships. It's sort of like forming your opinion about car rides by sitting in the ER all day. You're only going to see the worst results, but most car rides don't end in the ER.",

And what I got in response was a mouth-frothing tirade about how I must be the type of man from her memes.  So, I just sent her a PM to clear the air about it and say I was just trying to share my opinion about it.  And what followed was an almost incoherent waterfall of insanity.  The main post picked up, and before I knew it, I was being called a serial family abuser, and being told that they were worried for my family's safety due to my obvious abuser status.  And not by internet trolls....by friends of this girl.  All because I disagreed with her memes.  It was the most ridiculous, insane thing I have ever witnessed.  \n\nAnd the best part...I was agreeing with them for the most part, just disagreeing with a definition posted.  But that's just it: only strict acceptance was allowed...anything suggesting that you were not fully in agreement meant instant punishment.",

Her family doesn\u2019t like me, so I don\u2019t let her see them. \n\nOkay, I know this sounds bad, but hear me out.\n\nI'm a dog groomer, and I've been taking care of this elderly chihuahua for years. Whenever she came in she would seem really anxious, but as soon as she was in my booth, she would completely relax under my touch. I don't mean to brag, but I'm pretty good at my job.\n\nI thought it was pretty weird that she was always so on edge. One day she came in with these deep cuts on her hind legs. They seemed infected. I told her owners about this, and they casually told me that they were cutting off chunks of her hind legs every once in a while to sacrifice the chunks to the ancient god of the underworld Nergal. They told me that when the time comes, they would sacrifice the chihuahua's heart and soul, effectively condemning her to an eternity in the underworld.\n\nI was shocked, but I kept my cool. I calmly said word-for-word, \"I don't really think you should be cutting off chunks of your dog's legs.\" \n\nThey laughed at me and berated me. They told me I was a stinky atheist and that the reason my mom died in a forest fire was because Girra was angry with us.\n\nI hate to admit it, but I lost my cool. I said (word-for-word again), \"I'll be keeping your dog and reporting this to the proper authorities. Please leave my shop.\"\n\nAt this point they started screaming at me. They told me that all atheists smell bad and that we were all going to experience Erra's wrath. \n\nI was really hurt by that, but I decided to remove myself from the situation. I cleaned up my station and clocked out early, taking the pup with me. They tried to follow me out, but I got in my car and left. I'm at home now, and I've been tending to the dog's wounds.\n\nApparently, word of the incident got around, and now everyone's blowing up my phone calling me an asshole. My fiance\u00e9 (34F, blonde hair, green eyes, 36-24-36) told me that I was an asshole for insulting their religion and invalidating their whole belief system. \n\nI didn't think I was an asshole because I was just trying to save a dog. . . Now, I'm having second thoughts. So, Reddit, AITA?",

They left after one of them got thrown by my friend and we got to play the rest of the day. I tried to apologize the next day but he wasn't around.\n\nThe next week I heard we don't see him around anymore because he was sent to live with his extended family in L.A. I even heard his uncle was a big time judge and they lived in a mansion in Bel Air. Since I started that fight at the time, even though his life became more princely after he moved, am I still the asshole?",

It's excruciatingly clear that both sides of the exchange are written by the same person. Gilded x3. Also here is either a) someone attempting perfectly normal price negotiation or b) someone getting in touch with OP about something but there is a slight misunderstanding due to information coming from a third party.\n\n**ThereWasAnAttempt:** *\\[see WhatCouldGoWrong\\]*\n\n**RoastMe:** Here is an unsubtle attempt to promote my OF account. Roasts are unfunny, not even particularly insulting \"insults\" handed out by 14 year olds who hate women. *\"Hur hur hur I bet no one would EVER want to do the sexy time with YOU! You are UGLY\"*\n\n**LifeProTip:** Incredibly specific passive-aggressive post which is clearly only aimed at one individual and has absolutely no relevance to anyone else on Reddit. *\"LPT: if you're going to cheat on your bf with a guy in your bfs band just because your bf said you've put on too much weight and that we should take a break - make sure he actually MEANT it first. OK Sarah?\"*\n\n**WhatCouldGoWrong:** *\\[see nononono\\]*\n\n**Gaming:** *\"OMG my dad saved my PS1/SNES/N64/Sega \\[delete as applicable\\] in the attic!\".* Here is a picture that my gf painted of a scene from Zelda: Breath of the wild. Obligatory \"Skyrim coming to Samsung Smart Kettle\" gag. Obligatory post about toxicity of younger battle royale gamers - as if we wouldn't have all been arseholes and picked Oddjob if GoldenEye64 had been online.\n\n**TV:** Look what just got cancelled/picked up/another series. Criticising TV show named in thread in any way at all is an excellent method of farming downvotes and negative karma.\n\n**MurderedByWords:** Celebrities with years of public image training and experience tweet witty replies to trolls on twitter. PR professionals for major brands tweet slightly unprofessional replies to Karens on twitter. Also see \\[ConfidentlyIncorrect\\]\n\n**Pics:** Above-average looking person (gender irrelevant) posing with average art. Person is framed perfectly, art is an afterthought. Gilded x5. Piece of actually incredible art.  Dead at 76 upvotes. Possibly also person getting US Citizenship. Bonus for the occasional picture of an unopened safe OP has found in their new home - met with incredible vitriol from deeply triggered redditors who have been there before. Double-bonus if OP is new to reddit and doesn't understand why they are getting safe-hate.\n\n**nononono:** *\\[see HadToHurt\\]*\n\n**AskReddit:** Here is a totally inappropriate (sexual) question which I am hoping will give me answers I can jerk off to later when I get home from school. If Bo Burnham's \"Welcome to the Internet\" was a sub.\n\n**AITA:** Blatantly fabricated ragebait. *\"My step-sister, who is a recovering drug addict, and who lives in an apartment I bought her last year, asked me to buy her a car. Money has been tight since I lost my job due to Covid and my spouse died. I bought her a new Honda (that I remembered her saying that she liked) and she is livid that I didn't get her a Porsche Cayenne - because that's what I drive. She's now demanding that I keep the Honda and give her my Porsche. I said no and now she's stopped me seeing my two nephews who I adore. AITA here?\"* Gilded x4. Platinum x6. Argentium x2.\n\n**DataIsBeautiful:** Here is an incredibly well animated and absolutely stunning infographic video running off a completely misinterpreted or hugely problematic data source with no peer review. Bonus points for animated story map showing potential outcome of **any** US Presidential election BUT if votes from Boomers/White people/Men/Rich People were removed. Top of r/all. Gilded x765. Platinum x439. Argentium x49. Infinity free awards.\n\n**Confessions:** Here is my confession to something (almost always overly sexual) which is an absolute fantasy I have created in my head. I am a 15 year old boy who has never had a romantic encounter with anyone. I am writing the post however as if I am a 20 year old nymphomaniac woman. Possibly while jerking off.\n\n**HadToHurt:** *\\[see: WinStupidPrizes\\]*\n\n**TIFU:** Actually happened 20 years ago at high school. Semi-embarrassing story which is almost certainly fake which ends with *\"...I was reminded of this, because today is actually our 12th wedding anniversary!\"* Free awards x478. Silver x15. Or, you know, something involving a butt plug.\n\n**News:** Someone universally hated loosely faces some sort of repercussions for their actions OR someone universally liked receives recognition for their actions. Gilded x80. Ternion x6. Must be almost entirely relevant to the United States, so that anyone asking reasonable questions in the comments who is from elsewhere in the world can be belittled. If post is anything anti-Trump (or his children) then Gilded x1,479. Argentium x371. Ternion x106.\n\n**WinStupidPrizes:** *\\[see Instant\\_regret\\]*\n\n**Science:** There is now a working cure for AIDS/Cancer/Alzheimer's/Dementia. Please just gild me based on my misleading title. Definitely don't follow the link or actually read the journal article, which states that there is a *potential* for these cures to exist *within the next 150 years* and that there have been absolutely no advances with (or human trials of) these cures whatsoever at this point in time.\n\n**TwoXChromosomes:** Here is a post confirming how women are treated abysmally in society which will get cross-posted to a troll-y sub to be challenged - because cross-poster is too much of a coward to have an actual discussion with OP. Any given comment has a 1 in 5 chance of resulting in a permaban for no reason. Mere existence of the sub makes incels extremely cross.\n\n**Politics**: Welcome aboard the good ship \"Safe Space\" to all left-leaning folk and neo-liberals. Please leave any centrist or conservative worldviews at the boarding hatch. Here is a post about AOC challenging a much-hated republican on a topic but not proposing any remedy. Gilded x67.\n\n**Aww:** Here is a photo of an animal I took a screenshot of from a stranger's instagram - accompanied with a completely fabricated story about how it is a rescue animal which was severely abused that is helping my fiance through cancer treatment. Gilded x10. Platinum x2. Ternion x1. Bonus point if someone posts the direct link to the photo they stole and then OP quietly deletes the post.\n\n**Instant\\_regret:** *\\[see HoldMyBeer/Cosmo\\]*\n\n**BlackMagicFuckery:** Here is some marginally-above-entry-level slight of hand, a basic display of an interesting element of physics, or someone doing something as an absolute fluke. Anything showing laminar flow = immediate Gold.\n\n**OldSchoolCool:** Any female Hollywood star from the 40s, 50s or 60s showing some cleavage or bare legs. Someone's grandparents or great grandparents dressed like extras from Back To The Future sat on the hood of a muscle car. For ultra mega super bonus points, students in Tiananmen Square moments before things went infamously sour OR picture of \"Tank man\"/\"Unknown protester\" stood in front of tanks - which has been posted on reddit so many times that half of all redditors could probably draw it from memory.\n\n**FemaleDatingStrategy:** This has to be satire right? No one thinks like this do they? Do they?! Jesus fuck. Gold-digging ragebait toxic fuckery of the highest order. Every time a post is upvoted another incel gets their wings.\n\n**Funny:** Tonnes and tonnes of low-rent memes which aren't remotely funny and other content you will likely not find funny if you are either a) someone who has used the internet previously, b) over 14 years of age, c) someone who has already seen keyboard cat or other similar content, or d) someone who has never seen a business post a witty reply to a karen before. Very occasionally that dude who invents pointless things, who actually IS quite funny.\n\n**ThatHappened:** Here is a screenshot of a post from Facebook or Twitter which is very very very obviously meant to be deliberate satire, but has r/whoosh'd the OP.\n\n**UnpopularOpinion:** Behold. Here is either a) incredibly baity and genuinely extremely unpopular opinion which is almost certainly not OPs actual opinion because its fucking stupid or deliberately incendiary... e.g. *\"Bill Cosby deserved to be released from prison because he's old\"* OR b)  ludicrously popular opinion that absolutely no one in their right mind would argue against... e.g. *\"Bill Cosby should not have been released from prison... and before anyone says anything THIS IS an unpopular opinion because ONE former co-worker tweeted something in support of him. Mods don't remove\".*\n\n**HoldMyBeer/HoldMyCosmo:** *\\[see ThereWasAnAttempt\\]*\n\n**PersonalFinance:** Either *\"I just made $1.2bn on Crypto. How should I best invest this money so I have enough when I retire?\"* or *\"I have just been offered a job at my firm's major competitor. The salary is a $350k a year increase on my current $650k salary - but would mean working an extra 4hrs per month. Does it seem like it's worth it?\"*\n\n**Nextfuckinglevel:** Professional sports-person deliberately loses to a child in some sort of staged sporting event. Usually tennis. Bonus point if \"member of the public\" opponent has a visible physical disability, but is more than capable of giving the sports-person a bit of a contest... but sports-person deliberately underperforms in a way that borders on patronising.\n\n**PewDiePieSubmissions**: \"Memes\" made by children using the Family Guy plot-generator manatee from South Park. Only the manatee is a gold fish and that gold fish is dead.\n\n***Bonus:*** *calling out any of the above results in being downvoted back to the days of AOL and brigaded with* \"r/nothingeverhappens\" *comments.*",

I've never seen him happier, which is great, but then he shouted \"Here's Johnny!\" To clarify, his name is not Johnny. I climbed out of the window as I usually do during his episodes. I lured him into the hedge maze and just now I found him there frozen in place, axe in hand (it's really cold outside rn). Should I be concerned? Do you think he might be having an affair?",

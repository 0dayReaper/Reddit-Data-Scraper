An oddly dressed schlub that wanders around screaming at people, beating them up, and delivering product placement while bagging a woman out of his league who loves him unconditionally?   \n  \nThe genius is that the direction is so good though that they just reframe his character as someone different by presenting him with an anxiety disorder and using different music to make it uncomfortable instead of comedic.  \n  \nDitto for Uncut Gems. It's just the world's worst-dressed, biggest basketball fan bustling around New York screaming at people, flashing product, and banging a hottie half his age.  \n  \nThe only thing that changes in Sandler movies is how much energy he dedicates towards playing that same character.",

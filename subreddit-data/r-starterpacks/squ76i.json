I do think it's worth noting that most of these \"cleanups\" are in fact just cleanups, not just throwing away peoples' belongings and kicking them out. They've gotten to the point where many of them are occurring on a weekly basis, are detailed with notices on when they'll be happening (so they shouldn't come as a surprise) and for the most part are just cleaning out trash, feces and other \"waste\". Most of the cities are providing free storage for any belongings if they choose to keep them, and they have been offering free hotel stays (long term) for anyone willing to take them up on it. That does mean \"following the rules\" though (no drugs, curfews, and probably some others) which causes many of them to not accept the offer. \n\nIt has gotten to be a \"room cleaning\" type of thing for these encampments, where the city will clean them up once a week (or whichever frequency) and then they'll return that same day until the next \"cleanup\". \n\nIs this the right way to handle it? That's the debatable part, and I think however you look at it will differ your opinion. Offering free hotel stays and storage (again, in exchange for \"following the rules\") is, I believe, a great opportunity for those who really do want to get out of their situation. I'm not sure what other services are offered for rehab, so I can't comment on that. \n\nOffering to clean up the encampments weekly is helpful for those who do not take them up on the other offers of help, since they're not living in a bigger mess, and locals aren't \"dealing with it\"\n\nThat last part sounds bad: locals see it as a nuisance. But that is the honest truth. When I have a few tents outside of my apartment within 25 feet, at the local park, in the alleys, along the freeways or outside of the grocery store.. it's not something that I want to come home to or feel safe around. I've personally been harassed or \"attacked\"/put into very uncomfortable situations dozens of times in the last year. It's gotten much worse during the pandemic, and that's not to take away from how bad it is for those who are homeless, but the \"new normal\" of living in our own, un-preventable conditions should also be recognized. \n\nWhat's the solution? I really don't know. \n\nI'm not sure if you live in the LA area, or others similarly affected with this, but it's gotten absolutely crazy lately. Broken down/abandoned RVs running power to tent cities inside of parks (often causing fires), piles of trash everywhere, waking up to people sleeping in your front yard or wandering around in a mentally unfit state.. isn't normal. And in a time when everyone is trying to be clean and safe (due to Covid), it makes it much worse for everyone to live in.",

The honest to god solution to ending homelessness lies in zoning laws, but the same people who are uncomfortable with homeless people being around the city (which I totally understand), are often the same people who often rally to block any meaningful legislation. \n\nHotel vouchers are fine, but it's like slapping a band-aid on a gaping wound. The measures that California is taking simply isn't helping to alleviate the issue, it's only kicking it down the road.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure about other areas of the state, but for us about 80% of the homeless population was locals. It is largely a myth that homeless people are loaded onto greyhound buses and shipped in from other states. Yes it has happened, but it's not common.\n\nThe same reason that our rent keeps going up is the same reason why we have a homeless crisis. Actually effective zoning laws that allow for high density housing simply do not pass. It's a supply and demand issue. Demand for housing isn't going to go down. We have to increase the supply.",

The vast majority (but again, not all) of the homeless people I encounter have mental illness, drug problems or something otherwise keeping them from functioning normally. I've never worked with them directly, so I'm just basing it off of my own experience, but new housing in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Beverly Hills isn't the solution (or the entire solution), even if it were provided free, I feel that there are further issues that need to be addressed. Even if housing were provided free, I don't think that would be enough to solve this issue. It would just remove part of the element from the streets and into houses, but the underlying issues would still exist. \n\nIn the cases of someone actually needing housing to get off of the streets, this would absolutely help. But I think in the majority of cases there needs to be more than just providing houses.",

The average price of a home in California is $1M. It's basically a rich man's state. And on top of that, California is by far the most resistant to low-income housing. The public constantly claims that they support low-income housing, but they constantly vote down every plan to build low-income housing in their areas. NY is actually trying to fight their homelessness crisis by actually building new low-income housing complexes like Essex Crossing in Queens.\n\nEdit: I don't know anything about what Chicago is doing though. Also, California, and especially LA, need to get their act together quickly, because LA is going to be hosting the Olympics in 2028. The whole world watching an endlessly growing sea of homeless people on the streets while the wealthy just keep on walking by like everything is fine in the middle of the heart of all the Olympic festivities will be a national embarrassment if California doesn't start putting their money where their mouth is immediately.",

So many of the business stopped getting traffic that used to land right there. On top of that, most of those businesses (coffee shops, florists, hair salons) served the thousands of people working downtown in all the offices, as there is almost no housing there. Once everyone worked from home, all of those businesses closed, and the offices are empty, so there is literally no reason to be downtown and why everything is boarded up. It\u2019s a ghost town which gives the homeless free reign.\n\nI was in PHX for a work a few weeks ago, and I know they have problems as well, but I couldn\u2019t get over how nice everyone was and how clean the city was. I love Seattle but this place was been decimated. Luckily, there is so much industry here between tech and shipping it come come back, but it\u2019s going to take years.",

Greater LA is more than half the population of Texas (the country\u2019s second most populated state) \n\nAnd yes other states do dump their homeless in LA, and the relaxed politics and non extreme weather certainly feeds to the homelessness issue, however the biggest reason is housing. The US in general has gotten really bad at building as much housing as is needed, doubled with the fact that LA is very poorly designed (suburb and car oriented) which just leads to an extreme waste of space, NIMBYS galore, and lack of density to support proper housing and transportation (despite LA being the most dense metropolitan area in the country, just highlights the mess city planners created in the 50s)",

The thing that sucked was that neither of us had a car, so we had to lug them onto the bus and when I asked my manager about donating the food to a shelter, he informed me that apparently shelters won\u2019t take food from restaurants or businesses because they have no idea how fresh the food is.

It\u2019s tough because I know how drugs and substance abuse destroys people firsthand, since one of my cousins went down that rabbit hole. A lot needs to be done, and I think the streets of LA should be shown worldwide so that people can stop fantasizing Hollywood to the point where everybody picks their whole life up and goes. It\u2019s not easy, but changes need to be made, and i think our politicians need to be held accountable, as well as the vultures who began the whole idea of real estate investments and flipping home.",

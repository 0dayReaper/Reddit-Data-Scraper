It makes the game more luck focused and last longer.\n\n* Play to win. If you have an outside chance of winning, buy as many houses as possible. If you have no sets, force though a mediocre trade. This will make the game substantially shorter, and more intense.\n\n* Do not play with less than 4 and more than 6. This flaw is common in many board games.

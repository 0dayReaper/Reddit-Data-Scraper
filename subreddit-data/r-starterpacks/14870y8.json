She's a teenager, and now she's being faced with her own lascivious nature, and her rejection and shadow comes from the preconception that it makes her into a slut.

Naotos whole character is about sexism that women are seen as less competent than men and Naoto pretends to be male so she doesnt get belittled because she is a women not because she identifies as a male. And chie is about her insecurity of not being a \"proper women\" like Yukiko but a tomboy who likes meat and martial arts and doesnt act lady like and how society expects her to behave. Also im pretty sure the Yosuke romance was cut because it doeant fit in his whole social link because its about Yosuke accepting that Saki is gone and there would be pretty big tonal whiplash when he then instantly starts to date yu. Also his homophobia was probably because of the time the game came out like until the mid 2010s homophobia was widely accepted.",

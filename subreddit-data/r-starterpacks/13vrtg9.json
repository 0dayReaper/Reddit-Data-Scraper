Is it known nationwide? \n\nLike people will debate whether it's \"worse\" (it rules) than some of the trash beach towns in Florida.\n\nI guarantee the Pacific has some trash beach drunken shitholes as well... But, is Myrtle Beach infamous nationwide? Like, go there, once you're a bit drunk it's a \"vibe\" unique to the area, you feel One with trash. You can't be sober there. Everyone has to be drunk and on the same level, the streets are drunk too it's wild.\n\nEdit: I'm in Virginia. Myrtle's an 8 hour drive for a fucked up week or weekend lol. Done it a few times. Great for the kind of bachelor parties that involve bailing someone out of jail\n\n-Or, true story. When one of the crew is in the drunk tank still drunk as shit and another member of the group goes in later and the first one thinks they're bailing them out and it's like nope we both in jail now lol\n\nAlso true story, we'd usually have to go to the hardware store before leaving our rental house to replace a fucken window or something stupid\n\nAlso: When locals fight on the beach they use their beach chairs as weapons! If you don't see the fight, but happen upon some derilect, bloodied beach chairs, you know what happened there.",

It's Harley's, pawn shops, beach stores, and antique places with nothing of value.\n\nBeaches are pretty nice though.",

Alan Moore has said that if batman existed in real life, hed be a lunatic. Rorschach was meant to be that. Dr. Manhattan was meant to be a superman-type. So powerful that he can no longer relate to humans. \n\nWatchmen was so well received that it\u2019s original message was lost. Authors that can after drew inspiration from the ascetics but not the message. \n\nWhen you group watchmen with the silver and bronze age comics it was talking about, it\u2019s message clearly stands out. When you lump it in with the deadpool and cables et al that followed, it loses its original context.",

Just a fine tuned PS2 era collectathon with a silent protagonist and wise cracking furry sidekick. I really didn't care for Jak 2. It was basically the opposite, a ton of ideas and mechanics thrown together that just felt awkward. Plus if I remember right there were a few missions that were just mind-bogglingly, unfairly difficult. Jak and Daxter is a comfort game for me. I tried Jak 2 again a couple years ago and was instantly just generally frustrated and not having fun.",

The starting segment where you can toss around TIE fighters like they\u2019re nothing is still hitting really well in 2023. \n\nI also prefer to play old games than new ones so take my opinion with a grain of salt!",

But in some ways, that was a little bit restricting for us. While we always aim to give the player freedoms of certain kinds, there were certain things that format didn't really afford in giving people freedom. Of course, the series continued to evolve after Ocarina of Time, but I think it's also fair to say now that we've arrived at Breath of the Wild and the new type of more open play and freedom that it affords. Yeah, I think it's correct to say that it has created a new kind of format for the series to proceed from.\n\n\u2014[Eiji Aonuma](https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2023/05/12/interview-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-the-state-of-zelda-with-aonuma-and?amp)",

Fans loved Sonic colours when it released and were tired of the serious stories, and it's only when Forces released that everyone started hating on it; and 2. Unleashed and Colors aren't \"dramatically\" different tone wise, most of Unleashed is pretty cartoony aside for the intro, the ending and one scene",

People LOVE fun slice of life stuff like The Murder of Sonic The Hedgehog, but there's also a massive amount of genuine nostalgia for the edgy black hedgehog and his guns. People love Sage, and she's basically an edgy hacker girl, but she also has that \"eggman's daughter\" vibe where people can get meta and meme about Eggdad. I feel like the ideal Sonic story is one that is still earnest and cheesy and campy with genuine heartfelt emotion, but gives the characters room to just breathe and relax in the downtime. There's no reason we should have to pick between JUST Colours vibes or JUST Unleashed vibes! The IDW comics suffer from tonal whiplash at times, but are solidly enjoyable nontheless and serves as clear proof the writers *can* competently switch between tones. I hope they're given the freedom to do so in a mainline or even a spinoff game one day",

Neither one was really \"edgy\" and if anything, Raimi's SM3 mocked \"edginess\". I mean, this is the movie that had emo-Peter dancing in the street. \n\nBut yeah, Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man wasn't really edgy either. He was snarkier, sure, but edgy? Nah. Those movies were catering to an even *younger* audience than Raimi's.",

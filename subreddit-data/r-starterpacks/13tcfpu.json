As someone who is neurodivergent, I\u2019ve always interpreted \u201cbe yourself at work\u201d as not having to go through constant burnout from masking all of the time. It\u2019s so exhausting. I\u2019m perfectly kind and friendly but have had superiors tell me I\u2019m not social enough, I don\u2019t participate in enough \u201coptional\u201d outings with coworkers and team, etc. There\u2019s a lot of classism and ableism in corporate culture that makes being authentic in the workplace nearly impossible for NDs.",

And the alternative is to realize it\u2019s not, it\u2019s all bullshit, society is a lie- is a much harder pill to swallow for some.\n\nCause once you do that you can\u2019t look at it the same and you realize you have to still play the game. And it\u2019s a game that is not for the feint of heart, especially for noble, ethical people- it will challenge you, it will put you in situations where your values and who you are are tested, it will show you that you can have a heart of gold and work your butt off but in the end, you can still fail colossally, you can still objectively lose. And that sucks.\n\nSo you have to \n\n1. Become better then the world, in some ways I believe that this is kind of manifesting the idea of \u201cbe the change you want to see in the world\u201d in your actions. And that is a hard road to toe too, in the corporate world- absolutely, in any facet of our society now. Integrity is dead and respect for one another is at an all time low. People in the working class have begun commoditizing their own workplace alliances, and playing the \u201cgame\u201d which enables the systemic bullshit of that specific world. \n\nYou have to hang onto your beliefs and demonstrate your values even though the place you work may frown upon them, it may even bite you in the ass. This is incredibly difficult, as one will becgin to realize that those values are a farce, and the corporate world is much easier when you apply the nice \u201cvalues \u201con a \u201cwhen it\u2019s convenient too or sounds good to say them\u201d basis. Because at some point, you will get challenged on your integrity, it happens, especially when you work in corporate world, and if you really have integrity. You are going to have to do the right thing, and sometimes- that may be the \u201cwrong\u201d thing to do to advance in the \u201cgame\u201d. \n\nIt becomes incredibly difficult to navigate when you start looking at the payoffs and how one expresses their values. Sometimes, I\u2019ve learned- honesty fucks you over, loyalty doesn\u2019t mean shit, values are just pretty ideas- unless your around people who collectively\n\n2. Succumb too the nihilism, accept it, begrudingly- stay in the fight by hanging onto something- a dream, a loved one who depends on you, your plan for retirement, hope- whatever, hang onto that happy place you want to go to because hoping and fighting for something in this world, is better then living, existing and dying for nothing. So even if the world is shit, we can still fight our own battles that have purpose and in a way- still define life on one\u2019s own terms now. I think this is ideal- your not accepting the meritocaracy, but in some way taking your agency back by using it as a tool to leverage for your interests. Your still being exploited, but at least you have your dignity. \n\nWhen you look at the mindset you have to develop, and that\u2019s just me oversimplifying it as a deconstructed corporatism, capitalism and my relationship too it (how I think about \u201cwork\u201d how I look at \u201cwork\u201d, questioning my beliefs about corporate culture, and the mythology of capitalism: ie \u201cCEOs must be wealthy because they are morally right\u201d, \u201cwealthy people are wealthy because they worked hard, not because they had advantages\u201d, . \n\nSome people find it easier to not look in that direction, and to those, ignorance is bliss, but they waste themselves thinking they are going to get ahead and make it by being loyal, and being honest to the boss even if that means heads have to roll\u2026 and are suprised when if doesn\u2019t happen. Like- what did you expect? You were loyal to the corporate equivalent of a fucking alligator or bear, you honestly think an entity like that is your friend? No, it\u2019s going to behave like a company and use you until you no longer serve its purposes from a profit and cost perspective. Meaning, it\u2019ll rip your fucking face off on a whim if it needs too lol.",

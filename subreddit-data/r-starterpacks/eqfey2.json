Especially when the water washes gooigi out, Luigi gets attacked by Helen Gravely, and the lasers hit all at once. It helped me to quickly switch from gooigi back to Luigi whenever Helen Gravely goes to hit and use Jump to push her back, then immediately switch back to gooigi to keep doing your thing underneath. This gives you a decent amount of time to get 1 or 2 of the switches off. Rinse and repeat.",

It would be one thing if the story was interesting, but it isn\u2019t. I *know* they worked hard on the game, it\u2019s positively overflowing with content, but that hard work does *not* show in the cutscenes.\n\nEdit: And that\u2019s not a good reason even if they were amazing cutscenes.",

Those Monster intros are an incredibly egregious mistake that wastes the precious few first encounters players have with a new monster. The first encounter should be an exciting \"wait wtf is this?\" Organic, emergent moment where the player finds something and intereperets what they're seeing by themselves, putting themselves in the shoes of the character they're playing. Excitement at finding new unknown monster tracks, following the trail like a kid chasing a new toy, or just randomly stumbling upon a monster in the wild and observing it. \n\nThis is how I feel to some extent about every cutscene. They pretty much shouldn't even be in games, period. EVERY moment would be more impactful if it was in the player's hands.",

So I was going to donate money to the \"help puppies with cancer\" organization, but after some research I discovered that they actually kill and eat the puppies and keep the money. So I decided to donate to the sick homeless charity instead.\n\nAITA?",

After that I handed her the keys to a brand new car and tickets to that thing she likes along with another bouquet of flowers except these flowers were made out of her birthstone and spelled out a quote from her favorite Hallmarck movie. So anyway she started crying while sucking my dick and thanking me for what a wonderful person I am that\u2019s totally better than all of you desperate lonely hoes lmao. AITA?",

It's because every time reddit redesigns the layout and \"upgrades the interface and appearance\" it becomes more appealing to the type of people that the old format weeded out. \n\nI thought reddit looked like shit at first and it took me like 2 years to creat an account and quit lurking, but now I'd say every other 13 year old in the country has an account and actively uses it. \n\nBack in the day we used a term called \"Summer Reddit\" when you could tell the quality of posts and comments/discussion dropped noticably when all the kids were out of school, but that all sort of vanished and morphed and blurred until it's just the way things are now. \n\nI think maybe social media platforms have life spans. Expiration dates. It's like that bar in town you kept telling people about and then one day you walk in and everyone in your neighborhood is there, and everyone you went to highschool with, and all your teachers, and your Mom and little brother and his friends, and what the fuck there are children in here, and \"Oh shit is this an Applebee's now? FUCK...\"",

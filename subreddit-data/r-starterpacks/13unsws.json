Sounds like they had a good plan for it.  I just worry so many don't.  It's really easy to look at the positive factors and ignore some of the negative ones.\n\nI think I'm just biased as I have a few close friends who are in trailers and they are such sweet people but just not the brightest.  They are easily misled, unfortunately.  They love dollar stores for the \"great\" deals but just see a lower price rather than using price per ounce, for example.  Or they look at low monthly payments rather than total price or high interest rates.",

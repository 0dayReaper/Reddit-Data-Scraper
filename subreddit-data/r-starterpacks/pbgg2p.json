Antique stores in the 80s and 90s had actual vintage items with value. By around 2005-10 all the valuable items had been placed on EBay. If you go to an antique store today a few items here and there might be being sold for more than $10, but their actual EBay value is less than $10.\n\nThere was a time when what your mom did was viable. IE buying stuff at the swaps, thrifts, yard sales,\u2026 and selling it for a profit. \n\nToday it\u2019s not viable. Swaps are 99% new junk, thrifts are 99% fasts fashion clothes, people know what their stuff is worth so they don\u2019t let it go for pennys on the dollar any more during yard sales.",

They scour garage sales, flee markets, and thrift shops for deals. Then sell it on Ebay/Etsy/Local store. A $2 piece being sold for $100 on Ebay isn't uncommon.",

If property values are too high an antique shop's revenues will not be able to pay the rent, and commercial rent is usually directly related to the profitability of retail in the area\n\nSo if you see an antique shop, you can usually bet you're in a low value commercial area",

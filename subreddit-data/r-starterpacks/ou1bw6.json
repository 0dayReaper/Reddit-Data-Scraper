Ellen Ripley and Imperator Furiosa are strong female  action characters done right. They are complex, they have experienced trauma, they have moments of weakness and struggle, they aren\u2019t arrogant and trust other people (men even!) they have caring maternal instincts to care for their chosen family, they don\u2019t have a chip on their shoulders to prove \u201cwomen can be badass too!\u201d, they just do what they need to survive in their world.",

When I said she was more like a pet to me, I meant that in the most literal way possible. Remember that time you found a dog collar under the couch and I told you it's because we were getting you a dog? That was a lie, son. Truthfully, your mom likes it when I put her on a leash and walk her around the back yard. She's usually naked, of course. I can't explain why, but the whole thing is her idea. She'll piss on tress, sleep in dog cages, chew up furniture -- she once took a full-sized, adult woman shit in my Dockers. Your mother is one fucked-up slut, Mark. And I love her, but I'm not bringing that energy back to Viltrum with me. Frankly? She scares me sometimes. I don't know who molested her or how they did it, but there is some dark juju in that woman's head and I just don't know if I'm strong enough to fuck it all away.",

If you do that you won\u2019t need stimulants to drudge through the day. \n\nThese are sometimes the same people who make fun of others for sleeping a full night and pride themselves on surviving on six hours or less. Good for them, enjoy your higher rate of developing mental and physical diseases because you refuse to take responsibility and sleep properly. ",

I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because I normally have fairly low blood pressure, so when my salt levels drop my blood pressure gets even lower and causes the headaches. And since I drink a lot of water in a day I pass out a lot of salt so it\u2019s kind of a vicious cycle in my experience xD!",

Chronic alcohol use upregulates the p450 isoform (CYP2E1) that metabolizes acetaminophen, leading to more buildup of an intermediate called NAPQI. That intermediate normally undergoes glutathione metabolism into a harmless metabolite, but with too much NAPQI, the glutathione machinery gets overwhelmed, NAPQI builds up, and hepatotoxicity results.",

Ibuprofen doesn't exactly cause that much damage, the worst it might do is cause some irritation to your stomach lining, but that only happens if you are consuming a LOT of both. \n\nIf you only drink once every week or two, and aren't drinking to extremes and take 400mg of ibuprofen in the morning, nothing is going to happen. If you are drinking to extremes and drinking often, and also taking lots of ibuprofen every time you drink? You are gonna have problems. \n\nAspirin is similar to ibuprofen, but is more irritating to your stomach. Regardless, the majority of those who take aspirin for a hangover will be fine. \n\nTylenol is by far the worst. Don't mix it with alcohol, at all. Again, chances are you will be fine, but its a MUCH higher chance of causing damage than others. ",

Waking up at ass o'clock was one of the worst parts of high school for me. \n\nBut also, even as adults, some people seem to naturally gravitate towards sleeping/waking later, and it sucks to be one of them, because I feel groggy all of the time. Whenever I have a long holiday and get to sleep/wake on my own schedule, I always end up feeling way better even though I sleep the same amount.  ",

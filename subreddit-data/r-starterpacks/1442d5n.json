It's not like the dudes who groped me in HS still harass me when they see me in public, and one of them is now a semi-famous influencer/TikTok in my country with a gym girlfriend, while I'm struggling with the exams on a public IT college, so I don't even have the time to even think about going on a date.\n\nAnd now I can't even spell on the Internet.\n\nFan-fucking-tastic\n\nEdit: I guess I have to tell the whole story because people are starting flame wars in the comments: when I was in high school, a couple of dudes thought it would be funny if they \"accidentally\" groped me in the gym locker room before P.E. They also pushed their bodies against mine against the wall while telling me how \"breedable\" I was. I told our teacher, but it just became worse since I was now a tattle tail. The worst moment was when one of the dudes randomly grabbed my crotch during class as a \"prank\". It's been 2 years since High School and these dudes stopped groping me in public but they are still colossal pricks and think of those SA as \"jokes among the bois\", while the influencer dude is acting all nice and shit.",

Im still working my way through it but I just want to say that therapy really helped me when I was at the lowest point. You already recognize a lot of your own symptoms which shows a high level of emotional maturity. Even if therapy is not for you, I want you to know that it's not your fault, and that its okay for you to be upset. Good luck OP, it gets better.",

In 100% of instances, when a woman is raped in a movie, it is played as a tragedy; but when a man is raped in a movie, it is played as a comedy. I believe that references to men getting raped is actually more frequent in movies than that of women, precisely because society thinks that rape is such a hilarious joke. But if I said \"main stream society thinks rape is hilarious\" almost everyone would reply \"No... most people think its horrible when women get raped.\"",

I cannot tell you how many of my male coworkers (we are all in highschool) will slap or grab each others asses. The weird part is they will be like \u201cbro stop\u201d but like sorta smiling saying that, but the other guys won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s as if the \u201cno means no rule\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to guys unless it\u2019s like a hard screaming no or something. I don\u2019t understand the male joke flirting, but I REALLY don\u2019t understand the physical part and just how consenting it actually is. Many guys don\u2019t take no seriously, and that is equal or possibly even more true to other men than women.\n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest here, I have never seen or heard of a man getting raped and it being comedic. If there\u2019s a media that includes this I would be interested to hear about that, but I never see it. What I DO see however is more minor stuff that would be seen as way worse against a girl, but if it\u2019s a guy to another guy it\u2019s suddenly either okay or funny. Feel free to drop some examples of what you\u2019re talking about though, I may just coincidentally be avoiding the medias you\u2019re talking about.",

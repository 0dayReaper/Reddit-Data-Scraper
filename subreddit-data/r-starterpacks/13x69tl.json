                    "comment": "A radar detector is a device you mount in your car that detects police radar/laser signals. Police use radar/laser guns to measure your speed and hand out tickets.\n\nFrom left to right:\n\nRDForum.org is a site for radar detector enthusiasts.\n\nVortex Radar is a well-known tester and reviewer of radar detectors.\n\nBSM stands for Blind Spot Monitoring. BSM systems also function using radar, which causes false alerts on radar detectors.\n\nThe Valentine One and the Uniden R8 are two top-performing and competing radar detectors.\n\nRadenso Theia, labeled with (vaporware), is an AI-powered radar detector that has been promised for years and is likely never going to be released.\n\nThe system labeled with (can't afford) is a laser jammer system.\n\nThe Mazda CX-5 is hated for its BSM system emitting frequencies that are identical to police K-band radar.\n\nFrequency readout is a feature that shows you the frequency of radar you are being shot with. Memorizing the frequencies allows you to determine which brand of radar gun you are being shot with.\n\nArrows &gt; no arrows refers to a feature of high-end radar detectors that point to the source of the radar.\n\nKa 2/5/8 refers to band segmentation, a feature where the radar detector can be set to scan only frequencies used by police radar. This reduces false alerts.\n\nX-band is an outdated band of radar that has been phased out in nearly all of the US.\n\nJBV1, like Waze, is an app that shows crowd-sourced information about police, road hazards, etc.\n\nRadar detectors are illegal in Virginia and Washington D.C.\n\nThe chart is just a chart that shows the tested range of different radar detectors.\n\nCobra is a brand infamous for making poor-quality radar detectors.\n\nPSL stands for Posted Speed Limit. LEO stands for Law Enforcement Officer.\n\nI hope this helps!",

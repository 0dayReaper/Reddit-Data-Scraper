The so caleld \"ball that wasn't that big\" was bigger than my fist , and yes it was me on my knees with gloves getting rid of his turd (as he did this operation while doing his business etc). And I took a decission of whether having to deal with this or live with toilet water on my appartment or calling the plumber ($$$). So I got it done and he saids \"well as I said it must have swollen\" that's not how aluminium works mate. And you could think oh stupid shit college kids do no, this jerk was in his early 30's. No more room mates for me, I did this to do him a favour (he got divorced had nowhere to crash and after lockdown I felt why not it's like having a pet that you can talk to) and I couldn't stand him due to \"shit like this\" (no pun intended) . So no, the pet will not give you the hassle some egocentric entitled manchild douchebag will.",

There was a kitchen garbage can that I would empty before I started cooking so I could toss bits in.\n\nI soon realized that since I emptied it on a predictable schedule, none of the other 3 room mates emptied it at all, which while annoying was really just the cost of living with other 20 year old men.\n\nBut one of them took the irritation too far. He would bring out trash stored in his room and fill up the kitchen trash as soon as I took it out. So I would go outside with trash, come back in to find that it was full again.\n\nI stopped taking it out, I kept my own trash, which I carried to the dumpster. Those guys just let it pile up over the course of two weeks. There was a mountain of it.\n\nThey confronted me as to why I'm not taking it out as if it was my job. I still don't understand the situation. All three of them were their own kind of mess.",

My career has me changing jobs frequently and moving all over the country, but the jobs all provide housing, which turns my coworkers into my roommates.\n\nMy last job, I had 7-10 roommates at a time. It was amazing, we all got along super well. We were all respectful and chipped in for supplies and tidying up, and we would watch movies together, play board games, etc.\n\nMy current job has me living with just one roommate. Just one. She is a nightmare. I do all the cleaning and provide all the supplies without her chipping in at all (if I don\u2019t, she refuses to and we\u2019re just stuck). Right now she hates my guts because of a work incident, so she\u2019s been intentionally making the kitchen as filthy as possible. She also physically blocked me from getting to my room so she could scream at me for said incident. But there\u2019s a distinct possibility she\u2019ll be fired next week, so maybe I won\u2019t have to put up with it much longer.",

Some of the best restaurants in the US, including michelin star ones, are located in strip malls around the LA area.  A huge mishmash of cultures and cuisines.  A typical strip mall in LA has a laundromat, korean restaurant, Oaxacan or other Mexican, Thai or Chinese, and a donut shop.  And then somebody making tacos and pupusas on the street right outside.",

I'm not special and this starter pack has probably been done 12 times this week. \n\ni just had to make this because it is our only, and i really cant emphasize this enough, our only commercially zoned areas. It's just suburbs, office parks, warehouse districts, strip malls. All connected to each other by highways, and off the highways are large 4-8 lane feeder roads. I don't understand why people here are just cool with it either. It's terrible and a choice that urban planners made. it can be unmade just the same.",

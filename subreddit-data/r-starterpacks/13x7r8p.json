Sure, you *can* ask them to do that, but it\u2019s a bit of a dick move instead of just taking 10 minutes yourself after they leave to tidy up. Sure you can ask no one use your towels when you have a pool, or be a super accommodating host and grab a guest set of towels at Costco for like\u2026 $15. \n\nBeing a kind host and doing a little bit extra to make your friends feel welcomed goes a long way.",

I have seen various MIL stories, but I haven't understood the thing about the dress too small? Is it a specific story? And where do you stand about it? I'm kind of confused, sorry.

It will be like \u201cmy fat friend asked to borrow my dress but it\u2019s way too small for her and she blew up at me when I said no\u201d. I\u2019ve seen one or two where the fat friend stole the dress anyway and broke it. Other variations include the fat person having a tantrum when they\u2019re told they can\u2019t ride a bike or a horse or get on a carnival ride. \n\nI think it\u2019s a dumb caricature of fat people, like they\u2019re not aware of their size.",

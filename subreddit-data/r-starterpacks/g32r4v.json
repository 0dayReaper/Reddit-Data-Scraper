But Planet Sheen was just so awful that it hurt. All the creativity and legitimately funny humor from JN was replaced by \u201ctoilet humor\u201d and slapstick in PS. \n\nSure, PS was animated better, but that\u2019s a given seeing how JN was early 2000\u2019s CGI. Even then, JN had a more \u201crealistic\u201d color palette while PS\u2019s had this ultra-bright assault on your eyes. \n\nAlso, JN\u2019s theme song was and still is great, imo. PS\u2019s theme song was straight up trash, iirc.",

The core of the story between a father wanting to spend more time with his growing son but learning that he has to let go and a son wanting to be more on his own but realizing that his dad deserves a bigger role in his life is very mature and relatable.",

It does such a good job of depicting how parenting styles can impact a teenager's emotional growth, and what it really means to be a good dad.\n\nThe contrast between Goofy and Pete is incredible. As a kid I never recognized how much it went against the norm with Goofy's vulnerable, humanistic parenting style. https://youtu.be/nGJyCLRR9rc?t=109",

Lucy had ambitions and talents. Ricky was more of a partner than most of the husbands.",

As the stereotypical template for \u2018intelligence\u2019 goes on being filled in, the \u2018genius\u2019 may also be shown to be clueless about friendships or romantic relationships. If it\u2019s a movie or TV show, then \u2018intelligent\u2019 characters (usually villains) have British accents.\n\n&gt; [...] Hollywood\u2019s concept of intelligence has nothing to do with cognitive work. Instead it\u2019s a social stereotype. It\u2019s about what \u2018intelligent characters\u2019 wear, how they talk, how many of them it takes to change a lightbulb.",

Usually the Superego and Ego. A 200IQ ID is usually Evil Mad Scientist territory and they snapped or is the big bad.\n\nThe Attractive Loser was actually a winner early in their career, love life, or both until one event causes their downfall and is ostracized within their social or industry circle. The Attractive Loser is searching for the MacGuffin and usually needs the help of 200IQ or visa versa to get back to positive social standing within their peers. Likes working in their own mess and reluctantly works with 200IQ with the strong suggestion of Annoyingly Dumb. Usually, the Ego but can also be the Id simultaneously.\n\nThe Annoyingly Dumb character is the 3rd wheel for the group and is usually the longtime friend or acquaintance of The Attractive Looser. Annoying Dumb is usually on smidge higher standing than Attractive Loser. Annoying Dumb character usually questions Attractive Looser's quest for Mac Guffin but they go along with the adventure. Usually, the ID and have gimps of an Ego when they have moments of clarity.\n\nThe Annoyingly Dumb character is the Average Guy character the audience will relate to and does double duty as The Tank--the one with the huge guns--he also acts as The Heart within the trio and will have one heartfelt or wise quote or comment to either Attractive Loser or the 200IQ character to either: go for your dreams, tell the truth, or fall in love it's not bad. They influence the 200IQ and Attractive losers to start the beginning of a relationship or implied they copulate. Then we go into the sequel!",

And the racism! I\u2019ve seen clips of that one show about a nanny and holy shit the Indian kid why were the script writers not stopped?",

(may or may not come with annoying twin sister who is obsessed with princesses and is equally annoying)\n* black friend of teenage daughter who is gay-coded enough to get us brownie points without actually making us do anything that'll get the PTO mad!\n* funny old person!\n\nwatch, through 6+ seasons that become a totally different show by the end, as these characters undergo no growth and remain the exact same, even when previous episodes show them \"learning lessons\"!",

Not talking Bar &amp; Grill, but dive bars, clubs, rowdy bars with a dance floor, karaoke bars, basically places where you get drinks and mingle to a degree. Many are entirely local concept (I would guess because corporate doesn't want the risk) so I could see a decrease in number for a while as they go under and brands like Yum! try to take their stalls and put their version of a \"bar\" in place. Which will probably be a lame impersonation of the types of bars I described where you have to be seated and the bar prioritizes churning tables.\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to make a case for these to be open during the active pandemic, just pointing out an industry that may be very different coming out.",

I think they said something on the lines of that while the handshake will never disappear as a whole, people will simply overall be less likely to give one not just due to the awkwardness/hygienic reasons but simply because our behaviour would adjust to other means of greeting one another. That totally makes sense but I think it is interesting.",

October rolls around, there's always that one friend who would eat chalk and say it's good, who has them out in a bowl for company. I know it's gonna taste like wax and chalk had sex in a room while being watched by a furiously masturbating bag of cheap confectioner's sugar that has been cut with corn starch and 9 months later, this pretty looking nothing candy pops up just in time for Halloween to spit in the face of candy lovers around the globe. I know this. But I think \"Maybe they finally made it taste like something?\" Nope. Same stale waxy La Croix of sugar tasting piece of crap, likely recycled from last year. But I do it. I do it every damn year. How could they make something so aesthetically pleasing taste so goddamn awful? Ppl be fearing the wrong shit on Halloween. Fear candy corn, the Ted Bundy of candy.",

Well you know when you're a kid and when you lose a tooth, you're always using your tongue to lick the spot of where your new tooth is coming in because it's a foreign experience. Well it turned out that I thought the taste of olives tasted like my gums right after a tooth was pulled and I decided that I hated raw olives. \n\nStarted getting into olives again about a decade ago, and honestly it's like 50/50 from the first olive that I will either go \"oh this is why I hate olives\" or \"I never knew why I hated olives in the first place! These are awesome!\"\n\nSo depending on my mood, I really love raw olives or still hate them. \n\nNow black licorice, that shit can go get fucked six ways from Sunday.\n\nAnd Canadian Bacon and pineapple pizza, I will defend that style to my dying breath. It's got the perfect contrast between sweet and tarty of the pineapple with the salty umami flavor of the Canadian Bacon. Extra points if you add jalapenos. Then it's a fucking party in your mouth.",

It was larger and more powerful than the first Death Star. Like the first Death Star, the Death Star II's long-term purpose was to terrorize planets and star systems in league with the Rebel Alliance through the use of its planet-destroying superlaser. However, the Death Star II also served another purpose: luring the Rebels into a battle that would, the Empire hoped, destroy them once and for all. Though designed to be very similar in appearance and function to the first Death Star, the second Death Star improved on its predecessor's design by incorporating millions of millimeter-sized heat-dispersion tubes in place of the two-meter-wide thermal exhaust port exploited by the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Yavin.\n\nSecretly constructed in orbit around the forest moon of Endor, the Death Star II was larger than its 160-kilometer-wide predecessor and was constructed using more efficient methods. Positioned in synchronous orbit above Endor, the battle station was protected by a deflector shield projected by a ground-based shield generator. With the superlaser being the main priority, the weapon was completed by 4 ABY while the rest of the superstructure was still under construction. After the Empire secretly leaked the location of the \"incomplete\" second Death Star to Bothan spies working for the Rebellion, the Alliance Fleet arrived at Endor and were shocked to find the superlaser fully operational. In the ensuing battle, Rebel ground forces managed to destroy the shield generator protecting the Death Star, allowing Rebel starships to infiltrate the battle station's reactor core and destroy the station. Combined with the deaths of Emperor Sheev Palpatine and his apprentice, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, the destruction of the second Death Star was a significant defeat for the Empire. Within a year, the fractured Empire formally surrendered to the Rebellion's recently introduced government, the New Republic.",

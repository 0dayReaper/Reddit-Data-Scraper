Even if you assume each lounge visit saves you $15 in overpriced fast food, after the Uber and airline credits ($200 each), you would need to fly 20 times (or 10 round trips) with lounge visits in order to break even. And that's not factoring in visiting the lounge at your origin airport and layover airport if you have one.",

They own tons of tacticool gear bc they think it looks badass, and are probably gun nuts. A second category of HOORAH boots is the kid that just joined the military, and demands that you thank him for your service. Green as summer grass, they'll marry early for benefits and buy cars way out of their price range. That's where the word \"boot\" comes from: Just out of *boot* camp.\n\nA rarer third category is the longtime/former military member that acts self-righteous about it. Acts like he was in combat but probably did nothing of the sort. Abuses his authority at home and at work, has multiple Thin Blue Line stickers on his car. Also expects to be TYFYS'd.\n\nYou can see all three categories at r/justbootthings, most of them centered around the stupid things newbies do. It's basically a rite of passage for kids to do something stupid when they first join, that's life.",

You best believe I am maximizing how much I can pack and wearing my boots and layers on the plane. Sure it may be uncomfortable but it will literally save me hundreds of dollars in additional baggage fees.\n\nThat being said when he said \"boots\" he was referring to military guys with the mentality of someone straight out of bootcamp.",

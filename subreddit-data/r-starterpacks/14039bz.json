Something to do with putting them up to the screen on some website to activate them. And then U.B. Funkeys of course which were meant to be plugged into a PC game similar to Skylanders before Skylanders. \n\nLooking back, these were the early signs of what was to come. Before in-app purchases and DLC expansion packs, kids were instead buying physical toys that had a digital-based purpose. Now there aren't really physical aspects to a lot of stuff, I agree. Oh and  DSiWare was a precursor to modern app stores.",

I struggled for the longest time, searching up stuff like \"2000s big heads with translucent plastic underneath\" etc. It was only once I actually found one in storage and discovered they were by Mattel from its foot that I actually tracked them down. I think I just looked up \"Mattel pop off heads 2004\" or something and found some toy site with the name. Super obscure despite being made by a big company. If you just look up Mattel 2003/2004 (the period Smax toys were produced) you just find Batman stuff because that was their most popular line at the time.",

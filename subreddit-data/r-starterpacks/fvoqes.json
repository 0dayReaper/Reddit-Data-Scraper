So later on in the episode Rick's grandson Morty comes to the garage and he hears a sound, he looks around for a sound and finds a green object and a disembodied voice tells him to flip it over, he flips over the thing and it's revealed that it's a pickle. His grandpa, the smartest guy in the fucking universe just turns himself into a fucking pickle. Funniest shit I've ever seen.",

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the subreddits nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike reddit truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Reddit \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02 And yes by the way, I DO have a reddit tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",

Good for you.\n\n\nEdit: I would like to clarify because this apparently got popular and a bit for the wrong reason: consider the wording of the meme, \"things people like to feel weirdly superior about.\" The keyword being *superior*.  You can enjoy slaving your life away if that's what you're all about.  Maybe you have a goal or a business you're starting (which I've been there; working a day job, then spending my own savings trying to get my own thing off the ground after my regular work, but sadly it failed).  But, what irks me\u2014and apparently quite a few others\u2014is holding it over other peoples' heads.  My summers usually involve going hard by coming in anytime between 2 and 6am to load trucks, and still clocking out around 3pm, but I don't feel superior to others because of it.  I talk to my friends who have stressful jobs that have them working 20-30 hours and I don't but in with the, \"oh you think you got it hard...\" BS.  I acknowledge that as long as people do what's expected of them, there is no need to feel superior that I work x many hours more than them.",

In my experience it's fallacious to think \"the company\" cares about you, but you can be in a team or organization that provides a lot of comfort that social circles typically would. My first full time job out of college was at a tech startup. It was usual to work 12-16 hours a day, but everyone was doing it, and a lot of that time included things like playing ping pong or going for drinks. Frankly it was shitty executives which eventually caused me to quit and not the working conditions or immediate coworkers.

People fucking ask if your mouthwash has alcohol in it.\n\nIt's exhausting. You never want to bring it up. If some other non-drinker at some event you're at gets outed in this way and badgered about it, you actually have to decide whether to try and help them, or just look away so you don't get dragged into it as well. \n\nHonestly if you don't really like the person that much, you just let them suffer alone. It's shitty of you to do it, and you know it, but it's really that annoying.\n\nYou get to the point where if someone asks about shit like this you pretend not to notice, and it almost always works. Usually the events are loud enough and enough is going on that they just give up if you seemed to not hear them the first 1-3 times. Sometimes there are really persistent assholes.\n\nin my experience (as a man) it's like 50x worse for women who don't drink, because somehow men tend to see this as some kind of fucking weird extension of sexual rejection, in that they're somehow rejecting intimacy by declining a drink. I get that drinking together is a storied and traditional bonding/intimacy thing, but that doesn't mean that declining a drink is declining bonding/intimacy.",

I get up at 5 am but it's because I have a long commute (yeah, I know the irony in this thread, but trust me I'm not bragging) so if I get up at 5 I can shower make coffee (black, obviously) and be out the door around 5:30 and at work by 7, leave between 3 and 4, and get back home at a reasonable hour. \n\nIt honestly sucks, I don't even mind the length of the commute, it's just having to get up that early just to beat rush hour traffic. I've loved being able to work from home every day, getting up at 7 and logging in 5 minutes later.",

Unprompted. Also loves to describe in the most detail possible every aspect of hunting and gutting animals around my desk in particular. Unprompted. \n\nAnyway. Yeah. I've never met a vegan do that, I've never done anything that fucking annoying.

Being fine with drinking an affordable beer from a large company is a crime against humanity. According to these people, you\u2019re only allowed to like beer from some obscure micro-breweries and you\u2019re apparently not a \u201creal beer drinker\u201d unless know minute details about the composition of every beer in the world. \n\n- People who hate vegetarians and vegans. Honestly, I\u2019ve almost never encountered the \u201cpreachy vegans\u201d everyone on the Internet talks about. But what I see A LOT of are people being smug about making fun of them and bragging that \u201creal men eat meat,\u201d and that sort of thing. I\u2019m not a vegetarian myself, (though I\u2019m Hindu and I do vegetarian days once a week and abstain from certain meats for religious reasons) but the whole anti-vegetarian thing on the Internet annoys me. \n\n- Movie snobs. I might enjoy a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d movie that wins a bunch of meaningless awards, but I also enjoy big blockbuster movies and have a blast watching them, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\n- Restaurant snobs. Yes, I do enjoy a small, family-owned Italian restaurant, but I also enjoy Olive Garden too. I honestly don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s \u201cthe authentic style from Italy\u201d or not, I just care about enjoying my dinner. People are allowed to enjoy small restaurants AND big chains.",

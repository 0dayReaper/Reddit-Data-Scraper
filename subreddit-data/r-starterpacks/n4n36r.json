Similarly people think of the 70\u2019s as **DISCODISCOCOCAINEBEEGEES** when that also wasn\u2019t until 76.\n\neventually your beloved childhood decade becomes a caricature and costume day and even though you can describe the big difference between a 2002 bro and a 2005 bro it doesn\u2019t really matter unfortunately",

It was kind of their attempt at like a modern folk-protest album, in response to 9/11, GW Bush, the war in Iraq, etc. It's different than their earlier music but understandable given the times. Post-9/11 changed a lot of people. It was uncomfortable and weird. You see the same thing with Blink-182, and I don't think it's a coincidence a lot of pop-rock / pop-punk got more emo at the time.",

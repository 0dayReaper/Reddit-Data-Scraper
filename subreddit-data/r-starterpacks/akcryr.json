There are some astounding restaurants near where I live in the US that I just can't afford all the time, but the one thing I haven't been able to find here is a place that makes prosciutto and pecorino sandwiches as good as I found everywhere in Italy. There's even an italian sandwich shop around here I went to and it was good but not quite the same. I feel like we might have different regulations on how prosciutto is produced because its just different somehow. I would do horrible things for just one more of those sandwiches from this little shop in Florence",

Fancy restaurants that serve a couple of Italian dishes might, but the manpower required to make 20 gallons of red sauce a day from fresh tomatoes is insane.\n\nAlso it leads to very inconsistent results because the tomatoes you get from suppliers will be varying degrees of ripe. Using canned tomatoes mean you get tomatoes that were picked and preserved at the peak of freshness instead of being picked green and shipped in from a few thousand miles away over a period of weeks.\n\nI think most professional chefs will agree that using canned tomatoes for red sauce is going to be better than trying to make due with out-of-season \"fresh\" tomatoes from your local grocer.",

It's all fuckin Chicago style you gotta eat with a knife and fork, no foldover slices within 200 miles.  Thin crust with the consistency of a Saltine. Feels bad man.\n\nEverytime I go back home to visit I drive and bring an empty cooler with me solely to fill up with food to bring back home. Freeze them cheesesteaks up, vacuum seal them, months later heat up just as good as they were made. Man do I want a fuckin cheesesteak now. Goddamnit!",

The worse the quality of the napkin, the better chance you have of getting a pizza worth eating. The best pizza comes from places that have those napkins made out of rice paper that barely do anything except for become see-through from all the grease dripping off the delicious pizza. Any Pizzeria that has decent, usable napkins on the table is probably going to be trash and a waste of your money.\n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk!\n",

Got red white checker tables and even has the wood Italian dude. \n\nBut they're good as hell. \n\nCool fun fact is that I was looking through old recipes that we're handed down to me from my grandparents who were from Italy. \n\nOne of the recipes was from like 1920 and was cut out of an old Italian society news paper that was local to my area because Italians back in the day used to be super communal. The recipes name was the name of the owners special sauce decades before they ever made a restaurant. \n\nSo it's cool to know the family was popular for making great dishes 100 years ago and still going strong today. \n\nEdit: just looked at their photos on Google and they even got the fucking chairs lolol.",

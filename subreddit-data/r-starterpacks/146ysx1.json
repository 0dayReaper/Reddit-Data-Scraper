Stops and looks around the room. His eyes get fixated on a random piece of decoration out of place. He finds there either a key or a box with major plot objects. Leaves the house and heads for another country to uncover the truth (the country is either a wealthy European one or a very poor one in SA, Africa or Asia). Cuts to montage of him walking through a village (he's the only white guy and everyone looks at him).",

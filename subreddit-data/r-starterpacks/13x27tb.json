It was derived from traditional work songs and ballads outcrying about the cruelty of their situation. Bluegrass has its roots in the European settlers that heard the jazz style and applied it to their own traditional string music, and it only ever culminated around the 1930s, whereas jazz was brought about much sooner. It has many different genres, but the fundamental has remained since the late 19th century, with some big name tunes that reinforce the essence of jazz being Work Song, Moaning, and Haitian Fight Song, all personal favorites from some granddaddies of blues and swing.",

You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my \\[f\\]irst post, be gentle.\n\nEdit: This blew up. RIP my inbox.\n\nEdit2: thanks for the gold kind stranger",

Every goddamn day it's the same trash over and over again. The same mass protests on r/pics, r/news, and others. The same boring, stupid one liners against boomers and anti-vaxxers on r/murderedbywords. The same forced, borderline creepy, fake \"happy\" shit on r/wholesomememes, and so on and so forth. I use the popular, default subs as an example, but even the subs I used to like have become like this. \n\nReddit has always been repetitive, but I used to almost always find SOMETHING amusing everytime I browsed it. Now I can't even remember the last time I actually saw anything interesting here.",

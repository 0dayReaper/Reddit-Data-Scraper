The white people are reportedly attorneys. \n\nA lot of people are debating on the legality. Here's how the comment chain goes:\n\n&gt; Isn't this illegal?\n\n&gt; Yes its \"brandishing\" showing a weapon in an angry/threatening way\n\n&gt; But there are exceptions for doing it on your property!\n\n&gt; The sidewalk isn't their property!\n\n&gt; Well this is a private community, so the HOA owns the sidewalk, so in a way they own the sidewalk\n\n&gt; That doesn't make any sense!\n\n&gt; I don't make the laws, I'm saying what the law says!\n\n&gt; The law doesn't say that!\n\nI have no idea what the law does/doesn't say, but if they haven't been arrested at this point (and I don't think they have) I doubt they will be",

The mob broke down a gate which included this signage, and then bypassed another sign with this message. They were all trespassing on their property and the couple claim that the mob was making threats to them. The man was (poorly) exercising his 2nd amendment rights by not intentionally pointing his rifle at anyone that hadn't directly threatened him. The woman may be charged with assault as she was pointing her gun at people intentionally. In the video you cannot see or hear anyone threaten her but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. If it did happen she should not be found guilty of assault as its within her rights to do what she did if she was threatened. Them being attorneys I would wager on the side that they know their rights and it probably happened. \n\nThe reason why the mob was there is because the mayor doxxed someone for reasons I can't remember, but I can't imagine doxing people is a good play on the mayor regardless.",

The idea was that you could use micro-flexing of the pectoral muscle for minor adjustments to the aim when shooting from the chest like this. Coincidentally, this was also when chest-passing was at an all-time high in the NBA for the same reason. So he could be in his 50s-60s.\n\nThis practice was ended when women began enlisting in the infantry in greater numbers. With them milkers in the way, this sort of pectoral control couldn't be assumed anymore and it was dropped from field manuals as late as 1992. Though some argue that it really fell out of favor because of the rise of mantits among Air Force enlistees.",

Truth is in modern manufacturing the \"quality of a colt\" doesn't really stand up anymore, they are pretty much all high quality firearms at this point, (excepting of course shit like hi-point and other super cheap manufacturers) so when you can get just as good as quality as another for hundreds cheaper, why wouldn't you?\n\nAt least S&amp;W makes some kind of \"budget\" lines, but fuck they are so overpriced still on a lot of things. like damn near 1000$ for standard no frills 6\" .357mag. Yeah I'll just buy the ruger thanks.",

Like you can trust a mob that has been doing nothing but breaking shit, looting, tearing down everything to just walk past a nice house without doing any damage. BLM has become a joke and they're causing more and more ppl to hate blacks. It's the exact same thing that happened with feminism - when the extremist psychos take over a movement, it's never good for anyone. Most black ppl hate these BLMers too. And since Trump is promising to crack down on these trouble makers, it's actually going to help him get even more votes this time around.",

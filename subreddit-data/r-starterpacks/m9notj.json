In my experience in Kiev there are many lovely sunny summer days when people are out sunbathing along Dnepr. This is more than you can say for Scotland at least!\n\nI think this impression of eastern Europe as somewhere gray and dismal is more indicative of American attitudes toward eastern Europe, residual poor sentiments from the Cold War, it is they who make the movies lol",

Like when they show New York they make sure to have yellow cabs or yelling assholes.\n\nedit: Just realized you were talking about India specifically. They almost always have warmer tones in hot climates so the audience can \"feel\" the heat, as well as telling the audience they have changed settings.",

It is really well done, and doesn\u2019t simply focus on western art history. Even if art history isn\u2019t your thing, it\u2019s a great watch.",

The only people that talks Spanish correctly in that show are: Juan Bolsa, the ladies in the laundry (but they were nervous as fuck and laughing, it was shitty performance) and the doctor that treats Gus Fring and Mike after getting shot in Mexico",

So what are you expecting the casting director in Los Angeles in 2006-2007 to do? Find people who are fluent in specific dialects of Spanish, who also speak English, who are (very good) professional actors who can get to a casting call in a specific location in Los Angeles, and are willing to work in New Mexico? All for the 5% of the time when the characters are speaking Spanish. When probably literally 85% of the audience speaks no Spanish and wouldn't notice the difference if one character was speaking Italian.\n\nThe show was not a documentary. You can sort of complain about the look and the houses being off, but it was a show first produced in 2006 by AMC. They did not have an unlimited budget, and much of the personnel were  people Vince Gilligan worked with on The X-Files. (The popular Spanish language soap opera.) It's astounding it was as good as it is, considering there was like one producer out of fifteen who may have been Spanish.",

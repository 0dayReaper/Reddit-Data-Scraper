Unless if you think that a tiny room with an oversized furniture of some pseudo Baroque style, molding made of  styrofoam and stretch ceiling are of any good taste.  Hehe and don't forget huge ads on the outside about some hair dresser, massage or a loan agency. At least some socialist blocks can have a specific charm for someone into photography.",

Big deal!  I see fire in the fireplace all the time!\"\n\nUs Canadians are guilty of this too.  Texans get a couple inches of snow and are freezing to death and crashing their cars everywhere.  Idiot Canadians laugh at them.  But the smart people know that Texans don't have insulated homes or snow tires.  And more importantly that Texas isn't supposed to get that much snow, and it's a sign that something unusual is happening.",

What those yearly rainfall averages don\u2019t tell you is that all the rain happens in like one continuous stretch of 5-6 months. The other half of the year, there is next to no rainfall whatsoever. That\u2019s why the Pac NW has a \u201cfire season\u201d around August and September; by that point it hasn\u2019t rained in literally months and so everything is bone dry, and so it only takes one little spark for an entire section of forest to go up in flames. Also, winters might be colder there but during the summer temps regularly get into the 90\u2019s and sometimes even break over 100\u00b0F",

They\u2019d burn more slowly and less intensely, lower temperature, leave the topsoil and some large trees intact. The fact that we stopped doing that in the northern parts of the Canadian provinces in the last 100 years or so, when we banned the native people from continuing, is a big contributor to why our wildfires now are always so intense and terrible. You look at old photos of Banff or the Northern Alberta boreal forest from 100 years ago, it\u2019s almost unrecognizable. There was grassland at High Prairie  and Grande Prairie (almost like that\u2019s why they were called that!). Areas that used to be patchy grassland, shrubland, and forests of mixed age is now uniform dense mature forest with lots of dead wood, and it burns hot.",

We hope they get the fires under control and that the loss of property or life is minimal. However, we don\u2019t normally see smoke like this ever. So, we\u2019re sorry for talking about it eh?",

And I find it really upsetting and weird.\n\nIt\u2019s probably got lots of women who complain about legitimate issues and things that need addressing but the most popular posts I keep seeing are ones where they just go on a killing spree of shit talking about men. And I don\u2019t mean for justifiable reasons. If a guy is being a creep, yeah that thread exists for a reason. But then I see in the comments people just being unreasonable and obnoxious.\n\nThe biggest example was the one where the woman was in a car accident and the entire thread spent blaming the auto industry for ignoring smaller shorter women and putting too much emphasis on men in crash tests, when objectively OP in the thread was sitting too close to the wheel instead of properly adjusting it. And the thread was too busy blaming men and engineers and the auto industry over user error.\n\nAgain, I know from the top posts of all time this isn\u2019t the norm but I do for some reason see it pop up more often recently for some reason.",

I lurk there every once in a while because some of the posts are so absurd that the seem like shitposts, and some are unintentionally hilarious \n\nMy favorite post was from a woman who complained about an Uber Eats delivery man. It was during COVID so he set the food in the driveway instead of handing it to the OP. The delivery driver told OP that he\u2019d include her feet in the picture they take to confirm delivery to show that an actual person received it. She was creeped out and inferred the delivery driver had a foot fetish and took the picture to add it to his spank bank\n\nI thought it was a shitpost so asked if she was being serious and I was banned from posting on the sub shortly after, so I guess that answered my question.",

Who the fuck believes that? I'd wager there's a damn good reason why she isn't getting offers.\n\nSays husband would like for her to buy him out of their house so he can leave her the house and disappear, then says husband doesn't want her to work so she'll be dependent on him and not leave? So hubby wants her gone, but no wait, he actually doesn't?\n\nSays she can't support her children. Mentions hubby has over a million dollar life insurance and hints that she wishes \"something\" would happen. Brags about setting up all his retirement accounts which he has no access to. Describes him as controlling, lazy, unmotivated, dumb, etc, yet he owns a house, is the sole provider, and apparently has the financial means to have a million dollar life insurance policy, 401K and IRA and is seemingly comfortable with the wife controlling all of it? Yea, that makes total sense.\n\nLook, hubby sounds shitty according to her, but she seems pretty fucking crazy as well, yet the top comment is praising her and telling her nothing is her fault.",

Also, the iihs only says the closer you are to the wheel, the greater your chance of injury. So... short people should need to spend extra time and or money to get a car that has move able pedals in the US? I say the US, because of our obsession with huge vehicles. If they don't want airbag deployment to be thier fault of course. Because I have a tiny car and still sit a foot up from my husband who's a foot taller. So it's my fault if something happens to me when the airbag deploys? Is it because I didn't have enough money for a new fancy car? That's my fault too.\n In general, safety is compromised for short people the same way it is for lefthanded people. Like seat belts go across my neck no matter how far back I sit. So I get a clip for the belt, but that is objectively less safe than the manufacturers design. I'm as cautious as I can afford, but if anything happens to me, it's still my fault. \nI find that saying short people really helps the idea, because it includes men. People are more likely to believe something that includes them. And it's easy to grumble \"women just sit too close\" because you don't have to be part of the problem or the solution. Passing blame is easy. But there is concrete data showing that women are far more often injured and killed in crashes, than men are in similar crashes. We've known this, and have been studying it for 60 years with very little change in safety standards. Do you know how infuriating it is when someone says \"I see all these products we make are killing you more often, but we aren't going to change anything just to try to keep half of you alive\" https://ohiotiger.com/blog/women-at-greater-risk-of-injury-in-car-accidents/#:~:text=It's%20no%20secret%20that%20women,back%20at%20least%2060%20years.",

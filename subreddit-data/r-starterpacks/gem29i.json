You know how there are some very specific comma rules that teachers will try to drill into their students? Yeah, those rules can easily be cardinal sins in other languages. I would love to learn how to use commas correctly in all the languages I know, but it's a lost cause for me. (See that comma in my last sentence? I suspect that it might be wrong in English, but it feels right in other languages (there it was again!)).",

Sure you could just step on the rocks and let it stab you and build up, but that's flawed. When you're used to it you can walk across gravel and stuff by shifting your feet and weight so that while you're still standing on rough stuff, you aren't putting enough pressure on it to hurt. You'll see country boys walking around barefoot everywhere and there's an elegance to it that is great.\n\nAnother excellent level of walking most people don't experience is walking on your toes. When people run a they essentially just contact the ground with the tip of their feet (from the tip of the toes to about the ball of the foot), turning their ankle into another joint working like suspension in a car. If you practice it you can walk around like that normally and comfortably. One it's great for your calves, and also pretty enjoyable. In fact many people who have issues with high impact walking would benefit greatly from this.\n\nI recommend people try walking like either of these, it's a great change of pace and it's not like you have anything better to do in quarantine.",

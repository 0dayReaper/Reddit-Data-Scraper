CRAZY!!\" Like really ham it up, make a \"beard rememberance video\" for when the goal gets met, maybe live stream the shaving. Bonus: if its an obtainable amount he can just donate whatever money's still needed at the end. Publicity, Charity, Getting to Shave. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nE- You. Guys. It was so fun talking with you yesterday and getting updoots and awards! Haven't heard from OP but hopefully we'll be seeing the guy's beard shave going viral this year!\n\nI *did* talk to u/PigsCanFly2day who did a charity shave in June for Children's Cancer! He wasn't able to hit his goal, but people can still [donate to the organization right here](https://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/mypage/1072560/2020/donors#content)! \nTake a look if you're feeling altruistic!",

I've seriously seen guys with the most disgusting hairs and shitty clothes walk around with beards that look like they were carved out of wood by a master carpenter and then oiled with the finest linseed oil. Like what on earth are they thinking?",

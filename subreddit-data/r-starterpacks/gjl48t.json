Obviously less so for a mostly decayed one but it's a fantasy already.",

You'd think the question was \"what has a 9.1 on IMDB that should really be a 10.0\". It's like people here can't handle the notion their own favorites are not *universal* favorites.\n\nThe answer to \"overrated\" is usually just circlejerking about the awfulness of popular media. \"The Big Bang Theory! DAE hate BBT? Bazinga! Laugh track makes me wanna rip my genitals off!!\"",

It\u2019s a human invention based on some arbitrary thing\u2014in this case the rotation of the Earth. So what we call \u201ctime\u201d is simply the experience of some sort of change. Ergo, it\u2019s an arbitrary construct of our perception.",

If you look at the most recent definition of 1 second, cesium-133 can vibrate before and after humanity exists.\n\nBased on this fact I conclude that time is not manmade. It is not an arbitrary phenomenon.\n\n1 second is arbitrary, however, because 1/(24\u00d760\u00d760) and 9192631770 is.",

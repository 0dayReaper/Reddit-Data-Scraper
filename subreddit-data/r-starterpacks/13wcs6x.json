In any case, John Hughes was ahead of the curve in a way, because he liked to use songs by British groups that were yet to break out in the US (The Psychedelic Furs, Spandau Ballet, Kate Bush) but did so soon after because of the impact of his films. Finally, early 80's films like Fast Times at Ridgemont High used a few 70's holdovers too (Jackson Browne, the Cars, Cheap Trick and so on).",

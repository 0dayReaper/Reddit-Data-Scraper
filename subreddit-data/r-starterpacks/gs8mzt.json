It had gotten cold so they\u2019d lent him a big puffy jacket which he remembers smelled awful like moth balls and was too big, adult sized. He\u2019d fallen asleep in the car and as I carried him inside, his father had switched the tv on and it happened to be playing the chest busting scene in Alien. Now day to day that\u2019s not a particularly horrific scene, but it must have scared the shit out of that poor half asleep boy because he still remembers it.",

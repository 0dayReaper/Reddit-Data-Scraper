I want you to put it in second gear and hit as many potholes as you can.\"\n\nWith that, Marianne spit in her hand, grabbed his willy, and hit the gas.\n\nThe meth wagon barreled down the road, hitting every bump and pothole they could.\n\nIn the back, Jesse Pinkman was trying to make a fresh batch of meth.\n\n\"Fuck yeah, this batch is going to be dop\u2026.\"\n\nSuddenly, the meth wagon hit a giant pothole, causing Jesse to drop and break one of his beakers.\n\n\"Yo, slow it down BITCH!\" he yelled.\n\nMarianne, currently off her meds, drove the meth wagon right into a giant termite mound.\n\nThe accident caused Nigel's pecker to break in half since Marriane was gripping it tighter than the jaws of life.\n\nNigel, ever the rugged outdoorsman, ejaculated so hard that he actually created a new termite mound in place of the one they just destroyed.\n\n\"Oh Marianne\" he cooed, \"that was smashing\".\n\nMarianne, miserable in her marriage replied \"You know what's not smashing? Your giant Jew nose and uncircumcised cock.\"\n\nNigel replied, \"Oh, you're a frisky bird, aren't you?\"\n\nMarianne rolled her eyes and screamed \"Everyone out of the bus NOW!\"\n\nAll of the other Thornberry's (Eliza, Debbie, Donnie, and Darwin) awoke, a little confused from last night's wild bender with Jesse.\n\n\"Where the fuck are we?\" Debbie moaned, as she awoke from her stupor.\n\n\"We probably crashed in the middle of the Savanna because poor daddy needed a tuggie.\" Eliza said.\n\n\"I fucking hate my life and my family\" Debbie exclaimed as she slit her wrist ever so gently.\n\nDebbie had a knack for being an emo little bitch.\n\n\"So dad,\" Eliza asked as they made their way out of the broken down meth wagon \"what are we doing here?\"\n\n\"Well deary,\" Nigel said Britishly \"we're out here hoping to catch a glimpse of the dung beetle's genitalia for our latest documentary.\"\n\nAlthough Nigel was fresh out of cream, the thought of filming a \"dong-beetle\" made his whitey tighties get a little more white, tight, and wet.\n\nAs the gang packed up their things to find the dung beetle, Jesse stayed behind to \"guard\" the wagon (cook drugs).\n\nJesse, still pissed about his broken beaker and hating the Thornberry's in general, decided he was going to make a bad batch of drugs for them.\n\nTo do this, Jesse decided he would piss in his latest concoction he was making for the family.\n\nJesse thought his bodily fluids were radioactive and pissing in their drugs would be enough to get rid of them.\n\nUnfortunately, he was right on those assumptions, and his urine caught an open flame from a burner and caused an explosion that took out himself and the wagon.\n\nThe gang was not very far away when the explosion happened and they raced back as fast as they could to see what had happened.\n\nNigel and Marianne were shocked at the sight of the smoldering meth van; especially since they were planning on blowing up the van with their children in it next week to claim their life insurance policies.\n\nThey played it cool, however, and took a mental note to come up with a new strategy.\n\nThe smoldering van made the kids extremely pissed because their \"escape fund\" (money that could be used to escape from their bat shit parents), which totaled $47 was gone.\n\nEliza began to break down as she remembered what she had to do for that money\u2026\n\nEliza's memory flashed back to a gorilla plowing her from behind while holding on to her pigtails for better balance and thrust.\n\nYes, Eliza whored herself to animals for money.\n\nThe gang regrouped, said goodbye to their van and Jesse's crispy corpse, then took off on foot...",

Hell, even if they're not anthropomorphic, Nala's bedroom eyes in The Lion King were front and center. In the late 90s/early 2000s, 3D Sonic games started getting released with characters like Rogue and Amy. In the mid 2000s, World of Warcraft came out with dem Tauren tiddies and Pokemon probably knew what was happening when they put Lucario in a lot of the promotional material for Diamond and Pearl and Lopunny as a less prominent, but still present Pokemon in the same gen (I personally don't count Gardevoir as furry bait, but you could probably make an argument there too). Later generations of both introduced stuff like Worgen tiddies, Inceneroar and Delphox. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr- these companies know what they're doing.",

I haven't had any furry clients yet, but one of the other student clinicians did and since I'm nerdy she asked me about it.

Not exactly academic, but finding legitimate academic articles on furry culture is difficult.",

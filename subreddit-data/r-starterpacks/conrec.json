Its hard enough to commit suicide normally in prison since they take any objects that you could use to kill yourself away from you like shoe laces or any sharp objects. Its obviously not impossible without said devices but its a lot harder. With the only objects around of some use being the metal bars, the clothes you wear, or the walls as tools. So not impossible but in the case of the bars or walls the guards would probably hear something and seeing a person without their clothes on would be suspicious if they were spending the time to make a rope. \n\nNext up he had already attempted it before while \nIn prison which put him on suicide watch. He got taken off this watch obviously earlier than he should of been. This also reads as suspicious to people.\n\nThis meme points out that it looks like someone paid the prison or asked for a favor to take him off the suicide watch and to not check on him appropriately.\n\nEdit: forgot to add that it definitely appears to be a suicide, but some believe it may have been assisted.

                    "comment": "Jeff Epstein, a billionaire who no one really knows (including Forbes) how he made his billions, was already caught once down in Florida because of how many underage girls were entering and leaving his mansion and were paid to give him massages and then get naked and he would molest and rape them got caught once again trafficking underage girls recently. The facts of his first case are now all a matter of public record. It\u2019s a fact he raped dozens of girls and there were over a hundred suspected to be victims.\n\nHe was let off amazingly easy the first time, only serving an 18 month sentence where instead of going to prison (which should have been for life if he was tried federally, but he was only tried at the Florida state level for inexplicable reasons) like normal, he was allowed to serve his sentence in a private wing of a jail and leave for up to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week to go to his office on work release. In the documents he signed as a sexual predator, it even says that sex predators are not allowed to participate in work release. Guess that doesn\u2019t apply to billionaires.\n\nDue to his connections and ties to world leaders, it is an extremely high profile case. Today he was found dead from suicide in his jail cell after he had already attempted suicide and was placed on suicide watch. Apparently, whoever was in charge of the decision thought, \u201cah, he\u2019s probably good now, let\u2019s take him off suicide watch.\u201d Surprise, surprise he was found dead.\n\nBecause of those connections and implications on powerful people, many people think he was either outright killed or encourage or enabled to kill himself to prevent testifying and to prevent his case from proceeding.\n\nIt\u2019s suspected he has a lot of dirt on powerful people. One of the girls from the first case has spoken about how Epstein has cameras all over his house and would tell her about certain proclivities of powerful men.",

In places like Kyiv, for example, there is a sense of relative safety, and the war may seem distant occasionally. However, there are moments when the war's impact becomes evident, jolting people awake with explosions that disrupt their sleep throughout the night. \nDuring this winter, shellings caused severe damage to the energy infrastructure, resulting in households having electricity available for only about 50% of the time. It impacted all, including civilians making basic things much harder. Despite these challenges, people persist in carrying on with their lives, making plans for the future, and demonstrating resilience in the face of adversity.",

Totally ignoring that at that time, men were drafted in at age 20 to train, then when it came time to mobilize for war... Art school wouldn't have saved him from fighting in the war. They also then want to talk about how great he was despite the fact that by Vienna's standards for entry, he was mediocre at best.

Hopefully these types grow out of that stage if they actually do go on to study history and learn that history is more than regurgitating facts about WW2.

So, I spent hours combing through 90+ year old newspapers and speeches. It was super interesting to be able to examine all that stuff first hand. I got pretty desensitized to his disgusting ideology though. I was shocked at how similar his rhetoric and themes are to that of some modern politicians, pundits, and online conspiracy theorists. Based on what I gathered about his personality and style, I couldn't help but draw parallels to the strong man populist leaders we have seen seizing power around the world today.",

You have an ancient Egyptian pharaoh's bust. Well, they were the commander-in-chief for their armies, and their civilization was foundational for the development of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations later on. You also have what appears to be an ancient Roman bust. I'd say it's valuable to know about ancient Rome's warfare, as it is an essential part of that statuary's very existence.  \n\n\nIt's great to understand the various nuances of cultures from the past and present from all over the planet, but neglecting their relationships with other parts of the globe or the significance of conflict is to perceive humanity through a narrow lens that neglects important knowledge of who we were then and who we are now.",

Here are a few of my personal favorites:\n\n1) The Nazis relied heavily on \"wonderweapons\" which were basically huge-ass weapons meant to be propaganda pieces. If you've ever heard someone reference the huge Nazi tank on rails with naval guns, that's one of them. The problem with wonderweapons is that the state could only make like 1 or 2, while the Soviets in comparison were cranking out tanks out like sausages. Both had technical difficulties, but while the Soviets could replace a broken tanks with like 20 more, that giant tank that shoots giant artillery is just fucked.\n\n2)Nazi intel was fucking dreadful. In the months leading up to D-Day, the Allies tricked the German high command into thinking the invasion was going to be at Calais. They did this by building a fake base in England consisting of literal inflatable tanks and trucks. They also planted fake intel with what would have been top-secret D-Day plans on a fake corpse and just had it wash up on the shore France. The Nazis were tricked with fucking Looney Toons tactics.\n\n3)During D-Day, the Germans weren't able to mount a cohesive defense because Hitler liked to sleep in until noon and no one wanted to wake him up.\n\nEDIT: As u/medam pointed out, the corpse from 2) was real and was about a fake invasion of Sardinia.

They spent so much time innovating, always racing for the next big gun/tank/plane.  They had a new tank coming almost every year, each time thinking this would be the end-all-be-all.\n\nThe US and Soviets innovated, too, but they also kept a \"workhorse\" tank design.  The M4 Sherman was continually upgraded throughout the war, giving it more armor, better engines/tracks, and a better anti-tank gun (more on that later).  Likewise, the early T-34 was a mediocre tank, but fast forward 5 years and it's now got an 85mm gun, better armor, etc.\n\nMore than that, the US and Soviets designed tanks that matched the war THEY needed to fight: Germans designed \"good\" tanks, but not the ones for their fight.\n\n* The US had an untouchable titan of an industry base (good luck bombing it!).  The Sherman was thus designed to be mass-producible, and a \"modular\" design that made upgrades easier to manage.  The legend is that any Sherman they lost in France had its replacement on the beach within 24 hours.\n\n* The USSR had a massive population but a \"primitive\" industry for their time.  Their tanks were designed to be as simple to make as possible.  The early T-34s had a top lifetime of 9 months if they never got attacked: the mere act of driving would shake and misalign the gun sights, bearings, etc.  Heck, they kept free-floating track pins in place with a bump on the chassis: it would hammer the pin back in place.  But that didn't matter to an army where the average soldier's life was measured in minutes, hours if they're lucky. \n\n* Germany had a smaller army, but they had the edge in tactical prowess (at least in the beginning).  They also had a severe dependency for resources: steel from Sweden, oil from Romania, etc. They need a mechanized army to be effective, but they can't afford to squander these limited resources.  Spending all their intelligence on making bigger, heavier, more resource-intensive tanks was a waste.  They should have focused on optimizing resource usage: the StuG is probably one of their most \"cost-effective\" vehicles.\n\nAnd now a tangent, back to that Sherman with a \"better\" 76mm gun.  Most wehraboo-style \"historians\" would assume the 76mm gun is obviously better than the 75mm since it had superior anti-tank capability, but the opposite was true.  Most tankers preferred the 75mm gun, because a Sherman actually engaging a panzer was quite rare.  Germany was extremely short on tanks, and US doctrine was to let tank destroyers handle them, not the Shermans.  Those were supposed to support infantry, shelling defenses and such.",

It's a principle of industry that whatever means you use to measure success becomes a goal itself. The best example of this was German plane manufacturing. They measured quotas is number of planes built per week, which seems fine on the surface, but in reality led to plants devoting all their resources to building planes and not other important things, such as spare parts. This led to German planes cannibalizing each other for parts. British factories, on the other hand, devoted 75% of their output to actual planes and 25% for replacement parts.",

The false dichotomy of humanities-history-good/military-history-bad is part of the absolutism you're speaking against.\n\nI agree that a Eurocentric history focus can go a little overboard sometimes, particularly in the US where the educational system treats it like the only history that matters. It's important but not at the expense of the rest of the world. People that focus on Nordic or Germanic history often give me a scary altright vibe. \n\nAlso /r/MapsWithoutNZ would like a word.",

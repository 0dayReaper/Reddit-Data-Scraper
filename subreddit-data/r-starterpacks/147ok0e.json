This was during the holiday season, and he joked about \u201cwelcoming everyone aboard as they travel to be closer to family, or as far away from them as possible like me.\u201d \n\nIt got even better/worse when the plane landed and told everyone \u201cto grab your bag and exit as quickly as possible, just like my parents told me to do on my 18th birthday.\u201d \n\nI still obviously think about him sometimes.",

Not bring it in the cabin. \n\nOr try to fit in someones slightly too big carry on, only to find the fullsize backpacking bag, 3 times too big, taking up a whole component.\n\nIt got there because the the air company had moved peoples seating around, and people where arguing and showing tickets for the same seat. So staff was distracted.\n\nI wanted to offer the poor guy closest to me a candy bar but I had eaten it while watching the drama. :(",

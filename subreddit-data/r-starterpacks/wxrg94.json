Rare steak is safe because all of the pathogens inside of the meat are pathogens that are already inside of you; anything that could cause you to get sick is on the outer surface of the meat and dies as the meat is cooked.\n\nSo when you scramble up all of the surface meat and internal meat into a patty, all of the nasty shit gets to the center of your patty, and if the center doesn't reach X\u00b0C then you haven't killed whatever bacteria is there.\n\nGranted, if everything is super clean it's not that big of a deal, but you're kinda trusting a butcher and whoever ground the meat to be above board with basically all aspects of their shop (Imean, safety guidelines exist for a reason) \n\nTho I'm pretty sure there's a German or Polish dish that's literally just minced meat (pork or beef) on toast and it's fine because their health &amp; safety standards are substantially higher than other parts of the world, because a bunch of their people eat raw meat.\n\nIt's not like a rare patty is immediately unsafe, it's just less safe than it could be. (Especially when you consider that basically no other type of burger has this problem as the thinner patty actually cooks all the way though in a reasonable time)",

One reason it's done because it's easier and faster to swap gloves when you sticky sauces on them than it is to try and go and wash your hands every few minutes. Unlike with other food stuff which is easy to wipe off or rinse off cook BBQ sauce is hard to get off. A big one is hot BBQ sauce is like napalm, thankfully the gloves are heat tolerant enough to handle it. So if some that is too hot sticks to you just whip the glove off minimizing time of contact. \n\n\nHowever you will now see them being used by some dude making salads. Hell i saw someone using them to make cocktails.\n\n\nAs for while black was common originally in the BBQ sectors. Well no one wants blue because that bring up the association with medical shit. Also black, orange etc where common with the gloves used with auto section. So why make supply lines complicated if you can use the same base nitrile with both, you make make sure one production line is good save. Think model T.",

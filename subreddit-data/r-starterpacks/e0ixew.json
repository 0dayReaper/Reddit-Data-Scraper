There are so so so so many people in the world, you really can\u2019t generalize a generation.\n\nThe term \"young people\" was replaced by \"millennials\" by the older generation so the older people could make general statements about how everything that is wrong in society is because of \"young people\" or \"millennials\". Then \"millenials\" was quickly transformed into a derogatory term by the older people. I say this as an \"old millennial\" who hangs out with people older than me that started to use \"millennial\" as a derogatory term for \"all young people\" and I had to correct them with a long rant about how they are using \"millennials\" as a derogatory term and if they do think \"millennials\"  are bad then it's their generations fault for raising \"millennials\" so poorly. Now, instead of a long rant when they start talking about millenials, I can just say \"ok boomer\" and they instantly get the point.",

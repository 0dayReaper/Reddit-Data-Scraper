Then he says (insert feature) good, *compares with iphone* in other also important areas.\n\nMarques just gets really boring and long for giving some standard info and not going too in depth, he says the numbers of thing and how thing feels good to use, also things that should take about 20 seconds to say usually take him like 2 mins to say, i just kind of want to sleep.\n\nThe last of the really prominent reviewers is linus, wich is by far the best of them because he fully knows his shit and when he is experimenting he clearly states it, the only slight issue is that sometimes he goes pretty hardcore into some segments to a point that is kind of unnecessary but its always appreciated to be over informed rather than under.\n\nMost other smaller independent reviewers sometimes shill products super hard because of a sponsorship that they really need, they can test things pretty weakly or they are on a marques\u00b2 type of boring.",

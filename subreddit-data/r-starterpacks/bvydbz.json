Its just that you will use six black pencils before you even come close to shortening any other color, so its easy to notice that it is broken in many places.\n\nThat sixth, unnatural green that doesnt look like any vegetation type is equally fucked. Youve been carrying it in your back which you flail around and thrown unceremoniously ten times a day. But you'll never use it, so its harder to notice that it is broken",

Additive is how light creates colors, so when you subtract all of them you get black and when you add them you get white. Subtracive is how pigments make color (when drawing or painting or using dyes you're using pigments) so when you add them all you get black and when you subtract them all you get white. With light you can add blue and red to black (nothing) to get purple. With pigment you subtract red from black to get green, as what is left is blue and yellow.\n\nSo yeah, there's no such thing as black *light* as it is the absence of color. But in pigments, black is all of the colors being represented. This is also why there's people who (incorrectly) debate what are primary colors. Red, Yellow, and Blue are the Subtractive Primary Colors. Red, Blue, and Green are the Additive Primary Colors, which is what is used in TVs and monitors. There were TVs made by Sharp that were RGBY but the yellow addition wasn't really noticeable. The main problem TVs have are showing blacks, because it's hard to light parts of the screen while completely dimming others.\n\nedit: /u/midaspaw pointed out I had them backwards, so I fixed it. I think.",

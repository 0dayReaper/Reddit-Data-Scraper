Payment is expected immediately. If you cannot pay, the debtor collection authority of Node 03 will be notified of your outstanding balance and will put you under arrest and your current classification of \u201cassociate citizenship\u201d may be reduced to just \u201ccitizen\u201d or citizenship may be removed entirely as well as any rights afforded to you in the Internodal Government such as the right to a Tier 2 artificial lawyer or lower for example. As a courtesy afforded to associate citizens we have decided to waive the communication transaction fee of 50.00 credits. \n\nHave a nice day!",

You may choose to sell the rights to your body on a timed basis to a Debtor Collection Authority affiliate such as the EA-Activision Conglomerate for paying citizens to jockey your body. With your current credit salary and the estimated hourly base rate for you bodily appearance we estimate a complete debt and interest repayment in 33 years. If you choose to accept these conditions you will be required to be body jockeyed for at least 6 hours outside of your current employment for a total of 6 days a week. Any bodily harm and lasting medical issues that results from being body jockeyed will be paid to the company in temporary ownership of you at the time of injury and they may choose to heal you or not, at that moment, without repercussion. The company that owns you may terminate the contract at any notice, for any reason at all, including but not limited to medical expenses to repair their property exceeding fair value.\n\nIf these terms are acceptable we encourage you to reply within two hours from this message being delivered. Failure to reply with choosing to opt into the program or with a credit payment totaling in the amount previously stated will result in the repercussions stated in our previous notice to you.\n\nHave a nice day!",

I honestly think it's at the point where people won't be able to retire, and then what? There aren't enough Walmart greeter jobs to go around, so now you've got people working until their bodies give out and a whole generation fighting over disability payments until they die.

It's set in America in roughly the 2100s and is basically a satire on how technology and consumerism affects society. It is also a kind-of romance story, which detracts from it imo cause I don't like romance, but it's not a typical romance plot so that makes up for it a bit.",

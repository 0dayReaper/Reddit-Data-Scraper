There are a lot of homeless near my area and their plight is quite heartbreaking. They also somewhat hide their tents and so forth. I don't think they should be hurt or judged but not sure if I would need permission since they are in a public area, just like people walking around. Not sure what I think about that. Okay, I will consider this point of view. Interesting.\n\nMaybe just make sure there are no people in the picture, that might be more okay. It's not to get them hurt, just document how they are living, maybe to be seen 40 years from now. Since people feel very raw about this locally, and it's not to stir things up or even necessarily to \"solve\" it.",

But sadly I think this issue has moved far beyond what the average person can do, especially in major metropolitan areas.

Relying of auto mode is the bane of photography teachers.\n\nNo one kid is going to turn in nothing but fence photos. Sure, on a long enough timeline you\u2019re going to see the same shit over and over. On a shorter timeline you\u2019ll see them more often if you\u2019re a shit teacher not challenging your kids.\n\nPhotography, like anything with practice is 98% shit and 2% decisive moments. It\u2019s the 2% we live for - capturing someone\u2019s moment, what the old school house used to look like, the abandoned lot that looked magical during golden hour, but is now filled by cheaply built yet overpriced condos.

She'd just bought a film camera and wanted to know how to use it so I sat down with her and started explaining the exposure triangle. Yeah... it didn't go down well. Despite the myriad of information I gave her she basically left with \"ISO 800 ish, 1/60 and it'll probably work in normal lighting maybe don't know also developing film is expensive and takes too long to go from shot to instagram\".\n\nAnd that was that, obsession over.",

A photographer is going to work on the composition more when they know they're going to be spending time developing it later.  \n\nIt's also likely that they're shooting manually, so they're going to have to learn the workings of their camera and lenses.",

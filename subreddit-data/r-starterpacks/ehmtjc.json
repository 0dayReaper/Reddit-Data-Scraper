It doesn't need to be macaroni (or anything) stuffed. It doesn't have to be so tall I can't take a bite. I'm also not sure why they were always well-done regardless of how I ordered it. \n\nI'm sure some would argue that the double-stack style is overplayed, but it's nearly impossible to beat when executed well. Best burgers in my city go for about $12 (with fries). Anything more and you've certainly overpaid, even if the average plate price at that restaurant is $100.",

The bottom line for a company is that it just takes longer to make since there's more sitting time. So, if you're making ales and lagers you have to have a larger lead time to get your lagers ready in advance of whatever season/event it's during. This takes up extra space in your facility for everything from fermentation to staging for distribution. Obviously people still do it, but when you're a smaller company like a start-up microbrew (or now \"nanobrewery\") you don't have the time, money, manpower or facilities to do something like that.

Cities in the southeastern US (south of North Carolina, east of New Mexico, north of Florida generally) tend to be hard on the eyes, and Texas cities are often the worst of the bunch.  Lots of visual pollution, high-rise signs, billboards, franchise architecture, etc.   Go more than a few miles/kilometers past 6th Street, and you might as well be in suburban Dallas.\n\n* In my experience, Austin residents are way more hardcore about their favorite niche hobbies or interests than residents of most other American cities.  Austin is full of people whose identity is entirely defined by being into road cycling, indie music, or whatever. So, so many Lance Armstrong wannabes and people who reinforce the \"I was into X before it they were cool\" stereotypes.\n\n* Cedar fever.  The worst allergy in existence, behind Celiac disease and anything that forces someone to carry an EpiPen.  Shots, steroid nasal sprays, and OTC and prescription allergy meds barely make a dent in it.\n\n* The Space Age retro aesthetic is annoyingly big, big, BIG.  Austin's version of \"put a bird on it\" is \"put it on a Googie-style or kidney-shaped sign.\"",

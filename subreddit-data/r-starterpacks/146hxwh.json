                                    "comment": "True. I should have said \"nominated for an Oscar.\" Because usually when someone says \"Oscar bait,\" they're talking about meeting criteria that other movies have established as tried and true for appealing to the academy. So it probably happens often--but not always--that movies will at least be nominated for awards based on those criteria. Like you said, they don't have to win to be Oscar bait. But presumably they should be nominated on an often-enough occasion that we can recognize those patterns.\n\nWe can all think of typical Oscar bait criteria too. Big Budget Movies about war that involve heroism and the soldier that had the letter to mail to his mom that he passes off before he dies. Movies that offer a biography on a historical figure whilst showing the good and the bad. Movies that praise Hollywood and its peculiar history and well-known names. \n\nNot all of those that try at this, will be recognized with a nomination. But enough do. And within the last 5 years, this holds true:\n\n1917 got tons of Oscar nominations.\n\nBlonde got an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe Fablemans also had plenty of nominations.\n\nSo what's another movie in the past decade that set precedent for winning an Oscar nomination that fits OP's criteria? \n\nSurely you're aware of one and you weren't just pedantically correcting me without considering the context of the conversation in the thread, right? Because if you do, we'd all love to know.",

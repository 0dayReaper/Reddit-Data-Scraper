The chinese cigs looked badass too. We'd invite them out to party but they only came out once with us, they mostly liked to keep to each other. I can understand tho considering the cultural barriers. Cool af dudes though.",

Or they will show me something on their phone to make, like something they saw on instagram. Maybe they get an almond croissant, chocolate croissant, or double smoked bacon with it. Also always very sweet and friendly, always told me how they liked my makeup. They usually have a nice manicure as well.",

It won't look good on any Asian either without stylizing and different hair types really don't have the same outcomes with the same products. I wouldn't be able to pull this off because I've curly hair and cutting it short leaves a Teletubby antenna that won't go down although I've facial structure that I'd easily pass with if I was transgender. This cut, even on Asians will look like a bowlcut if you don't use paste. Asian people who have frizzy hair can't really do this cut. It does take a pretty feminine face, but Asian men aren't inherently more feminine looking than Caucasians on average. Plenty have the Hank Hill and Peter Griffin genes too. Presentation and beauty ideals just are very different.",

So I'm half Korean(American) and I got Korean Americans friends from school, all over south east Asia. \n\nWe love to get together run Bangkok and sit in at outdoor barseats right at a large adult entertainment section. The foot traffic is crazy. \n\nWe love to just basically guess where all the Asian tourists are from. 15 years ago, it was easy to spot the Koreans. They had the most America influence while making it their own. North face?  stussy?  Hair perm?  Korean. Wearing Saucony or Brooks or Under armor shoes?  Korean. Wearing any MLB cap?  Korean. \n\nThese days, it's much harder because the fashion and the sense is more intermingled. Sure, the facial features say a bit but lot everything. Good fun. \n\nIt also seems that interracial groups are rare in lots of the world. I'm very blessed that I was raised in an area where it's possible. \n\nWe will be in Bangkok with my roommate from Iowa, my friend from Italy, my friend from Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Peru. It's like a fake commercial but we are all old friends. So many instances and so many examples of racism (many different countries. For example, my Sri Lankan friend who looks like Raj aristocracy - 6'5 and looks like a rich mans son - will get stopped at the hotel entrance by secyrity in Jordan and told that the servants entrance is behind as I get greeted warmly as we walk in together).",

To me it always seems like one of those places that doesn't really get talked about besides when someone is quoting field of dreams or something. Cool that you are friends with all types of people. Sucks that your friend group had to deal with racism sometimes though.",

He grew to love Korean food but I also loved his early fascination with me prepping seafood.  Like shucking oysters and peeli g heads off shrimp or cutting up sea urchins.  Midwest peeps are special. \n\nI remember when he said \"Why do so many Americans from immigrant groups marry within that group\". I said, dude- a major factor for what you proposed to your wife was because she was a midwest girl!",

England and Scotland ceased to be independent sovereign states and were then, and now, considered separate states within the union. The title of the monarch changed accordingly and the titles of King or Queen of England and Scotland passed into history. Anne was Queen of England and Scotland when the act was passed and her title was changed to Queen of Great Britain.\n\nAlso if she's ever in trouble she's the Queen of Canada, so we can just lop off her head and store it at the North Pole, like Walt Disney.",

The only soup I'd known prior was Campbells chicken noodle, and those Chunky commercials with NFL players and their moms. \n\nWe'd tap the top of that cheese layer with a 17th century bone spoon, slurp swapping those wet bread chunks between our gums. We'd guzzle ratatouille broth off each other's bodies, bullion cubes and all. The next day I'd be licking those crock edgings for burnt dried cheese scraps. \n\nBut like the most passionate affairs, eventually things settle out. I started to think she liked the soup more than me. I once couldn't satisfy her sexually, after a few too many underage beers, and she gave me an exasperated sigh and abruptly retreated to the bathroom, bowl in hand, to finish what I had started. \n\nI'd see the signs. Random spoons in her purse. Late night phone calls to French boulangeries.  Soggy croutons in her pussy. She told me she was aging them for a friend, but I knew better. \n\nThe last straw was when she shouted out the wrong name in bed-- \"gruyere\", she moaned. I knew it was over then and there.",

I didn't break up with you over the soup in bed, even though it was super annoying - especially because you filled that bowl to the brim every time and I had to change the sheets every night because you ALWAYS spilled without fail. No, we broke up because we are two very different people. We just don't work well together. You don't even get along with my parents, and you were one of the few they actually liked. Our relationship ran its course, and it's time to move on. You have a lot of great qualities that will make someone happy, but I'm not that person. You're smart, handsome, driven, and sorta funny. Like, not especially funny, but you used to get a chuckle out of me every once in a while. It just didn't work out between us, and I don't want to give it another chance. I know this hurts. It's painful for both of us, but I never wanted anything other than for both of us to be happy. It took three years for me to realize I wasn't.\n\nAgain, it wasn't about the soup. Kinda weird that you came to that conclusion, but I wish nothing but the best for you. I realize that's such a clich\u00e9, but what part of our time together wasn't a clich\u00e9?\n\nI'm sorry I had to do this publicly, but I'm glad I can give everyone some closure. Please let this go, find yourself, and the right woman for you will come along.\n\nGoodbye, Colin. I have no regrets about our time together.",

Indeed I do give my upmost effort to educate myself and better my understanding and thus comprehension of such an unusual yet widely used modern foreign language, but alas my efforts have so far encountered nothing but limited success. The combinations of both Latin and Germanic lexis have so far proved to be a serious tribulation for my progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we continue, it is of upmost importance that I state my location of residence as to clarify why my linguistic skills are so substandard. I reside in the sovereign state recognised by the United Nations, and thus the international diplomatic sphere, as \"The French Republic\", colloquially our title is simplified to just \"France\" for ease of use purposes. Now you may be considering the stereotype that us Frenchmen are reluctant to undertake the studying of languages, and indeed you are in fact correct, the opposite is true of our neighbours to the North East of Alsace and Lorraine, called Germans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you are probably considering the, lets face it, obvious possibility that English isn't my first Language. This is also a correct statement, quite predictably, my mother tongue is infact in \"French\" language, though I can also competently converse in the languages known in the Anglo sphere as: \"German\", \"Mandarin\", \"Korean\", \"Latin\", \"Old Norse\", \"Hanajii\" and \"Proto-Luganian Celtic\"  The latter of which I take great pride in understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever,  I do not share such linguistic capabilities and expansive lexicon in my understanding of  \"English\", so therefore I must once again profusely apologise for my such poor use of  the vocabulary, Grammar and other such linguistic factors that one must consider in this context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMerci et bon journ\u00e9e!",

In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it\u2019s a peach of cake.\n\nSorry, I just had to.",

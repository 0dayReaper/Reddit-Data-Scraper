The only time I can think of we used gloves was when you cut yourself and the plaster was not cutting it then you took glove as well to not let your blood into the food. \n\nOther instance we took glove or well some plastic sack on our hands was during service when you were touching HOT dumplings.\n\nGloves are not needed and if you are using them all the time then either you cant wash your hands or you have some skin condition so you must wear gloves which in this case I understand.",

It's real easy to touch the raw chicken and then the salad when your hands are gloved. \n\nI use those same black gloves when working with dead stinky things because they are typically a bit thicker, less likely to tear, and sit higher up the wrist, which is important when you don't want death stink on your hands (which is never, you never want it on your hands).",

Did I or anyone else put on gloves to add the cold side garnishes to every hot meal that got on a plate with tongs? Fuck no. \n\nIt does tend to be more enforced in chain places to the point they just make you wear them all the time. I\u2019m not just talking about fast food, but chain steakhouses and other \u201cnice\u201d places too.

The worst being I could never get into a normal sleep pattern; just as I was starting to adjust sleeping during the day and working at night, I'd be off work for a week, and slowly go back to sleeping at night and being up during the day. I had to do all my usual errands on my weeks off because I was too tired on the on-weeks.",

By then you're usually an hour and a half into it and you can't just let all that time and effort go to waste. Your dick will hurt so bad you wont want to touch it the next day anyway.\n\nSo you muster up your courage and every ounce of strength you have left, give a sincere apology to your dick for what's about to happen, and jerk so hard the bolts holding in the armrests on your chair snap off. All that just for a couple seconds of pleasure, then a couple of minutes praying you heart doesn't explode as you stiffen up and try to breathe \"normally\".\n\nIf you're lucky you might just pass out right then and there, dick in hand with a little splooge on the side. You wake up again, ashamed, and ready for more cocaine.",

I imagine a consistent coke habit diminishes the strength of your teeth (especially if you rubbed it on your gums/rolled a cig in it etc) irreparably. Also anytime I look in the mirror at my teeth to floss I get a nice reminder of my past because I'm missing a chunk of my front tooth from grinding/anxious nail biting. Glad I stopped when I did.",

The rest who had the inclination went with meth.",

Plus the way the media portrayed(s?) meth probably played a role as well, I imagine. People who were well off/famous did coke a majority of times so I suppose I was trying to emulate the lavish party lifestyle I knew i couldnt attain. I grew into adolescense with a very visual \"egomaniac + inferiority complex\" if that makes sense. I came from a very middle class family, we were never exactly 'well off' but I always had an inherent desire to dabble in the lifestyle for any of the myriad of reasons anybody could muster, anyhow. My abuse kicked into high gear for the last time when I got a warehouse job that happened to employ my old pot dealer from high school, who apparently decided to become a connoisseur of all things drugs. Dude was my plug for everything and anything, and I went on a sojourn trying to self destruct I guess. Moneys easy to come by if you're on that sort of death mission, in my experience, even without a history of wealth.\n\nEnded up making basically 600 bucks a week, realized it was the first time in my life I really had money to spend on anything I wanted, and I could build up plenty of nasty habits in the process.\n\nIts really a good day to not be dead. Sorry for rambling. I dont get to talk like this to many people, and this whole post just rustled up alot",

A friend of mine from high school had to break the news to his fiancee that Brick would be a *terrible* song to play at their wedding, and why (it's literally the story of the singer and his high school girlfriend going to a clinic to get an abortion).",

Conversations are wild, meaningful and fun. Listening to music is fun, doing nothing is fun, and therefore all of that is memorable.\n\nWhy be bored at home when you can be bored at home having fun?",

Anorgasmia is more common while high. The in ability to actually finish. That's also a side effect of some antidepressants. It sucks. At first it can be fun because you can get right to the edge just pushing that boundary for what feels like eternity. It feels amazing, then it can go different ways. You can become numb horny as hell but you have beat the nerve endings into submission and they give up. It can become an ache you want to finish and you can't, that usually comes with it becoming so sensitive it actually becomes uncomfortable to continue. It's a mix of pleasure and overstimulation pain. The cold air on your bellend actually hurts, the fabric of your underwear hurts, the pulse of your blood through it hurts. Shit sucks. So glad I'm off antidepressants. Because it was either I was horny but just couldn't get the motivation up to have sex or when I did it ended up like this. However a positive note is if you can finish after being held at the edge that long it's fucking powerful. Full body feels it. Waves of buzzing pleasure, after shocks across the body of weird twitches that send static like shocks through the body but of pleasure. Some other weird but good sensations that I've only experienced after that. Usually followed by muscle cramps from just going to town as long as you can. Oh God just remembering the hand and forearm cramps from nights when the wife worked bring back phantom pains. Lol yeah 3/10 don't recommend.",

One dude pulls out 5 grams and dumps it on the counter and tells everyone to help themselves. You look at your girl and though you both have never done it before you decide it's 2018 and why the fuck not now? So you both rail each nostril and realize this is what life is about. So you stay up all night slamming lines and bud lite, then around 4 am you run out of beer so you crack open the bottle of rancid wine from 3 months back and choke it down and head back to the counter for \"just a couple more\". The 3 guests you invited leave and say \"keep what's left, have fun.\" So you and your lady decide that since you're alone it's time to Pablo a couple lines off her ass and see what sex on coke is about. But once you do a couple lines off her ass cheeks she wants to do one off your dick. But you're so jazzed up that you unintentionally keep flexing your weiner muscle and messing up the line. So she gets mad and locks herself in the bathroom with the rest of the coke. Which makes you mad that she's in there partying without you so you go smoke a bowl. She comes out 30 minutes later wearing a bodysuit like it's 1974. She apologizes and you both go bump a line and go out on the porch and have sex on the porch but the neighbors are waking up for work and call the cops. The cops knock on the door and you're super paranoid and act like you're not home but Meat Loaf is blaring in the living room and the cops just knock louder. So you have no choice but to answer the door. The cops say they had reports of lewd activity and question you for a few minutes and end up leaving after telling you to not do that again. Now your adrenaline is pumping and you need to do a line to get back to baseline. It's the last bit, either 6 small ones or 2 monsters. You and your girl decide to go big. It's nearly 9 am. You're finally out of coke and you start realizing it. So you try to lay down and you can hear your blood pressure in your ears. Your nose is numb but also hurts. You can't breath through it laying on your back. So you just lay there tossing and turning until 2pm when you're so exhausted and miserable you finally pass out.",

The brain wants it, badly.  You can *logically* know that taking it will end up with consequences, but you don't make decisions *logically*, you make them emotionally, often in the heat of the moment. \n\nSo it goes with addiction. \n\nEvery addict often partakes in full and complete knowledge that doing so will ultimately make them much less happy, but they cannot stop because they are not in control of the emotional system of the brain that makes decisions for them.",

Having done it pretty regularly the benefits you get from the first couple of times disappear, all it'll do is keep you awake and give you some energy to dance but that's it. The intervals become smaller and the bumps bigger and it'll stop working.\n\nGlad it's not in my- or most of my friend's lifes anymore, next up is smoking which is surely going to be far harder to quit as its ingrained into my every day life\n\nEdit: spelling",

I\u2019m about to turn 30 this month, and in my past I suffered from alcoholism 5 years ago but was able to become sober with the help of some friends. I still drink but its about once a month or less. I go to most shows and raves sober and when I do drink once a month, its 2 beers max since my tolerance is so low. A lot of my rave fam does coke and I stay far away from it because the stories that I am reading here are reminiscent of how I see people around me on coke at raves can be. The first time I tried coke I was 22 in Vegas, and we had about 8 girls join us from Marquee, the way 6 of them fiended over coke has been forever impressed on my subconscious... I knew at that moment that I never wanted to be like that. If I hadn\u2019t seen that I may be addicted to coke - that was the only deterrent I needed to not continue doing it and reading people\u2019s stories here only makes me feel grateful for not being addicted to it.",

I was an addict for about 6 years.\n\n Finally I had enough of feeling that way and I was getting older and it was getting less cool and more sad. Kicked the habit and I'm never going back.\n\n Reading all these stories that remind me of how shitty it was is very therapeutic and really cements that I'm never going down that path again.",

FUCK YOU\" he would deny it every time and his base would lap it up and say it's a liberal hoax and Trump never shot anyone and that it was someone else in his administration that did it. When people are nervous about COVID Trump never offered words of encouragement, he didn't try to reassure the country we would make it through stronger than before, He called the Reporter nasty for asking the question, He downplays *everything* related to it and called his non-handling of it a Democrat Hoax.",

Basically someone would post ludicrous conservative propaganda and when it got removed 30% of the sub would throw a shitfit. Then when they removed ludicrous liberal propaganda the other 70% would also throw a shitfit.  \n  \nNear the end of moderation people would either post articles saying \"Trump created Covid to kill minorities\" or \"Democrats created Covid to discredit Trump\". Any time this retarded shit was removed people would complain about \"muh freedom of speech\" which proves neither side has any idea what thier rights are.  \n  \nEventually the last mod said \"Fuck it you retards want freedom of speech fine, you can post anything without moderation unless it's illegal\".  So 24 hours later the only thing on the subs frontpage was porn everything else could not get nearly the same amount of upvotes.  \n  \nEventually Warhammer nerds started posting memes saying \"ignore the porn upvote Warhammer\" and the sub became a Warhammer meme sub for a few weeks, eventually the JoJo anime got a respectable foothold and had thier memes everywhere as well. A few days ago Star Wars memes started overtaking every other meme and now it's mostly star wars memes.",

You know, like many Americans-sorry, United Statesains, how crass of me-I live in a perpetual state of excitement at the prospect of my humble, rinkydink township being graced by one who was fortunate enough to have been born on that most glorious of continents, Europe. Alas, my excitement is often paired with fear. Not the usual bits of fear that we United Statesians are so familiar with, like being shot on the way to McDonalds, being shot on the way to the hospital after being shot on the way to McDonalds, or the hospital McDonalds being out of Medical Grade McRibs. No, i'm talking about the fear that I might run into a European without realizing it, and thus, not give them their much deserved greeting of vigorous oral stimulation, interrupted only by sobbing apologies for not being a good boy like Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it doesn't have to be this way! You see, our finest, most book-learnd'd scientists have compiled a guide to spotting one of our glorious overlords. Here's an excerpt. If you have some trouble with any of the bigger words, please mash your phone's keypad with your palm, or if you prefer, dialing wand, for information as to how to sue the publishers for making your think-think go ow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany Europeans can be identified with their lack of bandoleer, bulletproof vest, and, most incomprehensibly, a gun. You may be thinking, \"Sure, maybe they don't have a GUN, but they've got a .22 with them somewhere, right?\" Shockingly, our researchers have discovered that Europeans are completely comfortable traveling, shopping, and even going to the bathroom without a ranged weapon of any kind. Theories abound as to how this is possible, with the prevailing one being that they are protected from danger by a sense of self righteousness that it can literally stop bullets in midair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother quick way is to note if the individual in question is dangerously underweight. Scientists from the Guy Fieri Institute of Flavor have determined that a European is somehow able to survive for extended periods of time at a shockingly low caloric intake of less than 7500 kCal per day. Research is ongoing as to if this is related to their ability to walk all the way from the frozen pizza aisle to the pre-made pizza aisle without the assistance of a mobility scooter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone neglect to tip you? Before you sue them, make sure you consider the possibility that they may be European. Europeans often will not tip in restaurants,bars, hotels, barbershops, pet shops, hardware stores, Gamestop, airports, or maternity wards. This is not due to ignorance, but instead is borne of the natural benevolence of our overlords. You see, unlike us, they are intelligent enough to understand that tipping is a barbaric and foolish practice. They see the plight of the tipped worker, knowing that they depend on those tips for their income, and they show their solidarity with the worker and displeasure with our custom we are too stupid to change....by refusing to tip them. You see, they understand that their money is better spent at the nearest gas station to their hotel, which is where they will form all of their opinions on our cuisine.",

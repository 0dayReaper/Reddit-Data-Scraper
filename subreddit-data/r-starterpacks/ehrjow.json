The only way it could be less subtle is if it just cut to the creator talking to the viewer directly.",

That ending monologue by the therapist fucking tore him apart and broke down the 'lol funny random' facade of Pickle Rick. \n\nBut like 2 years later I still see \"I turned myself into a pickle!\" Stuff from the fans all the time. Completely missed the point haha.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/IUHECxS6IEU) is the speech if you're interested and don't mind spoilers.",

I wouldn't want to have a friend like him in real life. Sexist and disrespectful to women. There's a reason he was going through a character development but the writers went back pedal. Seriously guys, just because someone is funny/good looking doesn't mean he should threat women like disposable trash\".\n\nThen the expected comments came to him expectedly:\n\nYou don't know a thing about Barney.\nHow dare you. He's a good guy that suffers.\nYet another SJW trash propaganda. Unsubscribed.\nYou didn't watch the show.\nBarney's cool, deal with it.\nWhy do you insert politics into a show? You ain't gonna get laid by hating a fictional character moron.\nSo what if women are treated like whores? They deserve it if so they wish it.\n\nThose are mostly the comments I found that day. I couldn't believe it. Those are your average Joe's. I'm not gonna act as if I was an innocent Joe who never saw or wanted a sexualized woman but for God's sake, I had never cheated or lied to a woman for the purpose of having sex. Those attitudes makes you an egotistical asshole. Barney is ok with it but that's totally not ok for anyone around you. The show and even him acknowledged, however the final episode turned everything back into status quo and pissed me off.",

I knew a few in school and they were so incredibly depressing. \n\nPeople who see the movie, don't read the book, and get the message that evil is created and cannot be destroyed. They take the movie as confirmation that their worst impulses are not their fault but the result of their own mistreatment by the world or certain figures. That their worst impulses are fine to follow because they are simply their nature and it is our job to provide a playground for their ego. \n\nSPOILER: For anyone who hasn't read the book, it ends literally with the opposite point. The movie ends with an unapologetic Alex being released back into the wild with a head pat, giving the idea that evil is evil and will be evil - maybe even that we would be wrong to attempt to change someone's nature. The book has like one more scene than the movie, in which Alex sees a kid and decides there can be a point to existing and not being a complete shit.",

He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.There is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is. \n\nThe dude's funny, and a lot of his rants are very much true (Especially his \"Wrong generation\" rant), but he's not meant to be taken as gospel.",

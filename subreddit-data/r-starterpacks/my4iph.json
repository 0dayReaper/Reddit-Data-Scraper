But you probably won't do that either, will you? You'll read the messages from the homescreen and pretend you're so busy that they'll remain unread for weeks. You'll break the silence by sending a meme no person over 18 cares about. Forget people. Buy our camera so you can look like a cute dog through Snapchat instead.'*",

So rumors says that iphone 13 series will still have mini version while the series after won't. Which makes sense as the companies plan out devices years ahead, and after seeing appalling sales they decided to discontinue.\n\nThat really sucks, as I am also a fan of smaller phones. When 13 mini comes out, I'll definitely grab it as currently I am still rocking XS which is in perfect condition and no reason to change except size.",

Not enough to badly impact screen real estate, but enough to vastly increase the number of typos I made on its keyboard.\n\nI never did get used to typing on that X, so when the first X-style plus model dropped, I went for it. Typing immediately improved.\n\nI dunno how I ever typed on that 4, or the 3GS that proceeded it.",

                            "comment": "The graphics API usually isn't the limiting factor. Sure, newer APIs can bring big performance improvements on compatible hardware but a game written in Unity with standard Unity shaders will compile to use OpenGL ES 3 with (mostly) the same produces image as if it were compiled to use Vulkan, the difference will be in performance. And since most game developers use engines like Unity and Unreal I think that the reason that mobile games don't look better is mostly because looking better = more computation = worse battery life and a player can only make out so much detail on a 6\" screen that's half-covered by thumbs.\n\nIn any case, Genshin Impact is an example of a good-looking mobile game and on high-end phones it can look nearly identical to the desktop version despite the fact that it (most likely) runs on OpenGL ES 3.",

I believe the app Apollo says it's going to cost them 20 million dollars a year, just to pay for the data.  And, even if they do pay it they still will get access to all of the data they need. Reddit is blocking not safe for work content for third-party apps.   \n  \n if you want to continue to access all of reddit, you have to use the official app or use a desktop. If you haven't been on the official app or website in a while, the design is sad, and the ads are extremely invasive and is pushing ad designs that look like posts in general poor designing. So even the desktop version called Old Reddit won't be able to work without paying. They're a screenshot available on various post regarding this topic that shows just how poor it is compared to the third party app.",

Unfortunately though, this time we won't be saved by some mass exodus. Because of the maturity of the internet and again, the death grip that Enshittification has on the whole of the modern internet, we'll never again see the bloom of a new platform like we did 15-20 years ago. Personally, once Reddit has been thoroughly Enshittened, I'm done with social media as a whole.",

Single. Post. I was \"only\" deleting the spam and off-topic posts, while not even touching the posts that was 100% fine and on-topic. When I appealed, the admins response was basically \"don't let your queue fill up again; you won't get the sub back a second time\". Its dumb as fuck, and seems to be applied to subs arbitrarily, but they may have gotten a warning, and just had to spend a couple of hours going through their queue making decisions about every single post and report that was in there, even if it was years old and key context was no longer around. They're not going to see it was a repost for a 9yo post. They're just going to see you reporting an on-topic post, and that they need to do *something* with your old report to appease the even more fickle reddit admins.",

It's so weird because it's a top upvoted comment, and I'm reading it, and it's word for word everything I posted.  Usually with all the formatting and links stripped out.\n\nAnd those are only the ones I happen to see!  How often is this happening otherwise?",

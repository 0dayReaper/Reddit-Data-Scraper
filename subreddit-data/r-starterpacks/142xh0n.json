Ain\u2019t no way that a week-long suspension will teach her the severity of her actions. What if that boy wanted kids when he grew up? Kids of his own, not some test tube or adopted baby. Well now his hopes are crushed completely. No level of pain can be rendered unto that girl that emulates it. The feeling like something\u2019s pushing its way out of your throat, and the only pain that is actually worse than it is childbirth, which men cannot experience. Being kicked in the juevos is the second worst pain you could feel. A little tap or something is not the same as being kicked with lots of force and with their shin. It makes you wanna throw your guts out and the pain doesn\u2019t just go away quickly. That boy endured that. She better hope he\u2019s homeschooled now because I dunno if he\u2019s gonna be very happy seeing her again.",

Boy... I swear to god its dangerous half the time because I've met real people who actually believe such a thing is possible. \n\nBitch I need rescuing. I'd love a rescue. 1 rescue please.",

During testing men were on average able to exert about 163% more strenght during a punching motion than the women tested. \nAdd to that, that muscles and mass in general also to a degree help in absorbing punches taken and it paints a very different picture than whats often portrayed in movies today. But still yea 100% a well aimed surprise hit to any critical area can definitely bring a much larger opponent to their knees. Theres an argument to be made for both sides here id say. \n\nSource if youd like to read more: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205132404.htm",

Matter of fact, iv never been in a street fight but ive seen a fair few go down and the winner is quite often just the guy who gets the first few hits in, especially with less experienced people, that was all guy on guy action but it just goes to prove that yea its definitely possible to beat a larger opponent if you know what youre doing",

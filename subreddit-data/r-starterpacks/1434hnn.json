And \nthere is no real sense in trying to change until the upper class puppetmasters change. We could try to force their hand, sure, since their success stems from our toil. But we are the citizens all caught on the wheel they've put us on. And if you jump off, you're in the minority and get left behind. Just look at the response to COVID. You think we could actually form a galvanized response as a society? \n\nThe ones who need to change are those fat cats reclining on mega yachts and shooting rockets into space for fun - releasing an entire person's lifetime worth of carbon emissions in the process.\n\nNothing makes sense. Nothing is fair. So just do what you want each day and hope for the best. So when the end comes, hopefully you had enough fun that it was a life well-lived, despite how fucked up our system is. \n\nWE as a species are all at fault. That is true. But don't let the honus fall on you as an individual. Practice self empathy. Tell yourself you are a perfectly rational, beautiful soul thrust onto a stupid, ugly mess of a world. Now your job is to make the most of it because your soul doesn't deserve to suffer for the sins of an entire economic system that goes well beyond you. And breathe. \n\nHope for the best.

Carefully paid it off in full as best as I could and used it sparingly. Just last year applied for Two more credit cards when my score hit \\~680. Approved for both, got a 1000 credit line on one and 1500 on the other. I was so excited to have such a huge credit line. The 1500 had (and still has) a 0% introductory APR and I've been carefully manipulating that to avoid payments and essentially use it like a 0% interest loan which has proved invaluable during this pandemic.  \n\n\nJust got my credit line increased to 3500 and was approved for another card with a 5k line and also a 0% introductory APR.   \nIts not \"much\" but knowing that I can essentially get a 0% interest loan of \\~8500 on a whim (assuming of course that I carefully pay it off) is such a relief because I never had much liquidity at all and now I feel like I have at least 15 months of breathing room.",

I'm gonna just try to respond generally to everything right here otherwise I'll be having ongoing threads for days.\n\nWhen I mention coupons, GoodRX is a fine option for a lot of things, but most expensive brand name drugs offer coupons of their own through the manufacturer website. Just try to find if your med has a website and there should be a savings/coupon link. Some require a bit of personal info, but most are active right on the spot with some fairly good savings. In addition, Blink Health is a service that offers coupon-like prices but instead of paying the pharmacy, the customer pays Blink and then Blink pays the pharmacy. \n\nAnd yes, I agree that healthcare should not require coupons. In a perfect world everyone could just get the medicine they needed for little to no charge. Yet we don't live in that world. You can cry about how liberals or conservatives are the problem, but healthcare is such a larger issue than just politics. As easy and cathartic as it is to say \"Orange Man Bad!\" or \"No thanks OBUMMER!\" the president alone doesn't magically control the drug prices. It's way more complicated than that.\n\nPharmacy is, at the end of the day, a business. It's a heartless way to look at things, but when you work in healthcare you have to face that reality every day. Looking for coupons and financial support is how we inject the human element into healthcare. No, your inhaler shouldn't cost hundreds of dollars, but it does. And I could sit here and explain why it does, or I could be productive and try to help with the cost here and now. \n\nSpeaking on inhalers specifically, we're entering a pretty remarkable time for these medications. Patents are lifting on some of the most common inhalers like Proair/Proventil/Ventolin, Advair and Symbicort, and generic version are finally coming to market. No, they're not magically going to be super cheap, that takes time, but more options for the consumer is always better.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text. If anyone has more questions a DM would be much more manageable since I won't be checking this 'high quality' thread any more than I already have. \n\nGood luck to OP and everyone else.",

They're honestly better than my health insurance at having my back. \n\nAlso, a round of applause to whoever decided to bring the Primatene Mist inhaler back to the shelves. I remember when they initially stopped making the inhalers back in I believe 2012, but still kept the tablets around. Even though those inhalers are not the same as Albuterol, and I feel super jittery and wired after a puff, it's better than being without. Seriously, I don't wish an asthma attack on my worst enemy.",

I just go by how badly it sounds like the engine wants to fucking die. It sounds like that always though so you go by speed too... if the speedometer works that day. The ac doesn't work so handcrank those windows down baby! Who needs a cigarette lighter to charge their phone anyway? What do you mean there is a loud pop when I make a left turn? Just turn the radio up on my jank speaker set up made from dvd surround sound speakers because the originals broke. Ignore that sputtering sound as I turn the radio up more. No, I don't think it has airbags. Why do you ask? Sorry about that turn, this thing never had power steering. Oh yeah, the passenger mirror was never there, it came from the factory like that so it is legal. Sure, we can legally fit a third person I have enough seatbelts but I will be hitting your junk every time I shift.\n\nI know that someday I will have to get a new car but this car is mine. That rusty pile of shit in the front yard is mine and I weirdly love it. You can fun of it but it is mine and I am unashamed that I am taller than my truck and can hardly fit inside.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for sharing your love stories. I love hearing them. I posted a picture of mine in my profile if you are curious about mine",

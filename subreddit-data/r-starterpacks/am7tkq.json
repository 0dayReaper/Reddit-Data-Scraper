After the first time he got in trouble for wearing out tires, we got an extra set of rims from a junkyard and would buy a $20 set of rear tires from the used tire shop. We would blow those things off the rims in less than a day. So much fun, although we almost turned over so many times. ",

Roger Williams and many other antinomians were banished from Plymouth Colony to the south where they settled Providence and other towns forming Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations. His ideas included Religious Freedom and the Separation of Church and State. \n\nWhen people talk about our Founding Fathers, they often forget there's 100+ years of foundations prior to 1776. Lil Rhody had progressive religiosity well before it was cool.",

I can't imagine having to deal with sharing my bedroom with someone else. No privacy at all....",

The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services based outside of the US. The campaign is operated by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM), thought to have been directed at jihadists across Pakistan, Afghanistan and other countries in the Middle East.According to CENTCOM, the US-based Facebook and Twitter networks are not targeted by the program because US laws prohibit state agencies from spreading propaganda among US citizens as according to the Smith\u2013Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. However, according to the Smith\u2013Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, dissemination of foreign propaganda to domestic audiences is expressly allowed over the Internet including social media networks. Isaac R. Porche, a researcher at the RAND Corporation, claims it would not be easy to exclude US audiences when dealing with Internet communications.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Witnessed it first hand multiple times.  Chinese students are willing to try anything but study.\" Even though it's a racist, blanket statement.   The whole discussion is riddled with blanked statements picking apart \"rich Asians.\" \n\nFor what it's worth, I've met several hard working \"rich Asians.\" One of my groupmates for my senior design class came from a wealthy family in Beijing but he drove a shit car, dressed in sweats all the time, and he always pulled his slack.  He didn't care about superficial stuff; he cared more about doing well so an American company could sponsor him to stay and work in the States.\n\nWhat if I said, \"Theft is rampant.  Witnessed it first hand multiple times.  Black people are willing to try anything but work.\". It's just as bad and disingenuous towards black people.",

Indians definitely probably get it the worse though of Asians with the tech support, poo in the loo, 711, etc stuff that's pretty blatantly racist. Now I hate all the snowflakism, and I think we should be able to jest and joke about race/religion/sex generally, the issue I have is with the blatant imbalance of what's okay or not based on the chosen minorities who actually matter. Black people and the LGBT community are far, far more vocal about the discrimation they receive, which granted has been, and still largely is very bad. But that doesn't make it okay to elevate them above Latinos, Indians, south east and east Asians, Arabs, etc.\n\n\nTrue equality is being able to make the same stupid jokes like the above starter pack about any of these, or any other, groups. This sub is literally about pointing out stereotypes. Dave Chappelle's new special (and his career, man he is great) , and South Park since it's inception, do a great job at poking fun at everybody. That's the true American spirit right there. Everything and everyone is open to parody, satire and criticism.",

I've seen those stupid r/scriptedasiangifs pop up on every obvious skit from a country that doesn't use a romantic language just because these people think that's a legitimate way to take a stab at foreign humor; the fucking shit talks about Chinese tourists being the literal bane of human existence which yeah they suck, but are they any worse than the fucking white people that go to other countries to fuck both the people and the culture of those places?; and the fucking classic listed here, people talking about the asian people who have a different sense of fashion and taste from your eggs Benedict and $15 flannels you *totally* thrifted. \n\nIt's ridiculous these people thinking just because one group doesn't lash back violently it's all of a sudden ok to throw away the principles you cling to so tightly because \"it's just a joke man\"; apparently not when it's directed at black people is it?\n\nEdit: the comments are nothing but trash that proves my point and another one. Self hating asian people also assist in this stupid narrative, and you guys are probably the saddest of the bunch. At least the other ones try to elevate their groups using stupid and immature tactics, but you guys actively try to bring down your ethnicity for your own uniquely pathetic reasons. Have fun!\n\nLast edit: some of the comments are an eye sore to read, the ones downvoted to hell specifically. The rest are great.",

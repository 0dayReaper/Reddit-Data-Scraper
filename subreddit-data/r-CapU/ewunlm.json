    "postText": " \n\nQuiz Bowl is a competition where university students compete on their knowledge of various academic subjects (history, geography, math, biology... etc)  and trivia. The game is somewhat similar to the British quiz show University Challenge. \n\nWould anyone want to form a team for CapU? \n\nIf you want more information on the issues of eligibility, rules, check out the links below.\n\n[https://acf-quizbowl.com/eligibility-rules/](https://acf-quizbowl.com/eligibility-rules/)\n\n[https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/](https://acf-quizbowl.com/gameplay-rules/)",

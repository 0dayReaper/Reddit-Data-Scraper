I had this problem as well because I did not take pre call untill last semester of high school so I didn't have a grade for it. When I got my first progress report from my math teacher I was able to summit it to the university and be accepted in to the program. It also could mean you forgot to pay your application fee. Try reaching out to the school they were  pretty good at helping me resolving the problem.",

You're gonna have access to a room of computers with autocad/ inventor etc. Most of the time I spent working in projects was in capU, specially because the group needed to work together.\n\nI only really needed my laptop in two occassions: Coding for projects in programming course at home and APSCI in the last semester because my project was quite complicated and I wanted to model at home\n\nI had friends who used laptop more for notes in class but I'm more of a notebook kinda guy",

I don't know how they are managing this during the pandemic since I graduated in spring 2020, so I would email them just to make sure.\n\nI hope you don't mind but here's a few tips:\n\nIf you do some work in autocad and inventor in cap's pc you'll be able to send to your autocad's pc but generally not the opposite. This will happen because their version of the programs is quite old, so if you do some work at home you might not be able to transfer to their pc anymore.\n\nThe silent part of the library is a great place to study and you can \"rent\" rooms too, it just takes a click on their website and it is a great private place to lunch with friends or practice presentations.\n\nGo to office hours, even if you feel like you get the assignment, instructors are super helpful most of the times they'll try hard to help you out.\n\nYou'll need a TI84 in first semester and a TI89 in the later, but they'll not allow you to use the TI89 in the first semester due to more advanced functions. You can rent a TI84 at the library and buy a TI89 later on because that's the one you'll use more in your engineering life.",

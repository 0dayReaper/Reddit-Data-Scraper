    "postText": "Hi, I want to apply to the 2022/23 motion picture arts program. As an international student it will cost quite a bit of money. I was looking at the capU residence because it\u2019s the cheapest option, and probably the only one I can afford, but I\u2019m reading a lot of bad reviews about the cafeteria and just how everything works. Can someone talk about their experience? Some people say that for that money is not worth it, but being the only option I can\u2019t do much. Thank you.",

Maybe you can check out on facebook? \n\nNorth Van is generally pretty expensive area to live, but there might be some cheaper alternatives to residence either in NV or even in Vancouver. It is fairly straight forward to get to Cap by bus. Best of luck!",

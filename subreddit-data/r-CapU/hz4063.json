The stream I want to join requires 2 first-year English courses (either \"one must be composition focused &amp; one must be literature focused\" or \"both are literature focused\"). \n\nIf you were admitted to the program, were you able to use English 100 to meet the English composition course requirement?",

[Here is the link to their webpage. ](https://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/admissions/admission-requirements/) I have chosen the path of Kinesiology (Human Kinetics at Capilano) with sciences as my electives. Having said that, choosing a degree program that interests you is important. It\u2019s a long journey and you want to be engaged and interested along the way. There is an additional webpage on UBC\u2019s MED program that outlines all the science courses that are recommended for medical school, I\u2019d recommend checking that out as well. \nBest of luck!",

They're rebranding from their racially insensitive name of \"Eskimo\" and I want to find out which of the new suggested names would you prefer, as well as gathering opinions on the rebrand decision. Thank you very much!\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GPV9Q2S](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GPV9Q2S)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I was accepted into the Bachelor of Design in Visual Communication program a while ago and was wondering if anyone could answer some questions I have about it or just give some general details about the program as it would help me make a more informed decision. Here are some questions I have. \n\n1) How is the workload like in this program? Is it manageable? Have you ever felt overwhelmed with the work load or felt that it took so much of your time that you barely got any free time? \n\n2) How are the teachers/classes like? \n\n3) Is most of the work done in class or done outside class? \n\n4) Is the work all practical or is there some theory? Are there any exams you have to write? \n\n5) How are the job prospects after graduation? \n\n6) What do you most like about this program? Any challenges you faced with it?\n\n7) Are you happy with the program? \n\nWould really appreciate a response :)",

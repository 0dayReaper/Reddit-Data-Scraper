    "postText": "Hi Cap U Students, are you looking to get volunteering experience? The time required is as little as 5 hours a week! You can even volunteer from home!\n\nI'm part of a BC based organization called OSCMS-BC. We are supporting the design, development and distribution of dozens of items that are sorely needed in BC. Our partners included UBC based design teams like UBC SOS who are making ventilators and bubble helmets to BCC3D who are delivering thousands of face shields to healthcare workers.\n\nWe already have many university students from all kinds of years and programs signed up. They are supporting technical documentation, delivery runs, translation, programming, marketing, outreach, fundraising and more! If you are interested sign up here! [https://www.oscms-bc.ca/contact-us](https://www.oscms-bc.ca/contact-us)\n\nIf you have other questions just ask!",

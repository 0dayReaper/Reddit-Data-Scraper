    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am nearing completion of my Paralegal Certificate at CapU and am considering continuing onto the Bachelor of Legal Studies on a part-time basis.  I have a few general arts credits from SFU that transferred over to Cap so I have just over 1/3 of the credits needed for the degree.  Has anyone else who has completed either the Paralegal Certificate or Diploma continued onto the degree?  If so - was it worth it and what was timing like?\n\nThanks!",

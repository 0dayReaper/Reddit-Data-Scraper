    "postText": "Hey people, wondering if you could give me insight into your school and city as I prepare my moving plans there.\n\nI'm aiming to transfer from Alberta next September for the Bachelor of Music Therapy program, and I'm wondering what insights anybody here has about that program, the school and surrounding area, the music scene, and the city overall. I'm a rock/acoustic singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, so I'd like to be out gigging sometimes, but school will be the main focus for the next three years.\n\nBeen to Van a few times over the last ten years for playing and attending shows, but haven't spent much living time there. I know a lot can change between now and September, but just trying to get a heads up. Thanks in advance.",

    "postText": "Hi hi I\u2019m not sure where to ask this but here seemed fit. Are there any Kin students who know if the program is hard to get into? I read that this year is the first year they\u2019re offering the bachelors program instead of the degree. I\u2019m just worried because Kin is such a hard program to get into for anywhere and from searching up the acceptance rate for CapU I got they have a 23% acceptance rate (which kinda scared me?) anyways thanks in advance!",

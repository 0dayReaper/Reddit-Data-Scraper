    "postText": "Hey,\n\nIf anyone is in the program, how do you find the program, and do you find it manageable to achieve a high GPA? How are the exams and grading evaluation structured?\n\nFor context, I already have a BSc degree from UBC with an average in the A- range. I'm trying to boost my GPA to apply for medical school, and while I am open to learning, the main purpose of my second degree would be to increase my GPA. As you know, it's another big investment, so I am curious about the CapU kin program with respect to the ease of getting a good GPA.\n\nThanks!",

Having said that, I have completed the first two years in the Human Kinetics program which has become the Kinesiology Bachelors program. I would say it is average in terms of difficulty. There are classes like anatomy/physiology, where the instructors do expect detailed responses on exams and getting an A isn\u2019t the easiest. My average semester in the Human Kinetics program was around a B/B+. I was taking a full course load of 5 classes per term. \n\nI just finished term 2 in my 3rd year at Cap taking filler classes waiting for the Kinesiology program to start and got an A average. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s not a breeze but if you maintained an A- at UBC, you should be fine.",

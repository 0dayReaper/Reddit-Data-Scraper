But it\u2019s always different when you\u2019re actually taking it. I was more curious if I had to take the whole time or if I could finish early etc.",

One thing I found extremely distracting was that you could hear everyone else taking the test speaking their answers. Just a heads up because I found it very awkward and distracting. Otherwise everything else was in line with the practice test. \ud83d\ude42\n\nGood luck!",

In the end where I thought I would bomb the oral/speaking based on her guidelines and criteria I ended up getting 90. So I think it\u2019s just best to go in relaxed. \ud83d\ude42",

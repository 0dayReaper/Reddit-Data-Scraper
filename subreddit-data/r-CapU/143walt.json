    "postText": "I applied for BA in Legal Studies (Paralegal). It says on the website that I must write an essay on why I want to become a Paralegal; however, it says optional on the Educational Planner.\n\nIs it mandatory, will they not accept my application until I send it, and is the program competitive? \n\nAlso, I applied a few days ago; however, I haven\u2019t heard anything from them yet. Is that because of the strike?",

I was accepted into the paralegal certificate &amp; had to submit everything that was listed as an entrance requirement, regardless of what education planner says (as that\u2019s used for processing the basics of your application). Also, took me about 6 weeks from when I applied to when I received my acceptance letter, and I\u2019d anticipate that the strike will delay that even further.",

            "comment": "Third year BA student here, yes the essay is mandatory, and yes they won\u2019t accept your application without it.\n\nThe program itself isn\u2019t competitive, but getting in is. There\u2019s less than 30 spots and they\u2019re probably already gone by now. I applied in February and it was already full then.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the strike will effect applications; I think it\u2019s instructors that are striking, but I\u2019m not sure exactly which group it is. Either way, it took them a month to respond to my application. (Though this was still during COVID)\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t use ChatGPT. Yes the essay can be annoying but using AI is plagiarism and can get you in major trouble with the university, any future employer, and the courts. At the very least, it\u2019s an automatic rejection of your application.",

My coworker (we\u2019re legal assistants) applied into the paralegal certificate rather late &amp; when she called, they were able to tell her if seats were still available so definitely give that a shot before spending the money to apply. Also be prepared to follow up on your application &amp; advocate for yourself if needed. My admissions facilitator was so incredibly difficult to deal with that someone from the school of legal studies ended up calling me to apologize &amp; clarify things.",

There are general programs that likely have a much higher acceptance rate assuming applicants meet the minimum requirements. \n\n3D animation is pretty competitive but you should focus on the strength of your own application and not a percentage. You will need to submit a portfolio by March 11. The details of what to include are on the website. \n\nYou should receive an acknowledgment letter in your personal email after you submit your application. That email will give you your Capilano ID number and instructions on how to access your Capilano email. You need to check your Capilano email for information on how and when to submit your portfolio. \n\nhttps://www.capilanou.ca/programs--courses/program-profiles/3d-animation-for-film-and-games-diploma/?&amp;tab=tab-program-admission",

Based on the website, copied below, it seems that hand drawn images are good to include. \n\nSorry this is so long:\n\nThe portfolio must consist of 15\u201324 images demonstrating your artistic and creative skills. Post only your best and most recent work. The portfolio should consist of a variety of the following types of artwork:\n\nLife Drawing: Quick sketches, gesture drawings and sustained drawings of the human figure, clothed or nude or animals in various action poses. The drawings should show accurate proportions and your ability to draw structure (the simple shapes that make up the form). Make sure these drawings show a diversity of poses and angles (i.e. More than front on or profile views). Studies of anatomy, faces, hands, etc\u2026 are good additions.\n\nProp and Location Designs: This would include drawings of objects, location designs, scenery, vehicles, architectural drawings, still life, etc...These drawings should convey an understanding of line, light and shadow, colour, design and perspective.\n\nOriginal Character Designs: This will showcase your interest in animated characters. This may include action poses, character expressions, model sheets, turnarounds and illustrations.\n\nOriginal drawings, designs, sculpture, paintings or computer graphics work:\nThese will showcase other related artistic abilities and interests. This may be a selection of artwork that best describes your personal artistic interests and influences as well as the depth of your artistic achievements and may include website design, computer graphics, 3D images, motion graphics, fine art, photography or sculpture work.\n\nTraditional and hand-drawn work should be scanned. If you don't have access to a scanner check your local library or school. In a pinch a digital camera will work, however, the quality will likely not be as good due to lighting issues (like using a flash). Photographing artwork on an overcast day without a flash will give better results.",

Last year we got our acceptances on April 1st (which made me question whether or not it was legit haha), so around April seems accurate. I know nothing is confirmed yet but all the best in your application, it'll be great to have some new additions to the film and animation crew!",

            "comment": "In 2D Animation &amp; Visual Development, we use TVPaint in first year animation because it's pretty easy and the drawing tools and process is closest to classical-on-paper animation, Photoshop in the design and layout and concept art classes, Harmony near the end of first year and a lot in 2nd year, and Storyboard Pro for storyboarding. Newsprint for life drawing and we still flip paper, at least a little.  Note: you can try out TVPaint at their website: [tvpaint.com](https://tvpaint.com) and get a trial that is full and without an end date but doesn't let you save or export your work and has a watermark.",

(Wondering cause I seen Emily Carr having this kind of setup) Do you also recommend good tools to use at home? \n\nThank you in advance! Really appreciated.",

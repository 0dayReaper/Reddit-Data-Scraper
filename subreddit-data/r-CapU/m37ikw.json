    "postText": "So I got invited for the paralegal program interview for the fall 2021 intake and I was wondering what the interview was like? Do they give you some examples of questions that they might ask? What kind of questions can I expect? I\u2019ve never done an interview for school before so I\u2019m quite nervous. \n\nThanks!",

I also got some questions like what is the difference between a legal assistant and a paralegal which i probably got wrong. Make sure you have questions prepared! That is all I really remember but it was not as nerve-wracking as i thought it would be! You\u2019ll be fine :)",

I had accepted an offer to attend Capilano University for the Fall of 2023 a few weeks ago but today, I see that my CapU email is not working and that I can no longer access the student portal.

Registration week isn\u2019t until July so I\u2019m sure we will have access by then. If you are really worried you could call the school to see what\u2019s going on, they\u2019re all really nice. I hope this helps:)",

I keep getting e-mails saying the orientation is mandatory (and I'm actually missing it as a write this!!), but how mandatory is it? Like, what's gunna happen now that I've missed it, and do I miss anything actually important? Thanks!",

The constant emails saying it\u2019s mandatory were making me concerned but some of my friends that attended said it\u2019s really not worth going, especially if you\u2019re a transfer student.",

They really don\u2019t care if you can or can\u2019t come, but obviously it would be great if everyone could. Don\u2019t worry if you missed it.",

I would go talk to a advisor to see how it would transfer to other schools but from what I remember the cap program was a direct copy of the UBC program so you should be able to transfer at least there. Maybe SFU program is similar too.",

I work along side one of the guys that was in charge of bringing a full program in, and even he says it doesn\u2019t compare to UBC or SFU. Unfortunately they have had a hard time staffing they Kin program, as well as had trouble constructing classes. From what I know the 2year kin program and transferring to UBC has worked well for people.",

We're looking for people who qualify to pick up a product at a hotel in downtown Vancouver, test it at home, and then complete a 20 minute online questionnaire within 2-3 days. \n\nSee if you qualify for the study by completing this short 5-minute survey by clicking on the link below. If selected and you complete the exercise, you will receive a $40 online gift card to one of several retailers (including Mastercard and [Amazon.ca](https://Amazon.ca)) to thank you for your time. \n\n[https://surveys.insightswest.com/SE/69/CoffeeHUT/](https://surveys.insightswest.com/SE/69/CoffeeHUT/)\n\nPlease be assured that this study is strictly for research purposes only.

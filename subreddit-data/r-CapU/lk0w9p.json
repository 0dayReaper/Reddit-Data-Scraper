And everyone around has been quite friendly. Bus to campus is available but sometimes isn't a thing if you are on campus late. The walk isn't too bad and I have made it many times this year. Food can be a hit or miss and is missing some key parts for nutrition, namely fruit. but there is a diverse choice so you can kinda pick what you want to eat.",

We were both coming from out of province and it was the easiest housing to secure at the time. \n\nThe majority of people are straight from high school though. I find not a lot of people stay after 1st year since you\u2019ll make friends in Uni and move into housing with them but some people will stay all four years.",

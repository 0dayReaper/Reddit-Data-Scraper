Though I\u2019ve been considering taking it at Emily Carr University as well, I\u2019d like to know if anyone here has any experience on how the class works. Things like the program used, the overall experience and more.",

            "comment": "I'm nearing the end of my first year and so far it's been a blast for me. I believe Emily Car is a 4 year program and that comes with its own perks but I didn't want to be in school that long. \n\nBecause this is just a two year program it goes very quickly. There is a lot to learn and a lot of work to do (tho ive seen others have it worse in other schools) if you are quick at drawing (you don't have to be great, just fast) and take feedback really well, then it will be easier. The program focuses heavily on hand drawn animation, especially in the first year. \n\nI'd suggest emailing an animation studio and seeing if you can find one what will do a job shadow, or just try animating to see how you like it if you havent already. Like I said, it's a lot of work, but if you love the work it it'll be a blast. Capilano students also have a good reputation in the local industry, so that is also a perk.",

            "comment": "Cap is great if you're not sure what you want to do in animation and want to try a little bit of everything (storyboards, character design, backgrounds, etc.), although the program mostly focuses on the actual animation. You don't need any animation experience to get in, though. If you already know specifically what area you want to specialize in, I think it might be a better use of your time and money to take some online classes that focus on that, although you'll miss the social aspect, and Cap does get you access to some pretty cool events. I work in BGs but if you want any help with applying or to speak to someone who works in a certain role let me know and I'll connect you:)",

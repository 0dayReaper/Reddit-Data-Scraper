    "postText": "Hi there, I just recently finished MOPA and I still have my first year books on hand. These books include:\n\n-A to Z Guide to Film Terms by Tim Moshansky\n\n-Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting by Syd Field\n\n-Writing The Short Film by Pat Cooper and Ken Dancyger\n\n-Adaptation: The Shooting Script by Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman\n\n-Making The Magic Happen: The Art and Craft of Film Directing by Peter D Marshall\n\nAll of the books are in good used condition (some minor wear or bending on some covers or pages). These are all required or recommended books for first year MOPA as of this past school year. The only book that is usually asked to be bought that is NOT included in this bundle is the Juno Shooting Script.\n\nI'm looking to sell all of these books together to an incoming MOPA student for about $50 (regular retail price ~$200+ dollars). I can meetup in the Vancouver area or can mail anywhere in Canada if you pay for shipping. Contact me if you are interested.",

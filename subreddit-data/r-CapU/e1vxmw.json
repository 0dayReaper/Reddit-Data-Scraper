Although not much of UE4 was not covered during the first two semesters, one of the instructors has launched an optional summer program to cover Unreal in depth, available to all students in 3D Animation.  I am unsure whether the VFX students had this option.",

First of thanks for the response, secondly I recently received 2 admission offers from CapU (3D animation and Visual Effects) so after due consideration I have decided to go for Visual Effects. What did you learned about UE4 in first two  semesters?",

Environment creation in UE4 was covered only a little bit at the end of the second semester.  For the summer program, which is happening right now, we are covering:  \n\n\n1. Animation - Importing assets (rigs) and animation across programs (Maya to EU4 vice versa).  Using UE4 to render animation projects.\n\n2. Cinematics and Rendering - Making it look good in EU4 + \\*Ray Tracing\\*\n\n3. Particles in UE4 - custom meshes for advanced FX simulations. \n\n4. Blueprints for Character creation - character controlled elements and fx\n\n5. Advanced materials for FX and Environments - Parallax Occlusion Material\n\n6. Lighting and blueprints for environments\n\n7. Obscure tools and advanced techniques - existing modelling and sculpting tools inside Unreal\n\nAnother instructor has also launched a summer program to cover Katana in-depth as well.\n\nWith UE5 coming out soon, idk how this will change for the coming year, but my guess is that more and more people will want to start learning UE4..  \nGoodluck!",

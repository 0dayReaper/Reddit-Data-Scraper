            "comment": "Hi!  \n\n\nIt's a competitive program! Basically everyone has at least one degree prior to getting into the diploma, not sure what the requirements are for the Degree but I imagine the GPA requirements are solid, it's a hard program. There were several people there who had a BA and also a MA, Msc, accounting degree, or nursing degree. Some people will have worked in offices or law firms but many won't have, so don't let that stop you, and don't take any guff from anyone who says anything else.  People are weirdly competitive inside it, also (you're supposed to maintain a B average, but it's more like competition for who gets the highest \"A\"). I think you submit an essay with your transcripts etc, and there's just a short interview where you say things like I love law, I need a career, etc. \n\nThe program itself can be a little intense. You take two years of classes with the same people. I hear some years are better than others. The instructors are mostly pretty great, and the material is interesting, but it's hard. But so is working in the legal field. I think it does a pretty good job of giving you a well-rounded intro, if not preparing you for everything.",

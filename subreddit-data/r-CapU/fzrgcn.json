    "postText": "Hi,   \nI know no one knows for sure, but I was wondering if anyone knows anything about what's going to happen to the Fall semester? I just received my admission, but I'm an international student so I'm obviously unsure if I'll be able to attend at all... But if I end up going, I need to start my visa application asap. \n\nI know there's a chance it might be taught remotely. Anyone knows how the Animation department is dealing with distance learning? For instance, my Bachelor's (art) school is having a lot of issues with their practical classes, specially their first year classes, so I'm not sure if Cap's Animation Department (I've been accepted to the 2d diploma) will start classes at all.. \n\nI'm sorry, as I said, I know no one knows for sure, but I'm anxious, and while I wait for the school's reply, I figured I could try posting here, specially about the second question. I'm an older student, so I really hope I don't have to defer or reapply for Fall 2021.\n\nThanks :(",

At this time, they\u2019re planning to proceed with the fall semester as normal. Although that could possibly change, that\u2019s their current stance.",

If things look up, fall sem will most likely be normal, otherwise I would assume it\u2019s just gonna be done online. That\u2019s just my guess though.",

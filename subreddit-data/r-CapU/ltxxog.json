    "postText": "Hi everyone, just wanted to see if anyone in the BBA program has received any word if they have applied to graduate? I am in my last term and aim to graduate once the term is done (late May) and applied a couple of weeks ago and haven't heard anything. Also, there seems to be no way to check the application status on CapU Login.  Thanks everyone!",

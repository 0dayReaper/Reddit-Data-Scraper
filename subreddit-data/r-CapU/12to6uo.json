I am in Bachelor\u2019s of Business in Accounting and with my dim future with no social life, this Uni makes it worse. This Uni maybe good for Arts and 3D Animation course but worse for other degree such as Business and paralegal in western part of the world. I know I will not get a good job after graduation because at present my GPA is merely 3.9 out of 4.33 and it would slightly decrease over the years so no accounting job for me and no friends here to network with. Feels sad but for me its cheaper to study here than SFU or UBC so guess will be here for more than 2 years. Its not like I am not trying to make friends but even when a group is formed for projects everyone is so disinterested and would try to socially alienate as much as possible after the conclusion of the term. Its the end, new sem commences and its same thing again.",

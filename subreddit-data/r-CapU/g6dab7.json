    "postText": "I recently got accepted into the 3D Animation for Film and Games Diploma program, but my parents insisted that I had to have a bachelor's degree in order to have an easier life finding a job in the future. However, I don't see any bachelor's degree for animation. I don't believe that I need a bachelor's degree, but I also think it could be true that my life could be easier with one. But this is Capilano we're talking about, I don't think the bachelor's degree matters? Also... my second choice was 2D, but now I'm not sure if I like 3D or 2D more... is it worth going back to do the 2D program later?\n\nAnd tbh I'm scared I'll have a hard time finding a suitable career in the future... Does anyone have any experiences they can share? Thanks",

            "comment": "Hi! I think what your parents are saying is true for some careers, but animation, and most art-related/creative careers, heavily rely on portfolio and reel. Having said that, if you're freshly out of high school you need to consider if two years will be enough for you to start your career. You could do the 2d diploma afterwards, but you'll eventually need to choose which field you'll specialize in (and I think it would be better to do it the other way round, so you get all the art and drawing foundation classes before getting to 3d - not something you need, but something that will definitely help). \n\nSo I wouldn't necessarily think about the degree you'll earn, but if the time of the program will be enough for you to learn as much as possible.",

            "comment": "I get where your parents come from, mine were the same, but I think the world is changing and you don\u2019t need a bachellors degree as much as you used to need it like 15 years ago. CapU does not have a bachellors degree for animation and I think you\u2019ll be fine without one (correct me if I\u2019m wrong). It\u2019s more about how good you are at what you do than your degree. I have an associate degree in communications and I\u2019m doing pretty good in life. Although, I am going to get my Bachellors just because I am taking a new route in my carreer and want to specialize in educational conmunications and probably get a masters and a phD. As for the 3D or 2D program, go with your gut, if you dont like one you can tranfer to the other one or later in life study the one you didn\u2019t choose. Life is one long ass run, so take your time and enjoy it. \n\nTo summarize all of this: you do not need a bachellors degree to find a suitable job, you can get the degree later if you see fit (you can transfer your credits from your diploma to your bachellors, that\u2019s what I did) and you\u2019ll be fine. Hope this helped a little!",

Your parents are old school. Which is understandable. They just want you to be job safe and be \u201cmore competitive\u201d. \n\nIn the 3D industry, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have a bachelor. You just need to have a good portfolio. Keep in mind. This portfolio needs to be updated after every job you do and that takes a lot of effort and time to catch up with the ever increasing graphic technology. You have to learn new programs (most are similar) etc. \n\nHeck, you can even stay home and learn from home (and save $30,000) through various resources and come up with an awesome portfolio and still get a job. It just takes discipline and time. However much time you put in to better yourself is how competitive you are to other people applying for a job in 3D.\n\nIf you want to be more competitive. I recommend researching what there are less of and what is difficult to learn. When I was working there, people who could script were rare gold. I was a modeler, lighter, animator etc.  I was competing with 2000 other people for a job.\n\nI knew a guy Who scripted his entire visual effects portfolio. Animation model and everything. He now works at weta (headhunted). Making 6 figures.",

            "comment": "I am an international student as well and I got accepted for this Fall Term 2021. \n\nIELTS overall 6.5 it's the minimum they ask, so you are OK. The other requirements are a letter of intent, an entrance questionnaire and an interview. I wrote a one-page letter of intent about my passion for film, the entrance questionnaire is very easy, they ask you to choose two questions from five and answer them (ex. describe a film you love and why people should watch it), and in my case the interview was waived so I don't know how that goes. \n\nMaking short films for sure helps you because you can talk about that on the letter of intent, but they won't look at them if that's what you are asking. \n\nHope that helps a little bit, good luck.",

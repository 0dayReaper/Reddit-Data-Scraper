Don't be creepy (Stalking, asking people out in DMs, y'know what I mean) \n    2. No Racism/Homophobia/etc, we are nice pirates \n    3. It is an anarchy server, we are not THAT nice, feel free to grief \n    4. No lag machines\n\n(Please contact a mod on our discord if you see anyone/anything violating the rules)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 \ud83d\udcf7 HOW TO JOIN ON BEDROCK\ud83d\udcf7 \ud83d\udcf7\n\nin order to join, go to servers &gt; scroll down &gt; add server In address type 147.135.104.143 In the port type 19228\n\n\\*The plugin to allow bedrock users seems to be buggy for switch users, likely seems to be an issue with the software not allowing new connections",

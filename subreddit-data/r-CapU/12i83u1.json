I did not find that it was addressed in any way and even when I asked professors questions, it was avoided. I also had concerns about some teachings of what were common practices in ABA therapy which were also essentially ignored by my professors. \n\nThis is just my experience though!",

As an ex social worker who has used ABA therapy in practice I have no clue where abuse has been used within a therapy session...I think you should experience the course for yourself and decide whether that's something you wanna do or maybe try a co-op at a place that uses that within their practice....I would stay away from assumptions I can't speak for every practice out there everything has their own issues",

            "comment": "I find this to be an outdated perspective on ABA. The vast majority of people (including the profs at CapU) practice something called PBS (positive behaviour support) which incorporates ABA but does not encourage punishment routines. The principles of ABA are founded, in large part, upon operant conditioning which occur around us all the time.\n\nNow CAN the tools of ABA be used for harm? Yes, of course, like anything. I worked in the field for many years and never saw things like this though. There are videos on YouTube of horrible old practices that show this and those are disturbing. Thank goodness those days are gone and anyone conducting themselves as such would be seen as highly unethical within the community.\n\nMy recommendation would be to take what you hear with a huge grain of salt and try it for yourself before you decide. I believe 95% of the people are in the field for the right reasons - to help those in need. Like any field, you will always have a small minority of those who do not uphold those values.",

Has some light work but I also took it 3 years ago so that could have changed. \n\nCMNS 235 Understanding news - good course if you like politics or news. Some writing assignments but not too heavy. \n\nCMNS 395 Public and Media Relations or CMNS project groups in media campaigns - a little harder and a bit of work but a really fun course. \n\nPOL 104 - a bit of writing and can be stale but as long as you do some work you\u2019ll do well\n\nBMKT 369 Digital Marketing- super fun course, a good amount of work but if you are a marketing specialization you may already have to take this. \n\nHope this helps. Some of these courses may change a bit so remember to take this with a grain of salt. Remember you can also get your minor bow if you want :)",

    "postText": "Hey I'm thinking of applying to CapU either this fall or the next one and I've got tons of questions I'd really love to be clear on, mostly on the financial side of things bcs I'm aware that the program is relatively on the costly side especially for int'l students and that's where my parents struggle with. I'm wondering whether scholarships are available, and if so what are the chances of getting it?? Am I able to work part time as soon as I get to Vancouver?? If so, to what extent would it cover my living costs and/or potentially my tuition fee?? All in all I'm just very anxious that I won't be able to make it through bcs of my financial restraints so I'm just seeking for some reassurances. I'd love it if anyone here would like to help out and dive into all the numbers.. Thanks a lot!!",

It\u2019s all online on their website. I believe it\u2019s about 2100 per course for international. Rent here is not the greatest, goes from 1600-2000/month. Best to look for roommates. Or live on campus. \n\nIf finances are stopping you I recommend you look at cheaper provinces. Both tuition fees and rent is cheaper. Places like Winnipeg, Alberta. Saskatchewan. \n\nIf you can pay for all that in bc. I recommend you look at other universities such as ubc/sfu as they are more reputable.",

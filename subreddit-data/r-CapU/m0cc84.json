I was wondering how the kin program is like here? i don\u2019t know anyone that attended capu, and I\u2019m thinking about going here this fall. my long term goal was to become an audiologist and finish my masters at UBC, and I just wanted to know if that was possible if i went to capu? i read that i would had to have graduated from a university here, but for some reason i have people telling me only sfu and ubc qualify for that which is really confusing me. If anyone could tell me how the program is like there, and if it was possible for me to finish my bachelors there and apply to ubc audiology, that would be great!!:)",

            "comment": "Hello! I am currently in my second year in the program and it is awesome. I know other people who are in the program at UBC and it is basically the exact same courses just for cheaper and with less people in the classes. You get to build a better relationship with the teachers which I find so rewarding. With covid and having smaller class sizes, this actually made it so that one of the classes (103 Active Health) was able to be in person for a lab once a week last semester, which would not have been possible for ubc or sfu. After graduating from the bachelors program I plan on going to ubc for my masters in physiotherapy, which I know is possible. I am not completely sure if it is the same with audiology, but would assume so considering it works for other masters programs and it is an accredited university. I hope this helps! :)",

I believe in most bachelors programs the cost does get more expensive in the two years, but in this program it\u2019s because you choose a specialization (exercise science or health promotion) and then have more specified courses tailored to your option. You also get mentored one on one by of the faculty members during the last two years and they help you find career and volunteer opportunities relevant to what you want to learn. And there is one class where you do have to do fitness testing with a partner (kin 103), but you are not evaluated on how fit you are it is just so you learn how to properly assess someone else\u2019s fitness levels! :)",

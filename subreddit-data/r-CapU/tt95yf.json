Are there any demand for 2D (whether animation or concept) artist in Vancouver? \n\nI tried to look up jobs online and found most of them are 3D. So it\u2019s nice to hear from someone on the field.",

If you\u2019re interested in both I\u2019d lean towards 3D as well; it\u2018s a steeper learning curve but our studio is always looking for more 3D artists than 2D.  In terms of 2D jobs I definitely see most of the demand for animation itself. Concept art is really competitive so I\u2019d have a backup just in case!",

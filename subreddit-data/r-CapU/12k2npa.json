I\u2019ve also received my username, Student ID and email. \n\nMy application is now being revised by the area/department. \u201cThe program area may require additional information such as an audition, interview, portfolio, etc.\u201d \n\nHow long did you have to wait after your initial application to get your final confirmation of admission from the school/program department? Also, did you have to undergo an interview with the university?",

We pay almost 23-24k each year so its easy for us. But technically getting admission at Cap is not difficult. Just be confident about the interview. \n\nJust to give you a hint.\nBack in my country I got into the top business school due to my high school grades but I was introvert and had an anxiety to talk to people and I had to give in person interview in-front of the 4 admission officers and they asked me about myself and future goals. Just be confident be prepared, research some type of questions they would ask and prepare beforehand so you don\u2019t feel embarrassed if you can\u2019t think of anything at the spot.",

I'm in legal studies; I don't know what ECCE manages their applications. Also, I applied when everyone was working from home on account of you-know-what, so hopefully everyone's gotten back up to speed now.",

Classes are small, profs are chill (at least mine are), nothing's graded on a scale (unlike SFU/UBC), and I feel like there's a \"small school\" vibe going around. \n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that getting there by transit can be annoying, and traffic on the bridge can be the death of you if you're coming from anywhere besides the north shore.",

Seems pretty dead if its not a weekday I guess. Librarian said they're \"not known for their food\" but there's a grocery store walking distance.\n\nDope climbing gym close by which if your not into climbing yet I highly recommend, great way to socialize, stay in shape and use your brain in fun ways. (I'm biased obviosly) \n\nBus drops you right on campus so access to the rest of the city is pretty easy. pretty awesome wilderness around the campus and lots of trees.",

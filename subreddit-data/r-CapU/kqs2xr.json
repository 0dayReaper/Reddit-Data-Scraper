    "postText": "Trying to apply for the MOPA program in the fall of 2021. Does anybody exactly know what the \"tuition surcharge\" would be used for. It sure is expensive and is basically more expensive than the tuition itself. Also, I feel like this is a dumb question, but is there any way to opt-out of this? Thanks for the patience guys",

            "comment": "That\u2019s the cost of the program. Capilano charges a base tuition per credit. MOPA charges an additional fee per credit for their own cost. It\u2019s non-negotiable. The program is an extremely expensive one- 65k for four years.\n\nThis cost goes towards the camera gear, computer labs, software licensing, audio recording rooms, full sized studios, instructor salaries, the insurance they take out on our productions and every single student, etc.",

            "comment": "Residence sent out their room offers in the begging of July. Have you checked your CapU email? Even if you didn\u2019t get a room they would have sent you an email about it. The deadline for accepting your room offer has passed now (ended on the 18th) but they are always willing to help students who may have had problems accepting the room. I think they are doing another wave of room offers for those who applied late. I would check your CapU email and email them right away at (housing@capilanou.ca)\n\nIf your looking for a place to maybe rent I would look in the capilano students union housing registry.\n\nHopefully this helped and if you have any more questions ask away!",

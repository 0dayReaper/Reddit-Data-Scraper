    "postText": "So there I was, first day on campus just sitting on a bench along the Seymour trail, behind Bosa. At the time I was flipping through my phone, only to look up and see  an old man (maybe late 60's) with his dick in his hand while shaking it, at the head of the Seymour trail. He was effectively blocking my exit.\n\nI assumed for the first few shakes that he was just finishing up takin a piss. So I ignored him, and then after a few minutes I look back up and he was still \"shaking it off\", but once he made eye contact with me, he then full on faced me and started ferociously masturbating with even more gusto.\n\nI should have taken a picture, but instead my jaw dropped and I forgot my training; I didn't just raise my phone and yell that I was live streaming him.\n\nI told campus Security, and the CSU about this, if you're wondering. Also, remember since Pepper spray is illegal to use in Canada, instead try Lysol and hairspray as  perfectly legal alternatives. Remember though that Canada doesn't really have a \" Self Defense \" argument in court, so it's better to avoid an altercation.",

Or are you implying that being disgusted by the Autonomy of Police, the un-qualified immunity, lack of accountability, systemic racism, gross misuse of power resulting in countless murdered citizens, Mysogyny, Homophobia, sadism, and the fact they all band together to protect the \"bad apples\" means I'm under age? Or that having an educated opinion on the poor performance of North American police especially is a generational thing, which it's not but okay. Yeah, if you feel like elaborating on your request, I may be able to understand if your a bootlicker or not, just kidding, I already know.",

However, each cop signs up to be a fascist oppressor in this day and age, so that makes them all bastards. Now,  about cops risking their lives for me, no they are not, and have never done so. That's a myth, nurses have much more dangerous jobs for example and don't violently murder any patients with impunity.",

Perhaps if you took a more personal approach you would recognize that each woman or man in a uniform grew up with friends and family just like you and I. I\u2019m not sure where your hatred comes from, but I am certain it is misplaced. If you\u2019ve never heard of the term discrimination, perhaps you should look it up and practice being a better human being. There\u2019s no room for hatred in this world.",

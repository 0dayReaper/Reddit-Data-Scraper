    "postText": " Hey guys, I was wondering if I could get any help/advice from any MOPA graduates from CAP, or any other film school. Also just looking for advice from anybody that hires graduates in the film industry.\n\nI'm currently taking classes at SFU and was looking to apply for the fall 4-year MOPA program. I, unfortunately, missed the application cut-off date due to the scrambling mess which is job searching. I am unable to apply anytime until NEXT YEAR. I was just wondering if anybody could suggest or give info about film programs in different unis such as the VFS, BCIT, UBC, or any other school I might not know about.\n\nFor example ik, VFS is a viable option, but what confuses me is that people talk about it being super expensive when it is around $32k, while CAP's 4 year program is about $64k for the 4 years. Am I reading smthg wrong? Is it 32k for a year of VFS or smthg?\n\nAlso if there are any industry hiring people out there, or if anybody could help me get into direct contact with somebody that is, I would much appreciate it. I just want to know if the school a graduate  \ncomes from out of actually makes a difference in the hiring process, and what the difference is when hiring a 2-year graduate or a 4-year graduate.\n\nI don't even mind moving to another part of Canada, or to a close part of the USA once the pandemic dies down. I just know that I do not want to wait another year.\n\nThanks guys",

Just make sure that if you're going to transfer, your classes have equivalents at the other school~ Also, this is a given, but the cafeteria food is such a rip off, just bring snacks. If you have some questions about Psyc professors, I can recommend some good ones and some iffy ones! Allssooo, Moodle is really handy if your teachers use it. Anndd I don't know any more tips, but if you have questions, ask away! I think Cap is pretty good as a school to start out at!",

I can definitely recommend Leonard George and Janet Waters if you decide to take more Psyc courses. Leonard is just a really interesting dude, and Janet is awesome and geeky. People say she's really boring, but if you're in to Battlestar Galactica or LoTR, she's perfect!",

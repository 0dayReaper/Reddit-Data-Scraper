    "postText": "Hey! Grade 11 student here wondering about the 2D animation program? This is currently my first choice university but I would love to hear it from the students themselves! I know opinions may not be the best with covid but if anybody attended the program or had a great experience at other 2D programs in BC I would love to know! I also have a couple of other questions.\n\n1. Is the in-house residence good? \n2. How is the social life/overall community in CAPU?\n3. What are they looking for when observing portfolios?",

I'm a 3D animation student at CapU, but I wanted to let ya know that there is a CapU animation discord server when many students and future/current applicants are hanging out in. A lot of the applicants will share their portfolios for review by the other students and there are a lot of people living in student residence so PM me if you are i interested!\n\nedit: it has been recently changed that only mods can send invites so I'm redirecting you to this post talking about the server: https://www.reddit.com/r/CapU/comments/jridmp/capu_animation_hopefuls_discord/",

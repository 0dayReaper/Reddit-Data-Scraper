I have a similar situation and our department has made accommodations for such circumstances. \n\nOtherwise there are spaces you used to be able to book in the library. Not sure if that's still offered, but could try there. \n\nAnother option are upper floors. Fir, Birch and Arbutus are big buildings with lots of classrooms. I'm really not sure how busy the upper floors are during those days, but you can go round and do some musical chairs with classrooms. Also, lots of these rooms have their schedule posted outside, be it by paper or that little terminal. The library also can be vacant at times too. \n\nLastly you can connect with student services and relay your dealio. They may have an option.",

Job action has been going on for 3 weeks and the employer refuses to meet with the union (the support staff) so they can come to a resolution. \n\n\"If you work for the university you shouldn't be working from home\" - the president, VPs, directors, managers and other exempt staff (entire HR department) should also not be working from home then. They get the big salaries + working from home?\n\nCapU has serious issues with recruitment and retention - the flexibility of working from home is one thing that the university can offer that does not cost any money and improves the work/life balance of employees.\n\nAdditionally: it is the employer who needs to reconsider their stance and return to the bargaining table. Instead of this petition, students should be emailing the president at CapU as he has the power to make this stop by having the employer return to the bargaining table.",

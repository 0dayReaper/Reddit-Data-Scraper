I recently received a \"D\" grade in two of my prerequisites and was wondering if I am able to proceed to take the leading courses without having to retake the prerequisites, and instead take them in a different term like summer for example. Thanks.",

If the next course lists your course with a minimum grade such as \u201cC-\u201c then you will be de-registered unless you are able to get a prerequisite waiver.",

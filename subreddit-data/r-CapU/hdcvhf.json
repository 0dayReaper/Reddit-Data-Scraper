    "postText": "I am interested in doing the paralegal online certificate from CapU, but am wondering what the career prospects are. Do those with a paralegal diploma from CapU have a better chance of being hired than those with a paralegal certificate from CapU?\n\nAlso, is entry into the certificate program competitive?\n\nAny insight is appreciated as I am not from Vancouver.",

            "comment": "I've heard from personal experience that entry in the diploma and the certificate are competitive as applicants have previous bachelor's degrees. But that shouldn't scare you from applying as a good recommendation, resume and interview will make u an ideal candidate for them! They seem to like people who are passionate about the legal studies as Cap is one of the only credited legal studies school in Canada. As for the jobs you can work in any firm, notary office or even strata managment firms. \n\nGood luck!!",

    "postText": "Hi!\nI have received my offer letter from Capilano University for MOPA. But due to the pandemic I am yet to complete my finals. I am yet to receive my Study Permit. Capilano University has asked to confirm my residence, in the case that I make it to Vancouver in the fall semester. But I am unsure if I will be in Canada for the Fall Semester. Coming to my question: if I do not intend to stay in the Capilano Residence for fall 2020. What are my other residence options?",

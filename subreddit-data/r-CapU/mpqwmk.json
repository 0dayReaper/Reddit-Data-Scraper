            "comment": "with covid, we have only had two days of school and we are divided in 4 cohorts. Depends on which cohort you'll be, you will get a different schedule. For example I'm in Cohort 1 and I have classes Mondays and Wednesdays. Mondays from 12:30 to 7:30 and Wednesdays from 8:30 to 7:30. Next semester we will have all classes in person, so I assume we will have more school time, but as for now this is how it is. \ud83d\ude05Hope I answered your question! \ud83d\ude01",

So you'd be class 8:30-11:30, lunch, then class 1-4. one or two days a week you'd only have the morning or afternoon class. Some time you're there until 6 or even 10 at night working on editing though, all depends. The schedule changes a lot week to week in second semester, depends on the role you have in production and the amount of work you have to do in editing. it's a blast though!",

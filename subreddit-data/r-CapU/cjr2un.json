I\u2019m an out of province students and honestly res was just the easier option than stressing about finding a place to rent the first year, and if it\u2019s your first year of university and living away from your parents, not having to cook or clean does take a load off of your plate. Cap is also very much a commuter school, and the social life isn\u2019t crazy, so res is a good way to meet people and participate in social events.\n\nI\u2019m in MOPA, so I think my class experience will be a lot different than other programs but I personally really enjoy the program and the instructors. My instructors for non-MOPA electives were all really great too.",

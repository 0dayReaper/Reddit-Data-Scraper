I would appreciate any opinions or tips for my current situation right now as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

It is no where near as extensive as the MOPA program, but mostly gives you a one day crash course in set safety and etiquette. It doesn\u2019t compare to taking actual courses but you will need it to become a union permittee or member.",

Except for the top few they all make around 85k/ year, which isn't that much more than a highschool teacher.  Especially given that elementary school principles make like 95k.\n\nOn the same website I found that my crappy planning advisor from highschool, Mr. Prepchuk makes 85k and I don't know what he even does all day...\n\nSo no, I'm not very impressed with their salaries.",

Also Greg Lee retired (replaced by Kris Bulcroft). \n\nI have mixed feelings about the salaries on the list -- Capilano needs to attract good people, and part of that is through pay. On the other hand, some of the names on that list don't always seem to pull their weight...",

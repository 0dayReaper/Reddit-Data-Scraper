    "postText": "Current timeline:\nOn May 12th, members of MoveUp issue a 72 hour strike notice; their demands entail wage disputes, access to remote/hybrid work, improved benefits, etc. Three days later on May 15th, MoveUp union members begin to picket on campus. \nOn June 6th, the University Faculty Association joins in solidarity. Consequently classes and events have been cancelled until further notice. \n\n\nAs students do you have any thoughts or opinions about the ongoing strike? \nDo you feel you are receiving enough information to be adequately informed?\n\n\nI would love to be educated better on the matter; I\u2019m a firm believer that (civil) diverse views help us understand one another.\n\nMoveUp\u2019s petition is also in the comments for those interested.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s been brutal in terms of celebrating our accomplishments without our faculty present at convocation this year. Two years ago we couldn\u2019t celebrate our diploma achievements due to Covid, now a strike. There have been many tears shed and frustration all around. Some of the mature students graduating couldn\u2019t find childcare for those little ones due to the children\u2019s center being closed. Having to run up the hill to hug and thank your faculty while they held picket signs was not how even thought their graduation photos would turn out.  \nWith all the renovations and construction taking place on campus, you\u2019d think there was money available to avoid a strike altogether. \nI\u2019m a believer in fair bargaining and the employees do have a right to request/demand more but again the students and those not directly involved are impacted. \nAs we left campus and reflected on our time at CapilanoU, the consensus was bitterness, frustration and sadness.",

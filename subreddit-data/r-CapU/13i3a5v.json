    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming third year student in the IDEA School of Design program, and I'm looking into making friends from the 2D and 3D Animation program!\n\nI plan to major in illustration and I'm interested in working in the entertainment industry, more specifically in development (concept artist), and the pre-production department (background designer, character designer, storyboard artist). The illustration concentration has some overlap with the animation industry, hence why I would love to connect with students in the program :)\n\nSome of my interests include cartoons (Inside Job, Steven Universe, &amp; Gravity Falls), anime (Skip and Loafer, SpyxFamily, &amp; Fruits Basket), and video games (Genshin, Stardew Valley, &amp; Minecraft)!",

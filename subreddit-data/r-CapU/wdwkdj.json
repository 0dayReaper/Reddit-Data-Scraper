    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently in grade 11, and I'm hoping to apply to the LAA Program at Capilano. I have a few questions that I hope will be answered here. I'm not from Vancouver, so it's harder to just go in and ask questions. \n\nIs the 23% admission rate really that low? I feel like everyone who applies to Capilano gets in\n\nWhat is the dorm situation like? Do you have to apply, or does it come with acceptance? \n\nDo you need a car to commute between dorms and the campus or is it walkable? It says on google maps that it's a 15 minute walk, but it doesn't really look like it\n\nIs the LAA Program hard to get into? I've spoken to a few former students, and it doesn't sound like you need much more than what's on the website to be accepted, but is there anything else I should know? \n\nI hope these are all easily answered! Applying to university is already nerve-wracking, and these questions are making my anxiety worse as there are next to no answers online. Thank you!",

It may be easy to get into the university generally, but each program is another case. My classes are small (30ish students) so there\u2019s an indication of how many are let in. Regardless, get your application in ASAP; I applied in February and actually got waitlisted (I got in in the end) For me, there was an essay, letters of reference and an interview, which wasn\u2019t too difficult but I\u2019d say it would help to know what an LAA exactly is in relation to lawyers and paralegals, and have a clear answer as to why you want to do this. \n\nYou have to apply separately for dorms. Priority is given to first year students. You would almost certainly not need a car; an unlimited transit pass is included in tuition (which you cannot opt out of) and CapU has paid parking everywhere. You do have to take two(!) busses to get to campus. I personally would just walk or cycle, but I\u2019m biased towards that. They are building on-campus dorms, but those won\u2019t be ready until 2025ish. \n\nHope this helps!",

They offer either 1 year certificate, 2 year diploma, or 4 year degree programs. \n\nOnly the certificate program offers \u201cnight\u201d classes (more like evening; they\u2019re from 5:30-8:30 pm online) but it is only for people already working full time as paralegals, hence the time slot.\n\nThe diploma program on the other hand requires one to two years of existing post-secondary education. The degree program doesn\u2019t have either of these requirements.",

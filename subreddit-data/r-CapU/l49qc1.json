    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019m from Alberta and thinking of going here for my undergrad. (Only this uni and one school in ON offers a Paralegal degree). \n\nHow competitive is this program?\nWhat is the workload like?\nAny thoughts on dorm?\nCheapest places to live in close to the campus?\nIf you graduated from the program or still in the program, did you or do you have a job related to the program?\n\n**if there\u2019s anyone here from AB, how easy did you get a job after (if you went back to AB for a job after graduating). \n\nThanks so much in advance!! Anything helps!",

            "comment": "Hi, \nI'm in the paralegal degree program! (3rd year) \nIt's fairly competitive to get into, they have maybe 15-20 spots per year for the degree, but I think if you have good grades you should be fine, the most important thing is to submit your application early!!\n\nI stayed at Res in my first year, it's quite expensive - but relative to the housing options it's decent (the food is terrible!) If you can find cheaper rentable place that may be a good option. Res is quite good for making friends though! That's where I made most of my friends! So it's a great community environment, I'd recommend you could do your first semester at res, see how you like it, then stay the next semester or rent somewhere else. \n\nOverall, I've noticed the paralegal program to have a higher standard than other programs in the school. The books are expensive, and the homework can be quite plentiful. But if you're actually interested in the law itself, the assignments can be very interesting! \n\nI went to SFU for one year before CapU, I MUCH prefer CapU! It has a smaller more personal class size (35 students) which, if you're just coming out of highschool seems \"lame\" (for lack of a better word). But I can assure you it's much better than class sizes of 100+ \n\nFinding an easy job like working at a cafe should be super easy, but finding a job with more substance to it can be very hard! So it's hit or miss, depends on what you can find. \n\nHope that helps! (Sorry I'm on mobile and the formatting may be weird)",

LOL \n\nI\u2019ve actually done 2 years of diploma in a polytechnic college here in AB and based on what you\u2019re saying I guess the class size is pretty much the same! \n\nWow! That is pretty competitive! Just wondering if you don\u2019t mind, what did you do to make your application stand out? Past experiences in legal field? \n\nIs rent relatively cheap in your opinion?",

                            "comment": "When I applied, my grade average was approximately an A-, so I think that helped. I also needed two reference letters. I got one from my highschool history teacher and the other from a family friend who happened to be an MLA (so I think that helped a bit, though I'm not entirely sure). \n\n*And I had no past experience in a legal field actually.\n\nThen you have to go in for an interview and write an essay about why you want to be a paralegal. (sounds daunting, but it really wasn't too bad). I honestly don't think I stood out too much for that, just try to sound passionate about it!  \n\nI actually submitted my application just before the deadline - all the spots were full but they accepted me for the following year! (So that's why I recommend early submission!)\n\nRent in North Vancouver is definitely not cheap! (killed me a bit inside ngl) \nResidence was $1,100 per month! But it at least included food!\n\nYou can probably find a rentable situation where you're paying 500-1,500 a month, (honestly I'm being generous with the $500, you'd be SUPER lucky!) depending on the type you can find. There are private homes that offer students lower rent prices, you can find them through the CapU website I believe.",

Other schools offer paralegal diplomas, but they aren't as well renowned. So if you want to join the legal profession Cap is probably the best way to go (in BC as far as I know). \n\nAlso the reason the yearly acceptance into the degree program is less than 35 is because your classes will be half-filled with diploma students (I have so much respect for them, they do almost all the same amount of classes but in two years!)",

If you already have two years of post-secondary school of I'd totally  recommend that!\nThe only advantage to doing the degree option is that it gives you a degree which you can use to get into law school (my future plan)\n\nHowever, if you're end goal is just to be a paralegal I think going with the diploma is the better option, you get out two years earlier!",

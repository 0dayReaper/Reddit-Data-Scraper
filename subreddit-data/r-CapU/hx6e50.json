    "postText": "I'm considering doing the online option to take the program with my job. However, I'm worried it's not going to be as effective as the FT option because the courses would be online, which could mean less networking. It's also spread out by 2 years, which is quite longer compared to other schools. \n\nI know Capilano is considered the best school for LAA studies. Is the LAA part-time program as reputable as the FT program amongst employers? Do you also need prior office experience to be admitted to the PT program? They only have one intake per year in September, so I feel pressured to make a decision soon.",

Cap U is highly recommend for both Paralegal and LAA options. I am still studying there, and am in contact with many profs from the LAA certificate , so if you have any questions feel free to pm me or ask here",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m starting the paralegal certificate program in September &amp; will be needing a new laptop for back to school! \nIdeally, I\u2019d prefer to purchase a MacBook but was wondering if anyone has gone through the program using one &amp; if softwares used in class are compatible? Asking because I did the legal assistant program at a different school &amp; it was highly recommended that we use a computer with windows OS. \n\nThank you!! \ud83e\udd17",

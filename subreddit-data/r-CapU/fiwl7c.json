From the email below it looks like some classes might still go ahead but with special procedures in place - I\u2019m guessing like wet labs perhaps?\n\nHere\u2019s the email I got:\n\nDear Student,\n\nTo facilitate continuity of learning under the circumstances created by COVID-19, Capilano University will pause all university classes for Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17, 2020 to prepare for a shift away from in-person instruction for the remainder of the semester. Alternative forms of instructional delivery will resume remotely, or through other delivery methods, on Wednesday, March 18, 2020. Further information related to exam schedules and methods of examination delivery will be forthcoming as soon as details are confirmed.\n\nInstructors will advise their students as to the specific route that their classes will resume. Students are asked to monitor their email closely over the next several days for these instructions.\n\nPlease note that although the risk posed by COVID-19 in BC remains low for the general population, we are taking these steps to ensure learning continuity for our students in a manner aligned with the direction of the Provincial Health Officer. Classes that do resume in person will be required to be conducted with the appropriate social distancing recommended at this time.\n\nInstructors will receive more detailed information from Laureen Styles, VP Academic &amp; Provost as soon as details are confirmed.\n\nI do want to emphasize that the University will remain open with usual operating hours while we transition to the new model and for the remainder of semester.\n\nI recognize this is a challenging time for all, I want to thank everyone for facilitating as smooth a transition as possible. Your support is greatly appreciated.\n\nPaul Dangerfield\nPresident\nCapilano",

            "comment": "I took the Motion Picture Production Program (now the Motion Picture Arts) about 10 years ago. It\u2019s a bit of both theory and practical. I can\u2019t recall how many films I made in the first year as actual projects but in my experience a lot of the other students were very much on board with making films together outside of project assignments. I found I did more filming in my second year as I branched off of the main Motion Picture Production Program and took Cinematography for Film and Video instead, which focussed more on the practical side of things. All that being said my experience was a decade ago and was before they built the new building for the Motion Picture Arts program.\n\nMy advice, which I failed to heed myself, is to network as much as possible with other students/alumni, teachers, equipment rental, and most importantly the people you will meet that are working in the industry. Sometimes it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.",

            "comment": " It's a very hands-on program. You'll get your hands on a camera in the first week or two, and your first year you'll get some training in electrical, carpentry, etc. But the farther you go the more theory you'll do. There's a one year certificate, two year diploma, and four year bachelor's degree. Most people do the diploma or degree. From my understanding, it gets more theory-heavy in years 3 or 4. Whatever you do, you can't go wrong, everyone is industry-ready when they finish and start working pretty much right away. They have their own rental house that you'll borrow equipment from (everything you can think of, from cameras to lighting equipment to.... lots of other stuff I'm not familiar with, also two trucks that students who've been approved can take to drive equipment to off-site shooting locations). Their rental house is like a professional rental house and the software you have to use to fill out the rental forms is the same software they use in the industry, so it helps prepare you for the real world.",

You will meet the best people and have the most fun!\n\nSecond of all, you will make 3 films in first year (in teams), 2 big ones in second year, and 3 in third year. It is different from other film programs in universities in ontario etc because you learn everything. Theory, screenwriting, production design, etc. It\u2019s a ton of fun. Most programs are very concentrated but MOPA has everything.\nIf you have any more questions feel free to PM me!",

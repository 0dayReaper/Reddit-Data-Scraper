    "postText": "The title basically. I got accepted into one of the programs and while I am very excited I assumed i would be able to work maybe twice a week however I was talking with some people (who granted did not attend the animation diploma but film) and said it is so demanding that you definitely cannot work. \n\nSo I would like to ask how are the classes arranged generally speaking? Is there any room during the week to have a PT job or would it be only possible in weekends (was also told you have to attend school in saturdays??). \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Technically, you can work part-time, but if you're able not to (financially), I wouldn't. It's a demanding program with a lot of assignments per week. If it's 2d, you usually have an assignment per class weekly (and around 5-6 classes per semester), and if you don't have your own equipment, you'll want to stay at the computer labs to work on them. I had my own equipment, but most of my classmates stayed at school from 8 to 8 most days, with 3 to 6 hours of classes inbetween. You don't have classes on saturday, but again, if you need to finish an assignment, the labs are open for you to work at - and a lot of people do. \n\nLike I said - it's doable, but I'd only do it if you really need to. Dedicating as much time as possible to the program will grant you the best results.",

Completely different workload that puts you incredibly rigorous study in order to be industry ready within 2 years.\n\nAs for OP I should say that I have known people who were able to have a part time job during the first year of the 2D program, but never have I heard of anyone having one during the second year. The program is intense. I had equipment at home and I was still coming in on Saturdays and often times Sundays just to make sure I was focused enough to hit my deadlines.",

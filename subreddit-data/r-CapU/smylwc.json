    "postText": "Hello all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering what your experiences with Online Asynchronous have been like at Capilano. I took an Anthropology class online async in Spring 2021. It was held exactly how I thought these classes were taught by the university - self-paced, and accessible learning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my issue... I'm currently taking KINE 112 and it's online async but every week we have assignments due by a certain time, our midterm is only accessible for one scheduled hour that is during some of my classes, and the professors have unreasonably high expectations (for example, the lecture slides are 50 slides each and 2 lecture powerpoints per subject but we're not allowed to review our quizzes we have on eLearn to see where we might have gone wrong). Has anyone taken this version of KINE 112 online async with Jerome Genz (and multiple other professors I think???)",

I would recommend looking up individuals on Rate my Prof to see others' experiences becauses a couple have been very good, whereas others have been terrible! I notice most of the time the ratings reflect my experience and have started to really pay it more heed when choosing my classes.",

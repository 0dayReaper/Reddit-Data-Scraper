    "postText": "I'm applying for a 3-year diploma program and in its Elective Courses it has two sections. One has the specific courses that I need to take, the other is broad. It says:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Choose 27.00 credits of electives:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Business or Commerce credits (including Accounting, General Management, Marketing, Human Resources Management, International Business, Applied Business Technology)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Humanities credits (including English, Communications, Foreign Languages, History, Linguistics, Philosophy, Technical Writing)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other Public Administration credits (including Public Management, Local Government Law, Strategic Planning, Project Management, Program Evaluation, Performance Management, Leading and Managing in the Non-Profit Sector, Economic Development, Corporate Administration, First Nations - Local Government Relations)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Science/Applied Science credits (including Architecture, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computing Science, Engineering, Geography, Geology, Landscape Architecture, Math, Physics, Statistics, Human Kinetics, Kinesiology)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Social Science credits (including Anthropology, Criminology, Economics, Geography, Law, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Women's and Gender Studies, Community Planning)\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Do I need something from each category?\n2. Do they need to be of a certain level?\n3. I've already graduated from another university and have 60 transferable credits in 100- and 200-level courses. Could I just use all of those as credits for the electives?",

            "comment": "1. You should look at the diploma breakdown. Get an advisor for your program to send you a full break down\n\n2. Get on transfer credits ASAP, it took them almost a year to get mine in you better start early.\n\n3. Figure out if ur diploma can be later used in a bachelors if that is your aim. Again recommend talking to an advisor\n\nBe active and call the school to get info. Don't guess at all you will regret it.",

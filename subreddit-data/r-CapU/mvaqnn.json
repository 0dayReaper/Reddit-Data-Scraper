This is regarding a digital platform connecting individuals sharing similar interest in sports. Being a newcomer to the city, I have always found difficult to meet with people and play sports and now I believe COVID has just amplified this problem. We are trying to create a solution for players/individuals to connect and play.\n\nJust couple of minutes of your time would make a huge difference. Also let me know if you have any comments on this.\n\nPS: This survey is meant for post COVID world\n\nThank you :)",

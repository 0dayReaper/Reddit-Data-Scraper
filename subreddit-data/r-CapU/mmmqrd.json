    "postText": "Hi, future MOPA student here. I've been told living in residency would be ideal because a) the program is so demanding and b) it helps forge connections, which in the film industry is crucial. Problem is my parents are very insistent on me saving money and living at home, at least for first year, so I can get a feel for things. Plus I live in Burnaby so the commute isn't terrible.\n\nI have two questions for current/former MOPA students:\n\n1. How much more ideal is residency, particularly in terms of making connections with other students and within the film industry?\n\n2. How can I convince my parents otherwise?",

            "comment": "Not at all crucial- stay at home and save money. You\u2019ll make connections simply by being in MOPA- the program is small, you take classes with the same cohort, and do a lot of group work. My first year in MOPA, there was maybe 20% of us on res, and it was people from out of town for the most part. Most people live at home or off campus.",

            "comment": "Hey. I\u2019m a business student living on residence and honestly almost everyone in my building is in MOPA. They seem like a pretty tight knit community and all appear to be great friends, I usually stick to myself but I\u2019ve been to a couple of their \u201cparties\u201d (when restrictions were looser over the summer) and they all seem to have a lot of fun with eachother. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a group of people who are energetic and passionate about film I would recommend trying out residence for a semester. I know you\u2019re worried about saving money and if it helps the case, you get a free metro card with school and the food on campus is decent and does the job. It is possible to save money! \n\nTLDR- It\u2019s definitely not necessary but a good way to meet people and still quite possible to save money.",

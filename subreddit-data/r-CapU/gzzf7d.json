I think it's like $50 and caledl an English Diagnostics Test, or something to that effect. There's specific days that they do these on, so you need to sort that out with the cashiers office.",

English is kind of different in that regard, but my HS grades were absolute garbage so when I decided to go back to school that's pretty much what I had to do for phys/chem/math. But you can always ask an instructor for approval for entering a class if you don't meet the pre-reqs. Unlikely if the course is in high demand, but if it's not overly saturated with students there's a good chance they'll just let you in if you're close-ish to having sufficient pre-reqs.\n\nBy the way, here's the [CapU page for the EDT](https://www.capilanou.ca/student-life/academic-support/learning-supports/english-diagnostic-test/) I mentioned.\n\nBut at any rate, entering CapU has a pretty low bar to pass, your only real concern is that your existing grades might just cost you a semester to get up to par with pre-reqs.",

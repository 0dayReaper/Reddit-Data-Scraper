It\u2019s an English 100 course that I need but non of the times work with my schedule so I\u2019m considering taking one that is this style\u2026 any insight on that? Is it worth paying for a course if it isn\u2019t really being taught ?",

I would say it\u2019s worth it as long as you watch the lectures and apply the material taught to your assignments.",

    "postText": "Oioioioi, if you have been accepted into MOPA make sure to pay the $200 deposit fee! You have until tomorrow. I only just got the email today (through my personal, not my CAP email) after I responded to confirm which program I would go into.  sOOOOO do it before it's too late, and if you haven't gotten said email the instructions to pay the fee are as following.\n\n* Go to your bank accounts website\n* Select Pay Bills. This might be under Bill payment. \n* Type in Capilano University and a list should come up with the first one being (who could believe) CAPILANO UNIVERSITY\n* Select and then add your student number \n* Pay the two hundo buckaroos\n\nand then your good! Hope to see you in the upcoming fall, (p.s. we've also got a soon to be MOPA Instagram group chat, so comment your insta and I'll be able to add you!) Yeye skrr skkr beep boop dab dab cheef keef free robbie ranch is overrated.",

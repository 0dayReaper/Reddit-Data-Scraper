    "postText": "Hey guys! Any of you are international student taking this summer term off? I\u2019ve heard that summer term is optional but is that also the case for international students since we have to like actively pursue our studies? If it is ok to do so do we just not register for courses and come back in the Fall? Urgg I\u2019m just so worried since I\u2019m visiting my country this summer and just now think about the possibility that because the school operates in 3 terms it might not be ok for me as an international student to take one off       :(((((",

I haven't found any mention of this issue on Cap's site, and I have tried multiple browsers, devices, and even incognito mode. Anyone here come across this issue?",

I\u2019d probably call the registrars office tomorrow and see if they can help.\n\nI did however notice you\u2019re able to drop a course through the drop link under \u201cmy schedule\u201d.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Right now, I'm getting a \"503 Service Unavailable\" message for the MyCapU service, with the message:\n\n&gt; ORDS was unable to make a connection to the database. This can occur if the database is unavailable, the maximum number of sessions has been reached or the pool is not correctly configured. The connection pool named: |apex|| had the following error(s): Exception occurred while getting connection: oracle.ucp.UniversalConnectionPoolException: All connections in the Universal Connection Pool are in use\n\nClearly there's something up with their servers, but if I get into MyCapU, I'll try your suggestion.",

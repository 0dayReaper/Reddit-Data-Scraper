    "postText": "I've already been accepted to UBC's kinesiology program for winter 2021, but I'm seriously considering CapU's new kinesiology program because of all the flack UBC's getting these days for not giving a hoot about their students during the pandemic.\n\nThe commute time would be a LOT shorter for me (and less hectic) and I feel like CapU would be a much more comfortable environment than UBC based on what my partner's told me.\n\nAnyone have any experiences they'd be willing to share of CapU? If anyone was in the human kinetics program that'd be awesome!\n\nThanks in advance!",

Smaller classes means better access to teachers and a closer relationship with classmates. Teachers are also really open to letting you in their classes if you\u2019re on the waitlist or have an issue with signing up (for example, most Business classes weren\u2019t \u201copen\u201d\u2019to Comms students). \n\nCapU\u2019s admin team is pretty great as well, the only issue I found over my years there was that more often than not classes we in session during poor weather, but I guess that would only be a major issue if you\u2019re commuting from outside of North Van like I was.",

They really go out of their way to help and make sure you understand. Obviously a few exceptions but for the most part all very helpful. The small class sizes really do make a difference. Had a classmate that transferred from UBC to Cap in order to actually learn something ( his words ). Very interesting program and I enjoyed it very much.",

Ubc is a reputable school and when it comes to kin and I assume you would like to go the Physio path or occupational therapist path... I believe ubc is the right school for you. It should make future transitions a lot easier and provides you with a  competitive advantage that you will realize in your networking events.",

The school is known for small class sizes, one of the best student unions and health and dental programs, and the school does care. If they mis-step and the issue is brought to the schools attention they will generally clear it up and take accountability. It's also really diverse and value international students. They use zoom and moodle for online learning. Plus the school is surrounded by trees. The only thing is  they need to work on the cafeteria options. Which they are working on.",

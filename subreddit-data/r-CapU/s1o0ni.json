I have some food issues so when it comes to food, I have to make sure it is actually okay. I\u2019ve seen some negative reviews. Anyone have any experiences on this?",

There is specials for the day as well as \"the grill\" which is fast food ideas avaliable consistently. Res has actually been posting their special menus for the week on their instagram which has been super helpful in planning meals.\n\nThat being said, I would absolutely recommend buying some groceries that can be prepared within your dorm room. I got a microwave pot from Pampered Chef to make pasta and it's been a lifesaver. Keeping some fruits or veggies and stuff for sandwiches or other easy meals is a great idea.\n\nFor the price, it's decent.",

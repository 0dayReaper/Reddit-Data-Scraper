I realized this subreddit is a little bit low on activity but I wanted to post here quickly just in case. \n\nI\u2019m from Ontario and while looking at different animation colleges Capilano really caught my attention and I was considering applying for next year.\n\nBut after stumbling upon this subreddit I noticed a couple of posts warning future applicants of how depressing the CapU social life is and how residence is crazy ??\nIf anyone has the time I would really appreciate some insight or someone\u2019s experience on what it is like studying/living there. \n\nI\u2019ve always loved the idea of going to the west coast to study but I was wondering if the students that are/were there even liked it",

            "comment": "I would be careful about how much you weigh the comments in this subreddit into your decision. Barely anyone posts on here, and when people do a lot of the time they come to rant, so you're not getting an accurate depiction of what the majority of people/the average person would say about Cap. Some of the comments are old too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've heard good things about living in residence. It's true the residence is off campus, but it's not far away. It's a 20 minute bus ride, but that's only because of the direction the buses run. If you drove, for example, you could get there in 5 minutes *easy* (and there are [Evos](https://evo.ca/) parked at the residence and on campus). \n\nI find the social life pretty good there, but I'm also quite involved. If you come to school just for class, then go home, yeah, you're not gonna have any friends (gee, I wonder why). \n\nThe social life can also vary by program. For someone in Arts &amp; Sciences like me, you'll meet people in class, but then it's up to you to make plans to see them outside of that class (e.g. plan to study in the library, go for lunch, do things off-campus outside of school). \n\nFor a program like 2D/3D animation, you're in a cohort, which basically means a smaller group of students that all take classes together. It's *much* easier to make friends in a cohort program. You'll always have classes with the same people, so the advantage of that is you'll be familiar with everyone. The cohorts on campus tend to be pretty tight knit, and by that I don't mean \"never let anyone into our clique\" but rather \"we're all pretty much family at this point.\" The animation students don't really spare themselves a lot of time to do a whole lot of socializing though, but that may not be the rule. Maybe it's just the animation students I've met that tell me they're there all day working on their art (I think it's because they're so passionate about it). \n\nI don't know too much about animation in general, but I do know Cap has one of the best programs around and the name carries a lot of weight in the industry. \n\nAlso, Vancouver is like one of the best cities in the world, if not the best. So there's that.",

                    "comment": "Yo as someone who went through the 2D animation program there I can attest to the tight-knit feel of the cohort you're in. You're all in the muck fighting for the exact same thing so there's a level of comraderie and understanding that can develop to some pretty deep friendships!\n\nThough I will say the animation students not sparing a lot of time socializing absolutely is the rule. With the amount of work the program puts you through, after the first month of the first semester you basically have the time to go to school, the time to eat, and the time to sleep. Most people come into school on their off time to work and those that don't are almost always staying at home because they're able to work from there. It's not a program to take lightly by any means, because to take someone from a basic understanding of art to a professional level in two years requires a ton of work. That's one of the reasons you become so tight knit with your classmates, you have so little time outside of school that your classmates are the best and sometimes only opportunity for socializing you'll get.\n\nI've heard of people who have had part time jobs (maybe 1.5 shifts a week on average) in the first and sometimes the second semester, but I've never heard of anyone who was able to manage both a part time job and the 2D program in the third or fourth semesters. There's just no time. When I went through it I could only see my friends outside of school once a month if I was lucky. The program demands your attention.\n\nThat being said, it's still an incredibly fun program. You're there working hard because everyone else is working just as hard and inspiring you, and you're working on projects that are quite a lot of fun and very exciting to get through! You want to push yourself! It's hard work and you'll end up exhausted, but it's that nice level of exhaustion you get after you just completed a marathon. You feel very accomplished! As well, the industry in Vancouver is incredibly social and once you start working the social situation gets completely flipped on its head. If you can slog it out through the two years of hard work the program puts you through, you'll be able to find great success and plenty of friends in the city!\n\nI would highly recommend this program. I have many problems with Capilano itself and especially how they've handled the tuition for the animation programs, but the program is handled and taught by some of the best in the city. You won't be disappointed!",

It's an awesome campaign run by some even more awesome people\n\n\\-there are lots of paid jobs on campus you could apply for, like being a Student Ambassador, a Career Development Ambassador, working in the Student Life Hub, working at the CSU, etc.\n\n\\-working as a [CapUWorks](https://www.capilanou.ca/student-life/campus-community/peers-helping-peers/peers-helping-peers-programs/) student is a unique job opportunity where you get to work in the Sustainability Office of the university do some really cool stuff\n\n\\-getting involved with the Capilano Students' Union. Every student enrolled in at least one course at Cap U is automatically a member of the Capilano Students' Union (CSU). You pay fees to them included in your tuition for services they coordinate and deliver, like the IT Repair Service, U-Pass, the Health &amp; Dental insurance plan, recreation, advocacy, etc. The CSU advocates for student interests on behalf of students to the university's administration and all levels of government. They consign used textbooks, oversee and fund all the clubs on campus, etc. \n\nAll students can attend Committee meetings or Board meetings of the CSU. You can apply to sit on a CSU Committee as a student-at-large, and you get $25 per meeting! You can also **run to be an elected representative** on the CSU Board of Directors, which makes you partially responsible for governing the organization, for which you get a stipend of $300 /month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-You can also **run to be an elected student representative** on the university's Board of Governors and/or Senate. The Board of Governors is the university's top decision making body, and the Senate is the place where all the academic stuff gets figured out. Both are really cool and will give you **excellent** experience for your resume. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's more, I could go on, but you get the idea. PM me if you have more questions.",

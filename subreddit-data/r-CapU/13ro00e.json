    "postText": "Hey r/CapU! \n\nContemplating if you should get a second dose of the vaccine to protect against mpox (formerly called monkeypox)? The answer is a big yes!\n\nVancouver Coastal Health is reminding people who are two-spirit, transgender, gay or bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, that getting both doses of the mpox (Imvamune) vaccine is the way to go for stronger and longer-lasting protection against infection.\n\nOne of the common signs of mpox is a rash. It usually sticks around for about 2 to 3 weeks and can show up on various parts of your body, such as the genitals, mouth, hands, feet, arms, or legs. The rash goes through different stages, starting as raised spots, then turning into fluid-filled blisters, and finally forming a scab that eventually falls off. [Here's a visual example of what mpox sores/blisters can look like over time.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsMTm_7swY7/?igshid=MTIyMzRjYmRlZg==)\n\nIf you happen to experience any mpox symptoms, you can get assessed by your primary care provider, at Sexual Health clinics, at an Urgent and Primary Care Centre, or head straight to the Emergency Department. They'll help you figure out if you need any additional testing or not.\n\nSo if it's been at least 28 days since your first dose, it's time to lock in that appointment for your second dose. For those who haven't received their first dose, you can also book an appointment here:  [https://www.vch.ca/en/service/mpox-vaccinations#wysiwyg--69416](https://www.vch.ca/en/service/mpox-vaccinations#wysiwyg--69416)",

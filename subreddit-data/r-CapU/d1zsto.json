    "postText": "Hello, I'm a new student at CapU and was wondering where the Tabletop-roleplaying club room is and what day I can walk into the room (if there even is a room) to speak with someone, as I'm interested in signing up. Also when do players meet up with a group to play is it in a particular room on campus or is it somewhere off-campus. when does the club start playing, will I have to wait a few weeks before the club becomes active. Is it a weekly or bi-weekly club, will I play with groups multiple times a week or once a week.\n\n  \nI know It must be a lost cause to post here and ask a question, but it's worth my time to try.  \n\n\nAny and all info is helpful.\n\n  \nTL:DR What room is the Dungeons and Dragons club in, and what day and hour can I go in to meet the club members",

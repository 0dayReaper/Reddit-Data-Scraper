    "postText": "Are you looking to get involved with a volunteer opportunity to work with humanitarian outreach and marginalized groups? Well look no further. The Humanitarian Organization For Providing Empowerment, also known as the HOPE Initiative, is looking to start new clubs at postsecondary institutions all over Canada. HOPE is a student run non-profit organization based in the Lower Mainland, and it has three pillars.\n\nThe first pillar of HOPE is **student empowerment**, which provides each member the opportunity to take leadership of a project within a committee. Whether that is starting a new mentorship program or working with marginalized groups, it is completely up to you! The second pillar is **outreach within schools**, focused upon a series of workshops aimed at helping high school students with their university applications and discover other possibilities for after graduation. Our third pillar focuses on **marginalized community groups**, and our work in the past has focused on populations such as the homeless. Our major event, Warmth of Winter, aims to create connections, hold conversations, and provide care packages to individuals in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, where many residents are experiencing homelessness. \n\nThe HOPE website is [https://www.thehopeinitiative.ca/](https://www.thehopeinitiative.ca/), (or find our other socials using [https://campsite.bio/ubc\\_hope](https://campsite.bio/ubc_hope)) and the published interviews on displaced individuals can be read here [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnk20xmh3z6cjbr/UBCHOPE\\_Stories\\_Revised1.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnk20xmh3z6cjbr/UBCHOPE_Stories_Revised1.pdf?dl=0) or on our Facebook page.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to gain leadership experience and take action to empower those around you. Feel free to message me for more information. Please fill out the quick and easy google form below and someone from the team will be in touch with you. We look forward to working with you! \n\n[https://forms.gle/ovcZCeZ2jVG8AUUC8](https://forms.gle/ovcZCeZ2jVG8AUUC8)",

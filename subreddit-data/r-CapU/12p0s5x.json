    "postText": "Has anyone else experienced ordering an official transcript from CapU to another university institution? I am returning to school in the fall and had to order my official transcript be sent to the institution (which is also in Canada). But it has been 10 days since it was apparently mailed and the receiving institution has not received it yet. I'm thinking of waiting until end of week before reordering. Just checking if this has happened to anyone else or if anyone has any suggestions with handling this.",

They have recently changed the buses, so the only buses that go all the way to the school are the 245 and 255.\n\nThe 245 acts as a shuttle to and from Cap U and Phibbs Exchange. Here are all the buses that stop at Phibbs:\n\nComing from over the Second Narrows Bridge (so from Vancouver or Burnaby): 28, 130, 209, 210, 211, 212, 214, 215, 222, 227, 232, 245\n\nComing from somewhere on the North Shore: R2 (formerly the 239, now a B Line route), 209, 210, 211, 214, 215, 227, 232, 245",

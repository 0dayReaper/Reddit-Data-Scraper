You learn from industry professionals and practice with industry standard equipment. I can't realistically say I know for sure what is better, but I know from personal friends within the film industry in Vancouver that Capilano is actually seen as one of the better film schools to be recognized from. \n\nHope this helps, feel free to private message me if you have any more question.",

As for MOPA I can assure that you're learning industry standard information and get excellent hands on experience. MOPA prides itself on being a more hands on program assuring that you make a film or two every year. \n\nI assume UBC has a pretty in depth program in theory, probably more than MOPA, but I'm pretty sure you get more hands on experience at MOPA with gear.",

I thought it was the latter, but then I suddenly remembered the first two years of MOPA is a \"diploma,\" and most diplomas only make students learn courses related to one field they focus on. So you know, just making double-checking. I would appreciate answers from anyone who knows the answer. Thanks in advance! :)",

Going into 3rd and 4th year I believe that all your classes stay film related but you can pick specifics around them. If you go to Capilano's website and look at the Program requirements for the Motion Picture Art Degree it shows you the specific courses you get to choose from in the later years.",

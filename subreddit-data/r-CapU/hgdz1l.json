    "postText": "I\u2019ve lived in the residence for almost a year and it\u2019s been horrible. I\u2019m moving out at the end of the summer term the security guards and the dinning fall staff are all very nice and polite. A few off the office staff as well. Management other then that  horrible. We have a visitor restriction since March I understand because of COVID however we are given no information and there rules regarding how it\u2019s better to safer only socializing with other students is BS you put yourself at risk no matter what. I\u2019ve complained several times about the lack of information and pointed how it makes no sense and I\u2019ve been met with a rude response every time. Mangers don\u2019t care so if you want to live in a decent safe place don\u2019t move in. We are also supposed to getting international student later in the month which is not ok. Like one our borders are closed and we should not be letter people form outside the country in right now. We are also now only allowed to pick up are mail after 4:30pm Monday-Friday. In terms of food we are basically down to one mean a day we are paying to eat one meal a day which is a complete waste. They should truthfully close the dinning hall in this time or give us three meals a day. We are forced to say for meal plan even though we get a kitchen to cook in the summer term. They also have deuces to fall residence as a lottery priority and not giving current student a priority in general. The only reason I\u2019ve been offered housing is because I sent an email pointing out how they would be kicking up a number of students which is unfair and they didn\u2019t inform us until the middle of June I was told we where told in advance which so not true This is not a good place to live and over all is just a waste of time and money. If you come to the residence don\u2019t except staff to care. This post is somewhat of rant but also for if Info this is what\u2019s currently happened.  This is warning for anyone considering living here don\u2019t just don\u2019t.",

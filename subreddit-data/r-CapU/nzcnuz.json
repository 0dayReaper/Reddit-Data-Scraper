Second, I'm going into my 3rd year in the Mopa program and for your schedule they will send you one closer to the fall semester. Just sit tight and keep an eye on your Capilano email as they send you everything through that. \n\nFinally, if you got any questions specific to the Mopa program I'm glad to help answer any of them as best as I can.",

Regarding the schedule page where you pick what time your classes will be on, do you only have to schedule your Mopa 100 and your ENGL 100 classes if you are a first-year?  I am a little confused. I set all my classes from 1-3:50 so I'm assuming my spot for that day is confirmed. Also, Mopa 103, 115, and 118 aren't available this term as said by the scheduling website. Is that something I should be worried about?",

Mopa program works a bit differently since a full time course. You will be split up into 4 different cohorts and each cohort will be emailed with specific classes to sign up for (they're specific to cohort and they send you instructions). Keep an eye on your student email they send everything there. From what I remember my English 100 course was also given to me in an email as I was supposed to pick a specific one. Unfortunately you don't get to really pick your times for classes.\n\nI wouldn't worry about not being able to sign up on the schedule yet as some of those classes might not be available till second semester.\n\nPM me if your still confused and I can try to explain it better.",

First semester starts in sep, but you can sign up for courses from next month when you get your time ticket! \n\nAnyway, I would love to get to know you so dm me and i'll send you my socials!",

    "postText": "Hey there, grade twelve student here. I've applied to the motion picture arts program at CapU and am waiting on acceptance. If I were to be accepted, I would likely be moving closer to campus (I currently live out in Langley, and can't drive. Transit would take too long from where I live, too). Is the residence that CapU offers worth it? It looks pretty good from the picture online, and it's a fair price compared to renting in North Van \ud83d\ude44, but looking at reviews, I see a lot of negative ones. Anybody here have an opinion? Is it better to apply for residence if I get accepted, or should I look at housing elsewhere?",

            "comment": "I lived in residence my first year of MOPA. There are definitely some issues with living on res(the food can be really hit or miss and the bathrooms/showers leave a lot to be desired), but overall I had a good experience there. The biggest thing I got from residence was the social experience. I had a roommate I really liked, and met a group of friends that I\u2019ve lived with the past two years now. \n\nIf you\u2019re moving out of your parents for the first time, it\u2019s a nice adjustment to living \u201con your own\u201d while not having to really worrying about making meals and cleaning etc.\n\nGood luck on getting into MOPA!",

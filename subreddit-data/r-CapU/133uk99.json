    "postText": "Hi, I am in a bit of a pickle right now and I wanted to know if anyone here knew how to help. I applied to CapU for the 3D Animation for Film and Games program of fall 2023 on March 10 and was told I would get an answer mid April. But I have not heard from them since.\nI applied and got accepted into a different college, not as good as CapU but still very decent, but I have to pay for the first semester by May 3. Meaning I have three days now. Is there any way I can get my answer today? Is anyone else in a similar situation?",

They had their representative in my country and called me every day that \u201cSir you got a seat here and just a reminder to pay the minimum deposit amount to secure your seat, we got so many applications this year and we can\u2019t guarantee a seat after the fee deadline blah blah blah\u201d. If they have gave you a seat, call them and they would be able to help you with that. Call them tomorrow morning as soon as they start.",

I am working with an agency and they communicated with CapU asking if they had an answer yet to either be accepted or move on. But they answered my application was still under review. I just wish they would tell me to know where I am currently standing, regardless if its positive or not",

I've recently been accepted to the 2D Animation program, and am trying to decide if i will accept my offer. \n\nI will have to commute from Mount Pleasant every day, and I'd also like to keep a weekend job while studying. Is anyone able to tell me what the workload and work/life balance are in this program? Or do most people end up living in the studio 7 days a week?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny tips for success in the program would also be genuinely appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Hey there! 2D animation grad here!\n\nFirst off, congrats on getting into the program! That's not an easy thing to do, you must've worked hard to get in!\n\nI had to commute from Coquitlam each day so I feel you there (1.5 hours each way, yikes!) but I will say that if you're someone who isn't prone to motion sickness it's a fantastic time to study and draw. I tried to make the most of those 1.5 hours by sketching people on the bus and studying from textbooks. And if you've got a job? You'll probably need that time. Also, I knew some people who commuted from Surrey, and even Langley (though the Langley student ended up moving closer for third semester).\n\nOf the about 4-5 seperate years I have knowledge of, I know of quite a few people who had a job in the first semester, the people who had a job in the second semester I could almost count on one hand, and only one single person had a part time job in the third semester and he had to quit that job halfway through due to the workload. **This is not an easy program.** This is a program that has to squeeze a shitton of industry-relevant information into the span of two years and get you ready for a career right after, so there's very little time for much else. I found that myself, along with many other people I knew, had a fairly reliable schedule of school, study, sleep, repeat, relying on the Winter, Summer, and reading breaks to catch up with the friends we hadn't seen in that time. After first semester, I usually saw some of my closer friends about once or twice a month if even that. \n\nBE PREPARED! You will have to work hard, you will have to sacrifice much of your social life, you will have to constantly fight off sleep in early morning classes **but it is also very much worth it!** Most people running through the program get into a job right afterwards and the consistent level of improvement I see from the freshman to the graduates is always some of the most impressive signs of growth I've seen from a school. I've seen people go from barely being able to draw a figure to having work that got them **hired before they even had the chance to graduate**.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a dead social life either! One of the great things about this program is that everyone is being put through the ringer together, so that means you'll always be surrounded by classmates you can relate to. You're not alone when going through this, so make sure you find some people you can study and work on homework with and you'll improve drastically (and as a bonus there's no risk of losing your sanity from isolating yourself!).\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to tips for success in the program I have three important things to note:\n\n1: Proper time management. **You don't have to pull all-nighters** but some people will. If you're pulling an all nighter it's probably because you've procrastinated or are making something absolutely bonkers cool, but even then I promise you're not getting as much work done as you would if you took time off to sleep, and the quality will suffer too. Make sure you're getting as much rest as you can, or you'll find it harder to remember the immense amount of information being handed to you\n\n2: **Take the time to learn, not to show off.** You're not going to be producing portfolio-ready material until at least third semester, so there's no need to go crazy on the polish! Keeping things simple and rough gives you time to experiment and explore multiple ideas which is incredibly important! You can always polish things til the cows come home but if the initial idea isn't good then you haven't learned as much as you could and it'll show! Don't worry about things looking \"good,\" worry about whether or not you've explored the concept in multiple ways. My personal recommendation for this is to not even think about portfolio materials until the final semester so you can spend as much time learning as possible. If you try to focus on polish and making things look \"good\" instead of finding effective ideas, you may find you could only explore one idea before the deadline and you might not even like it! The students who have top notch assignments are always the ones that played with the idea before they executed it.\n\nside note for #2, so long as you put effort in it's almost impossible to fail any class (except for animation history and english, beware!) so don't worry too much about grades or failing out. Play the long game, focus on improvement.\n\n3: Make friends, form study groups. Don't just study what the homework is, study around the homework. Use the homework as a base and bounce ideas off of each other to form new, connected ideas. Encourage your friends to learn and grow, so that you may learn off of whatever skills they build. People sometimes treat the program as a bit of competition, and a bit of healthy competition is fun and motivating, but if you isolate yourself in that competition you'll only suffer so make sure you're learning off as many people as possible!\n\nAnyways I think i'm rambling at this point. If you end up taking the program I wish you the best of luck, it's a fantastic program!\n\nAlso, fuck Cap's leadership for the tuition increase. I said it on the last post and I'll say it again, the increase was unfair and it's the only hesitation I have in recommending the school. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on reddit or through my e-mail, info@nickleong.ca!",

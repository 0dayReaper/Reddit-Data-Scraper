I asked them when I\u2019d hear back and they said \u201cwe\u2019re constructing interviews at the moment, interviews will take place in the next few weeks.\u201d That was the first week of March.\n\nEDIT: \u201cearly admission\u201d, not \u201cearly application\u201d",

I\u2019m a current MOPA student who volunteered during the interviews. \n\nI applied for early admissions in Dec 2017, had a Skype interview in mid Feb 2018, and was admitted very early May 2018. \nEDIT: Double checked my emails and I actually got my admission notice on March 16th. \n\nHowever, I was speaking to one of the instructors in charge of the interviews and she mentioned they hadn\u2019t even reviewed all the applications yet, and haven\u2019t made any decisions yet. There seems to be quite a high volume this year, and they\u2019ve also drastically changed the interview structure which might be why there\u2019s a delay. ",

When my peers and I did our interviews it was you, and two instructors. I think my interview took around 15-20 minutes. Now it\u2019s a group of 5-7 interviewees with two instructors and the entire process runs about an hour. It\u2019s their first year doing this process so I imagine they had to fine tune their decision making process with the new structure. \n\nI also know they\u2019ve already interviewed probably close to 400 students, and the class size for 1st year is around 100-120 so it\u2019ll be a competitive decision.

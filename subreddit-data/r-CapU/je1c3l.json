    "postText": "Hi Reddit! I have my bachelor of design already, and I worked as a designer for a year. Now I think I want to go back to school to learn something new. I am always interested in psychology and special education, and I am considering further my study at UBC special education master program( my final goal). Any suggestions on the diploma, certificate or bachelor?\nI prefer doing research and write academic thesis rather than being a supervisor. Is this program suitable for me?\nThanks a lot!",

The first two years prepares you for this. Theres a small batch of students every year with about 4-5 professors that help teach and organize everything.",

I know there is a 1000 hour field work requirement prior to take the BCaBA examination and you need a supervision, do you need to find all those opportunities by yourself or the university provides you the chance of meeting BCBA? \nHow do you balance field work and study in third and fourth year though?",

If you are in BC there are facebook groups where you can see job postings or post a profile about yourself and availability.",

Before you start your supervision, you learn about how to convert hours. This made it so much easier to get the hours but you definitely need to find consistent work. \n\nI worked in a clinical setting so it was easier to obtain those hours. I can imagine it being more difficult to get those hours if you work on multiple teams. \n\nThe downside to working on independent teams is that many BCBAs will charge you over hour for supervision. Though working in a clinical setting, you might have to works those hours unpaid. \n\nGood luck!",

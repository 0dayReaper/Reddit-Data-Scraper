I\u2019m starting at Cap this fall and want to make a draft of my course schedule so that when I can apply I know what courses I want to take and how they best fit into the schedule... but it won\u2019t let me select fall 2021 so I\u2019m not able to do this... any suggestions?",

Last year the time tickets were released June 26th so you\u2019ll have to wait till then to be able to build a schedule. \n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "I'm trying to get a better picture of the bachelor of motion picture arts degree at Cap U - do many people opt out of completing the entire 4 years? What's it like in the 1st and 2nd year compared to the 3rd and 4th? Has the first 2 years of the course been  sufficient/instrumental to finding work after receiving the diploma and  does the school try to bridge students with industry professionals? What kind of equipment (camera/grip/lighting) are made available to the students?",

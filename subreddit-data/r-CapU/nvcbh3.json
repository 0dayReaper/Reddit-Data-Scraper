I\u2019d love to know.\n\nI\u2019m going to be living on campus at the start of Fall 2020, and I\u2019d really like to have some people I already know when I arrive. Any advice would also be appreciated. \n\nI\u2019ve already taken note of some clubs I\u2019d be into joining. If anyone wants to chat feel free to dm, thanks!",

It felt like high school all over again, when confronted with this, the student union said there was a program thats only available for freshmen and I was denied any help, tbh they dont care as long as you keep paying their fees.\n\n\nAlso as you may not the avg vancouverite is very socially awkward and cant talk with random people, I think it comes from the area be careful, the native vancouverite is aloof and fake. Try to befriend ppl from Ontario if you have the chance.\n\nJust look at this topic, the op asked a question about the town and was suspended for it, expect this intolerant behavior in all of lower mainland, you cant ever comment or criticize the town in any way shape or form. The only difference is that in rl it will be hidden, disguised as something else just to make your life worse or harder.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/o4mrv5/why_do_people_get_so_defensive_when_talking_about/",

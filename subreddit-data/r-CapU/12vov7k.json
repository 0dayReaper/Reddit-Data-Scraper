    "postText": "Hi, I just have a question about the April 24th Fee payment deadline [https://www.capilanou.ca/about-capu/get-to-know-us/events/items/fee-payment-deadline--summer-2023.php], is this for all summer fees as in tuition and courses? \n\nI saw that you can continue to add and drop courses for Summer 2023 starting April 27th after it closes on the 24th, so my line of thought leads me to that courses are also separately paid if you add a new course after?\n\nAlso, since it can take up to 3 business days for the online payment option, if I were to file these payments now, would it make it in time before the deadline on the 24th?\n\nI am a transfering student from Uvic, so this deadline is unfamiliar to me, usually the deadlines are after the final drop course dates.\n\nI appreciate any help!",

            "comment": "Yes, courses are separately paid after the deadline. Send the payment, take a screenshot. Email the registrars office with said screenshot and submit a fee deferral. Call the office on Monday and let them know you\u2019ve paid and you\u2019ve sent over proof of payment. They will typically approve the deferral which prevents you from being dropped from all unpaid courses.",

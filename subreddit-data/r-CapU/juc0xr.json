    "postText": "Looking to take an upper level breadth elective to finish my BBA this spring or summer 2021 semester. Any BBA students here have a suggestion? I took HIST 326 as one, and I'd like to take another history class but they are often restricted to majors in arts or motion picture. Same deal with many other classes. I'm also curious whether I should take an elective this spring or summer semester, because it looks like there are way less options in the summer and I'd really like my graduation not to be stalled because of an elective. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

If you focus your energy into your letter of intent (and supplemental materials if they\u2019re doing that this year) then you\u2019ll be sitting pretty.\n\nAlso, the \u2018interviews\u2019 can make a positive impact if you\u2019re struggling. The process is actually quite fun/exciting, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find yourself in your element on the day. Good luck.",

While grades are considered, the letter of intent and interviews are really the key imo. This program and this industry is highly collaborative and they\u2019re looking to see who you are as a person and if you can play nicely with others tbh.",

            "comment": "I was there for 8 months, 2018/2019. Coming from living alone for a few years to residence was pretty rough, but if you've never lived alone I imagine it's pretty fine. The food was tolerable but pretty static, but I'm the kinda person that could eat like the same three things I like for the rest of my life and be pretty content; and also you get a bunch of credits that can be used at the uni cafeterias. It'll be a tad more economical than renting in the surround area, but it's just a matter of balancing QOL and budget. It's off campus, and like 15 minutes to bus, but if you're late to line up, you could miss a bus due to how many people are commuting, so you'll want to budget 20-25 minutes for commuting to be on time. There's also Evo's at both the residence and campus, so that's also an option ($0.50/min), noting, I'm not aware of any car share services that cover North Van excluding very select spots. Unless of course you have your own car already. Their little \"make a bio and match with a roommate\" portal thing was nice though. There was a number of people in residence that if I had been randomly assigned with, there'd be 0 chance I would've stuck around. Ended up matching with a great roommate. Also, when I was there the showers were only getting cleaned like once a month. I think they might have upped the frequency a tad during my last month or two.\n\nPro-tip: apparently if you state some mental health issues like high anxiety in shared room situations or inability to fall asleep or study around people, or something to that effect, there's a good chance you can get a room to yourself.\n\nPersonally, I'd say if being in constant social contact with other students isn't one of your top concerns, rent a room in the area, or perhaps do a short term rental in the area until you make some friends and rent a place together. The QOL difference was too significant for me to be willing to stay having been there, but I'm coming from a pretty privileged position and being a relatively solitary person, and I know for a lot of people renting a decent place isn't a viable route financially while going through school (which is itself a full time job).",

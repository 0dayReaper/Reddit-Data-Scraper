I am planing to apply for the Associate of Science Degree with some of the computer science courses to transfer to UBC or SFU 3rd year. Have anyone have done that may I ask some questions:\n\n1. Is it competitive?\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\n2. When I search some computer science course at CAPU and transfer to UBC course(bc transfer guide) I think CAPU doesn\u2019t have enough courses for CS course 1st and 2nd year at UBC( maybe i did something wrong)\n3. Has anyone known about this can give me some tips(Anything is appreciated)",

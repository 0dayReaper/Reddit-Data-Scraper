    "postText": "So I recently got accepted into the paralegal degree program for the upcoming fall semester and I got the terms and conditions email for this program. It requires that I must be at a gpa of 3.0 at the end of the second year and a minimum cumulative average of 3.0 by the end of fourth year. This honestly sounds terrifying and I would like to know if it\u2019s really hard trying to achieve those grades? Are there any tips or advice or \u201cthings I wish I knew beforehand\u201d that I should know? \n\nThanks!!",

If this is your first time in university expect it to be significantly more work than highschool. IMO it\u2019s way more interesting than highschool though",

I'm not saying it is easy, but it is not very difficult either. As long as you keep up with the readings/assignments, then you will have no problem keeping a 3.0 GPA. CapU grading scale is also very forgiving, 3.0GPA being 73-76%. Everything is recorded now so you don't necessarily need to go to class at the specified time. Further, half the time the lecturer is just repeating what was in the lecture notes. I don't find lectures to be that useful at the moment. \n\nThe introductory courses so far (Law 110 and Law 210) all mark very easy and don't necessarily test your memory. The assignments/exams mostly test application of the material, which is the important part in being a paralegal anyway. In terms of course load, Law 110 last term had quite a few things to read/do each week but were manageable on top of working full time. If you're taking the diploma program, I can't speak to the course load with 6 courses per term.",

Knowing that the grading scale is different than what I\u2019m used to (SFU grading scale) I feel like I should be able to do this!\n\nThanks!!",

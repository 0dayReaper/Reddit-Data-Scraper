Theres also some sites that *cough* have the textbooks there for free(but you didn\u2019t hear that from me) If it\u2019s in person bring smt to hold your syllabus\u2019 and pens and a planner for important dates. When it gets closer to September you\u2019ll get an email from your profs and to log into Moodle which will have all your info ready for your classes. Maybe bring any questions you have for the prof as well! Feel free to ask any questions here too, I\u2019m going into my 4th year at Cap so no pressure.",

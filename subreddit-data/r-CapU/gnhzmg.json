I know times are unprecedented and tough so I'm very appreciative I got such a detailed answer, kindly provided by Instructor Don Perro.\n\nThought I'd share. If anyone is interested, here's the question and answer: [https://imgur.com/a/t57fEjj](https://imgur.com/a/t57fEjj)",

Have you been in touch with any graduates or students who have  experienced it  in spring term , it would be great to know their thoughts about it?",

But I have accepted now because I feel the instructors, and especially Don, who so kindly replied, seem to be extremely dedicated into making this work, no matter the changing circumstances.\n\nI myself haven't talked to any CapU graduates students so I don't know. But I assume you can ask the question in this subreddit and you'll get some replies.",

I have read the guidelines on the website but I still can\u2019t figure out what level of drawing skills is able to meet the requirement. Also, is it really hard to get in? Thank you.",

I\u2019m a current 2nd year 2D Student and I would be more than happy to take a look at what you have so far or I can send you my entrance portfolio to get a feel for what they are looking for.  It\u2019s difficult to say if it\u2019s hard to get in because it really all depends on your skill level",

Even smaller studios like Titmouse get around that range. 3D is quite profitable, but not worth quitting a passion over it. Ever since streaming platforms started short production seasons, 2D animation has been booming, while 3D is getting more expensive because of the current age graphical and motion standards. 2D is probably going to be even more lucrative now that more countries like Japan are trying to fix their low wage bracket in that industry.",

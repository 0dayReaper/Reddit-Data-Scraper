    "postText": "Has anyone here taken the math placement test (MPT) for enrolment into a math course? I'm looking to take the calculus one specifically to get into MATH 116 but any advice/info generally would be much appreciated.\n\nIs there a particular score I have to achieve to pass? If I don't pass, do I just go into the pre-req class (MATH 105)? I read that you can only take the test once every twelve months so I would really like to not screw this up for myself.\n\nThanks!",

I have been reviewing the material though, but still nervous about it tbh. \n\nShould I just opt for the pre-calc MPT then and start in 105? I\u2019m doing an associates degree so my time at capu will be somewhat limited, but if that\u2019s what I have to do then so be it.",

The once every 12 month rule applied to each version of the MPT so you are allowed to take the Calc MPT and the Precalculus MPT within 12 months. \n\nFor specific advice, email the math department directly.

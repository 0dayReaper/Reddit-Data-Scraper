    "postText": "Hi everybody!\n\nMy name is Ana, and I work at Angry Butterfly, a market research company. We are looking to learn more about **18 to 30 years old university/college students**' personal experiences and thoughts on wellness, health and nutrition.\n\nThe research will take place next week and consist of a 1 hour 30 min interview on Zoom.\n\nBut first, I would like to have a quick 10 min chat with you to get to know you better, explain a little bit more about our research and see if you are interested and available to take part in our study.\n\nSelected participants will get a thank you incentive to be disclosed after our pre-screener meeting.\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please send me a message here and I'll schedule our talk!\n\nCheers,\n\nAna",
